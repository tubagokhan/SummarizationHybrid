{"all_intermediate_summary": ["a recent systematic analysis showed that in 2011 314 296 331 million children younger than 5 years were mildly moderately or severely stunted and 258 240 274 million were mildly moderately or severely underweight in the developing countries . hence nutritional value of the nffp is lower than the scientific recommended snacks for this age group . furthermore lack of variety of food packages has decreased the tendency of children toward nffp . according to the aim of this study and multiple factors that could affect the problem public health advocacy has been chosen as the best strategy to deal with this issue . in coordination with education organization of fars province two elementary schools and one middle school in the third region of the urban area of shiraz were selected randomly . for this report the children s height and weight were entered into center for disease control and prevention cdc to calculate bmi and bmi for age z scores based on cdc for diseases control and prevention and growth standards . standing height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm with a wall mounted stadiometer . accordingly education of these booklets has been integrated into regular education of students and they educated and justified for better nutrition life style . after these meetings parental desire for participation in the project illustrated the effectiveness of the justification meeting with them . demographic information height weight and knowledge of the students were measured by use of a validated and reliable cronbach s alpha was 0.61 questionnaire . chicago il usa . 2336 80.5 out of total students were well off and 561 children 19.5 were indigent . 19.5 of subjects were in case group n 561 and 80.5 were in the control group n 2336 . however negligence of under poverty line providing poor snacks in terms of nutritional value and lack of variety are the main defects of this program . at baseline no significant difference was founded among wealthy students between the pre and post nutritional status intervention . a recent publication has shown that school feeding programs focus on milk supplementation had beneficial effects on the physical function and school performances specifically among girls in iran . another choice was community involvement which can be achieved by female health volunteers who are working with the health system . advocacy team by using the support of charities and female health volunteers could establish a local factory that produced student s snacks based on the new definition . although in a limited number of schools in our study interventions and advocacy program was successful expanding this model to another areas around the country depends on convincing the policy makers at national level . assessing the dietary adherence is very important in nutrition intervention among population .", "blood transfusion is an effective way to replace depleted hb within a short period but the effect is unfortunately temporary and can cause serious adverse risks and increased mortality . at the first clinic visit week 1 baseline a blood sample was obtained for laboratory assessments before the study treatment was started . complete laboratory assessment hb serum ferritin reticulocyte count transferrin tsat serum iron total iron binding capacity red cell indices white blood cell count with differential platelet count and serum chemistries were done at week 1 and at week 14 end of study . a significance criterion of p 0.05 was used in the analysis . chemotherapy varied according to the primary cancer and included anthracycline platinum taxanes cyclophosphamide high dose ifosfamide vincristine vinblastine bleomycin and others . as seen in table 2 the mean hb level of the 25 patients at baseline was 9.6 g dl median 9.9 g dl range 6.9 g dl10.9 g dl . although the role of esas is well established in treating caa big concerns were recently raised about the negative effect of esas on survival in some patients with cancer.911 concerns about the risk for thromboembolism in patients with cancer with higher hb levels who are receiving esa were also addressed in many trials.2223 in addition the possible immunosuppressive effects of blood product transfusions that may have relevance to neoplasia progression were addressed before.24 25 in our pilot study we tested the feasibility of using iron supplementation alone to treat anemia in patients with cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy without the use of esas or blood transfusion which could be a valid alternative especially for patients with curable cancers . a large prospective safety comparison trial failed to show serious anaphylactoid reactions27 which is confirmed in our study in which no patients developed reactions and no patients withdrew from the study because of adverse effects .", ". among this olanzapine is thought to have preferential action at mesolimbic over nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways and is therefore associated with a very low incidence of extrapyramidal symptom eps . careful history exploration revealed he was taking risperidone 2 mg irregularly for 2 months and then olanzapine 5 mg for another 4 months . according to the mother one friend might have threatened made fun of him actually and after that patient stopped going out of house and displayed above mentioned symptoms . during 210 years of age patient was inattentive and mildly hyperactive . he left the schooling . after 2 months there was some improvement of around 30 . after 12 months of treatment patient has improved around 90 with tetrabenazine 75 mg levodopa carbidopa 100 25 tablet bd and clonazepam 1 mg bd . the patients understand that their names and initials will not be published and due efforts will be made to conceal their identity but anonymity can not be guaranteed .", "although biological agents can help manage these insect pests insecticides currently are essential for large scale effective and economical pest control . although immune pathways can be generally and non specifically inhibited by pesticides they also are a likely source of candidate molecules that could be inhibited for target specific insect control since multiple classes of insect immunity genes including signaling pathways can be under strong selection for diversification . also their immune signaling pathways are gradually being revealed by genomic and transcriptomic data 3238 . amps are small cationic peptides that insert into and disrupt microbial membranes thereby killing and clearing pathogens . amps are a conserved component of immunity in plants and animals and while they have diverse structures most can be assigned to larger families such as cecropins attacins defensins and diptericins . after amps are translated in the cytoplasm they are released into the hemolymph where their high concentrations and broad activity are thought to enhance clearance of invading microorganisms from the insect . bioinformatic and experimental data support the existence of the amp inducing toll and imd pathways in lepidopterans though not all components have been identified in model organisms such as m. sexta 32 35 . in general gram negative bacterial infections of d. melanogaster stimulate the proteolytic cleavage of relish through the imd pathway . overall nfb proteins and their dna binding specificities are conserved among organisms including those lepidoptera studied to date 73 74 . however the nfb binding regions for inhibitor of b ib proteins e.g. cactus are not conserved suggesting diversification and co adaptation between ib and nfb pairs . also recent work indicates that nfb nuclear co regulators may contribute to species specific regulation of amp gene expression . although the nomenclature quickly becomes confusing ctls include lipopolysaccharide binding protein lbp . m. sexta iml1 binds to gram positive and gram negative bacteria as well as yeast iml2 shows specific binding to lps iml3 and iml4 show specific binding to lps and lta and iml3 can also bind laminarin a 13glucan 103 104 . however specific representatives of each class are restricted to lepidoptera table 1 . for example the lepidopteran grp2 which binds fungal cell wall 13 glucans and lta is absent from diptera . in mamp dependent toll induction bacterial lys pgn typical of gram positive bacteria is detected by pgrp sa or pgrp sd in the presence of gnbp1 while yeast or fungal 13glucan is detected by gnbp3 85 108 109 figure 1 . both m. sexta and b. mori encode homologs of the d. melanogaster toll activating cytokine sptzle figure 2 . also for both m. sexta and b. mori there is experimental evidence linking the toll pathway with amp induction 116118 . in addition the transcript level of hemolin a pattern recognition protein exclusive to lepidopterans table 1 is induced by injection of activated sptzle c108 into larvae . also the genome of b. mori lacks 11 orthologs of grass spirit and persephone the d. melanogaster serine proteases responsible for mamp prr dependent and mamp independent cleavage of spe figure 1 . however the prrs and proteolytic cascade that transduce mamp signals to amp induction are unknown figure 1 . dap pgn pgrp lc interaction activates intracellular imd which then recruits fas associated death domain fadd and death related ced3nedd2like protein dredd to form a complex 129 130 . current evidence supports the idea that dredd a caspase like molecule cleaves the nfb transcription factor relish . both iap2 and tab2 act upstream of relish and downstream of imd while iap2 functions downstream of tak1 132 134 . genes encoding lysozyme moricin and defensin amps also were up regulated in the midgut of b. mori in the wandering stage consistent with the possibility that amp induction is imd mediated . finally in the lepidopteran beet armyworm spodoptera exigua rnai mediated knockdown of relish expression resulted in loss of cecropin induction upon fungal infection further strengthening the idea that the imd pathway may contribute to amp gene expression in lepidoptera though perhaps it is triggered by distinct signals .", "antiepileptic drug levels were within therapeutic range free phenytoin 1.3 g ml levetiracetam 5.9 g ml and lamotrigine 2.3 g ml . all started with a bout of cough when the

of igf2 protein was also significantly lower in the nt2 cells transfected with mir210 mimics than in control cells and knockdown of mir210 with mir210 inhibitor increased protein expression of igf2 figures 6 . also insulin igf plays an important role in the proper function of the testis in males .", "although the maternity care system for low risk pregnant women peculiar to one country can not easily be compared with those in other countries consumer demands for the humanization of obstetric care have arisen in various countries 18 . this is because in deliveries managed by independent midwives in japan many intervention measures such as oxytocin infusion epidural anesthesia episiotomy suture and instrumental delivery are not available based on japanese legal restrictions . in our institute one of the main tokyo city perinatal centers there are 3 japanese systems of midwife led delivery care as follows 1 those intending to give birth at home managed by midwives who do not belong to our hospital 2 those planning to give birth on futons i.e. the protocol for this analysis was approved by the ethics committee of the japanese red cross katsushika maternity hospital . in addition informed consent for analysis from a retrospective database was obtained from each subject during their hospital visit . a retrospective study was performed to examine trends in transfers and perinatal outcomes among labors that started using the 3 systems of midwife led primary delivery care . in this study student s t test was used for continuous variables and the test for categorical variables . differences with p between 2009 and 2012 a total of 678 low risk women were placed in the 3 forms of midwife led primary delivery care at the onset of labor pains andor rupture of membranes at 3741 weeks of gestation . in addition the timing of transfers in the system run by the midwives belonging to our hospital before the second stage of labor 52 was earlier than those in the other 2 systems 21 in the planned home birth or 4.12 95 ci 2.66.6 p 0.01 20 in planned hospital birth or 4.29 95 ci 2.57.4 p 0.01 . however if classified into nulliparous and parous women there were no significant differences in the rate of transfers among the 3 groups as shown in table 1 . during the period the main indications for transfers were maternal postpartum hemorrhage andor neonatal respiratory distress associated with asphyxia . fortunately the difference was not associated with adverse obstetric or neonatal outcomes however unfortunately they led to early mother to child separation especially in cases of planned home birth because healthy puerperal women or newborns can not be transferred from home to hospital according to japanese law . although home birth might be very comfortable those involved must be prepared for mother to child separation in cases of referrals after delivery . in addition there might be some bias related to the backgrounds in the selection of the systems because this was not a randomized trial study .", "diabetes decreases the overall life expectancy and cause a heavy burden on public health 1 . enpp1 also called k121q has a glutamine

on the reduction of lipid profiles and the prevention of future cardiac events . mhi and anw are divisions of allina health a large healthcare provider in minnesota and western wisconsin . a significant cardiovascular event was defined as a myocardial infarction mi a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ptca or stenting procedure or a coronary artery bypass graft cabg using ehr documented icd9 criteria . a value of p 0.05 was considered significant and p values are two sided where possible . all statistical calculations and plots were done with stata 11.2 college station tx . maximum ldl levels ranged from 211 to 448 mg dl with a mean sd value of 298 80.7 mg dl in the study group . all of the patients indicated that they were aware that they likely had fh and 7 patients indicated that their immediate family had been tested for fh . although taken from a small study population our data suggests a reduction in cardiac event rate after apheresis . these studies have been small primarily nonrandomized trials . another study found that out of 18 patients 3 had myocardial infarctions 1 underwent a cabg and 12 needed coronary angioplasties within two years of beginning a combination therapy of apheresis statins and probucol . additionally almost all patients were interested in learning more about alternative treatments suggesting that they would prefer an alternative treatment which could match the results provided by apheresis . by defining the observational period initial time point as the first documented ehr visit we excluded 20 events before apheresis and 2 events after apheresis from the cardiac event rate calculation . although lipid apheresis was performed every two weeks ldl values were not measured ever two weeks due to clinical practices . however there is a need for alternative treatments which are less invasive and provide easier patient access .", "agenesis of the inferior vena cava ivc as a cause of recurrent deep vein

details of data collection measurements and study procedures are available at httpwww.jhucct.comadaptmanall43.pdf and described elsewhere . in 2005 the roskamp institute initiated a proteomic ancillary study f. crawford pi involving blood draw from these subjects . a separate consent was also obtained from each subject who participated in the ancillary study . alternate forms were utilized annually for the hvlt r rbmt and bvmt r on each subsequent annual visit . a more comprehensive neuropsychological assessment was also administered by a neuropsychologist as part of the dementia work up . all mci patients were considered to be amnestic mci as they only had memory impairment but maintained normal activities of daily living and overall had a well preserved cognition in other cognitive domains . apoe genotypes were unavailable for 4 individuals but these were included in the analyses . although all subjects at enrollment performed within the normal limits based on the established cut off scores those that ultimately declined had generally poorer scores on the 3ms mmse and all memory measures . all neuropsychological analyses were adjusted for age gender and education but no adjustment for the study medications was required as these were baseline scores . cox regression analysis showed that a142 measured in the lowest two quartiles compared to the highest quartile was a significant individual predictor of conversion to mci ad in this model 2 log likelihood 197.47 38.41 df 15 p .001 . baseline values for the 3ms hvlt r and generative verbal fluency scores were subtracted from those obtained at the 12month repeat testing to determine if changes in these measures differ by a142 and a142a140 ratios . for a142a140 ratios a similar pattern was observed but this difference was not statistically significant . 0.14 0.33 sd respectively . a simple and pragmatic method for identifying older adults at an increased risk for mci ad who may benefit from targeted prevention is therefore of importance in reducing the burden of ad . furthermore sensitivity with specificity of at least 80 for the combined measures was superior to neuropsychological measures or to serum a levels alone . an association between serum a140 and cognitive measures of memory and language has also been reported in cognitively normal older adults .", "", " the wntcatenin

room temperature and sections were washed with tris buffered saline between incubations . blinded enumeration was performed under light microscopy at 400x magnification and an ocular grid consisting of a simple square lattice of 100 test points was utilized to count the number of positively and negatively stained melanomas or nevus cells for each section . a tumor was considered to be stained with high intensity if 50 of the cells in a specimen expressed rad6 or catenin similar to the criteria used by mineta et al . chi square tests for differences in proportions were used to compare groups on the basis of categorical variables such as gender and catenin localization . adjustments were made for multiple comparisons using wilcoxon rank sum tests with bonferroni correction for pairwise comparisons . median rad6 is greater in the group of people older than 60 years compared to the 5060 years old group p 0.04 and 50 years old group p 0.001 . a 20 discrepancy of positively

independent of its binding to the der p 1 enzyme active site fig . suppression of total ige p 0.04 and der p 1specific ige p 0.05 productions was also obtained when the proteolytic activity of der p 1 was blocked with iodoacetamide another sulfhydryl reactive agent . allergic individuals could potentially be achieved by administering der p 1 in a catalytically inactive mutant form . the in vivo relevance of the proteolytic activity of der p 1 is further highlighted by reports demonstrating that it increases the permeability of the human respiratory epithelium to macromolecules 1516 .", "a 47year old man who had undergone an l4l5 laminectomy and discectomy 5 years earlier presented with recurrent pain in the left buttock and posterior leg . after receiving an esi by a local anesthesiology group within the cincinnati ohio area the patient was transferred from the outpatient pain clinic to our institution . although the initial magnetic resonance imaging mri study performed in the emergency department was unremarkable fig . 2 . a nonvascular penetrating injection of contrast media verifies safe needle placement . . in 31 cadavers biglioli et al . examined the variability of the artery of adamkiewicz noting that it originated at l2 in 1 of cases and l4 in 0.075 of cases .", "", "alzheimer s disease ad is a neurodegenerative disorder that is clinically characterized by progressive mental decline and histopathologically defined by highly abundant amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain parenchyma . despite its strength the amyloid cascade hypothesis is incomplete without including the essential role of amyloid associated inflammatory proteins . however until inflammatory proteins such as act il1 hla and apoe were found to be overexpressed in ad and ds brains the term inflammation was explicitly excluded from the clinical and pathological description of ad because of the lack of edema and lymphocyte infiltration 911 17 18 . because of apoe s essential genetic and therefore presumably biochemical contribution to ad pathology and cognitive decline it is critical that its role in the ad pathogenic pathway amyloid cascade be elucidated in order for therapeutics based on apoe to be designed . indeed without one or the other of these amyloid catalysts expressed in the brain amyloid deposition is profoundly delayed in app transgenic mice and does not become filamentous . activation of lxr results in increased expression of many proteins including apoe and its lipidating enzyme atp binding cassette transporter a1 abca1 . because apoe expression and lipidation is stimulated by lxr activation the results were interpreted as proof that increased apoe levels help microglia clear a and amyloid as indeed some earlier cell culture experiments had suggested . if apoe is an amyloid catalyst then reducing apoe levels or function in the brain should result in reduced amyloid deposition and reduced cognitive decline . all experiments carried out so far in vitro or in transgenic mice indicate that the ability of a to form neurotoxic filaments or oligomers and cause cognitive decline are increased in the presence of apoe particularly mouse apoe and human apoe4 with apoe2 being protective . even though the key predictions of the polymerization hypothesis that is apoe serving as an a filament catalyst have been borne out the compelling experiments demonstrating that human apoe inhibits filament formation in a mouse background require explanation . however an important feature of any catalyst is that it must bind its substrate only tightly enough to convert it to the transition state structure and then release it as the reaction is completed 65 66 . because apoe clearly has the ability to catalyze the conversion of a into oligomeric and polymeric structures it is reasonable to assume that those structures will be more difficult to clear and that such difficulty will be detected as clearance inhibition in the brain for instance by apoe4 in pulse chase type experiments while the higher apoe levels in blood may aid the clearance of a from the circulations figure 1 . a good test of any hypothesis about the pathogenesis of a disease is whether it successfully predicts how the pathogenesis can be inhibited or reversed . this early in vitro work has recently been repeated and confirmed in other laboratories 72 73 . furthermore the inflammatory cytokine il1 that is overexpressed in ad brain induces astrocyte expression of act and blocking il1 expression in app transgenic mice by ibuprofen treatment thereby reducing mouse act expression lowers amyloid formation and restores cognition . apolipoprotein j also binds a and can be shown to aid its passage across the blood brain barrier 7983 . 6e10 inhibits act catalyzed polymerization of a while 13 m inhibits act catalysis much less and even promotes some polymerization itself . a possible explanation for this result is that the antibody functions by blocking a interaction with mouse act . other abinding proteins may be similarly manipulated by a decoy approach to reduce oligomerization and polymerization of a into neurotoxic species . however the finding that different antibodies to a can both inhibit act catalyzed a polymerization and promote polymerization of a itself argues that immunotherapy must be approached with care to avoid the use or induction of antibodies that can catalyze further oligo polymerization of a instead of inducing its phagocytosis and removal . finally the ability of a oligomers to inhibit key microtubule motors and prevent the transport of neurotrophin neurotransmitter and other receptors to the cell surface may underlie their neuronal toxicity .", "fractures are frequent in the elderly and result mainly from the effects of falls and osteoporosis . a value less than 2.5 times the sd below the young adult mean is considered to indicate osteoporosis . after one episode the risk of subsequent vertebral fracture increases at least four fold with substantially increased rates during the first year . ankylosis may be related to ankylosing spondylitis and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis which especially affect males and they have an estimated frequency of 5 to 15 in the elderly.2225 these ankylosed spines become increasingly susceptible to injury even in the event of low energy impacts and are prone to unstable vertebral fractures with an increased frequency of neurological complications either primary or secondary after unprotected transfers and manipulation . all the images should be carefully analyzed as multiple insufficiency fractures are frequent figure 5 . although the joints of the hand are the most commonly affected they are less likely to be symptomatic than the knee or hip figure 7 . direct signs of oa and indirect signs of large rotator cuff tears can be seen on plain films including superior humeral head migration and remodeling of the acromion and the greater tuberosity . although the intervertebral disks are not synovial joints the pathological changes are similar to those seen in the articular cartilage . ct and mri are routinely used for the evaluation of narrowing of the central canal lateral recesses and neural foramina when such an assessment is required percutaneous or surgical treatment . calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease demonstrated by deposits of microcrystals in the menisci arrow articular cartilage arrowhead and periarticular soft tissue curved arrow . another peculiarity of the elderly uncommon in adults is acute hematogenous osteomyelitis that mainly affects the spine . as regards imaging techniques magnetic resonance imaging is the modality of choice for musculoskeletal infection as it best delineates the extension of soft tissue infections . a on conventional radiography there is mild osteoporosis extensive soft tissue swelling and large marginal erosion arrowhead b on doppler ultrasound the synovitis arrows and bone erosion arrowhead are well depicted . as a result secondary osteoarthritis insufficiency fractures bowing of the bones and even spinal cord or nerve root compression can be observed . paget s disease affecting the iliac bone demonstrated with coarsening of the bone trabeculae and cortical thickening arrows . although they are often multiple a solitary metastasis is still more common than a primary neoplasm . even with the advances in mri especially for bone marrow screening bone scintigraphy continues to be used as an effective method for initial evaluation of the whole body for bone metastases . besides a better understanding of musculoskeletal diseases can lead to the implementation of effective preventive measures thus reducing public health expenditure and improving the quality of life in the elderly .", "among migraineurs defining risk factors for cm or for the progression of episodic migraine to cm identified risk factors include medication overuse obesity sleep problems and psychiatric comorbidity 712 . furthermore differences in methods of studies based in community or tertiary centers prevent appropriate comparison . community data were gathered in capela nova a city from the state of minas gerais brazil . according to the 2000 brazilian census its population was 2066 inhabitants 1631 over the age of 10 years . activities provided by family health care teams take place at primary care facilities in patients homes and in the community . in the first phase of our study screening phase trained community health workers screened for the occurrence of headaches using the following question have you had any headache episode over the last 12 months those who screened positive were asked about headache frequency in the past month and those reporting 15 days or more of headache were offered in person assessment by neurologists with expertise in headache medicine . this center is located in belo horizonte and is the only headache clinic in the state of minas gerais brazil . the study followed the guidance of the regulatory norms of the brazilian national health council resolution 1961996 which is in accordance with the helsinki declaration . the protocol and all forms were reviewed and approved by the local ethics research committee . data were transferred to epi info 2000 by a study coordinator and analyzed using spss 12.0 . discrete data were compared between groups using the chi square test or the fisher test when anticipated values were small . 43 75.4 had cm and 41 consented to being assessed by the psychiatrist 95.3 participation rate . bipolar disorder was not seen in the community and was diagnosed in two cases from the headache center . one limitation of these studies was the use of self report questionnaires rather than clinical interview in ascertaining psychiatric diagnosis . a similar rate was described in the american migraine prevalence and prevention ampp study a population based survey based on mailed questionnaires . in that study depression was assessed by self report of a physician diagnosis and by the patient health questionnaire phq9depression module . for bipolar disorder type 2 we failed to detect this association likely because of small size of the samples . demographic profiles were similar in both groups and the vast majority of individuals with cm were women .", "being an endogenous constituent of human and rodent genomes m1dg is mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cells and leads to mispairing when

mice were tail bled and direct and competitive elisa analyses of the sera were performed figure 2 step 1 . splenocytes from a single mouse balb cj r were fused with myeloma cells plated on twenty four 96well plates and screened using direct and competitive elisa analyses step 2 . from this screen five parental cell lines were chosen for subcloning and further screening step 4 . 6oxo m1dg antibodies are present in the serum of mouse balb cj r. the serum of mouse balb cj r was subjected to competitive elisa analysis with 6oxo m1dg used as the competitor . the displayed results represent the average of spectroscopic readings at 15 and 30 min postaddition of abts substrate . elisa analysis revealed that of the 1670 hybridomas 180 showed production of anti6oxo m1dg antibodies . for subclone e2 xanthine has a similar effect demonstrating that e2 s mab are not specific to 6oxo m1dg . however xanthine has no effect on the optical density of subclone b supernatant suggesting that mab from subclone b are specific to 6oxo m1dg . on the basis of these data subclone b was subjected to further subcloning but e2 was not . the amount detected accuracy and recovery values are shown as the mean s.d . a major contributor to the low levels of m1dg is its oxidative metabolism to 6oxo m1dg . although there was minimal cross reactivity of the antibody with individual members of a panel of exocyclic adducts and purine oxidation products figures 1 and 5 it is possible that high levels of low avidity nucleosides in urine and feces compete with the low levels of endogenous 6oxo m1dg for binding sites on the mab . 6oxo m1dg was detected in the feces of each of three different sprague dawley rats but was detected in the urine of only one of the rats table 2 . base propenal formation is triggered by abstraction of the hydrogen from the c4 position of the deoxyribosyl unit of double stranded dna . furthermore m1dg formation as a reaction of base propenals and free deoxyguanosine is a bimolecular process . it was not possible to control for this possibility under the reported experimental regime so future studies with animals fed nucleic acid free diets will be required to test this hypothesis . given that the analytical method described herein is applicable to feces and urine the possibility exists for preclinical or clinical studies conducted in a noninvasive fashion .",

the patient . abasbassi et al showed a lower ih formation rate with no division of the mesentery but also no closure of the mesentery . in 679 patients with an antecolic roux limb the majority of all the defects closed . as demonstrated here the published papers on the subject have reported a wide range of ih incidence from 0 to 15.5 . another complicating factor may be that many of the papers published in this area are from surgical programs training fellows and the association of postsurgical complications with performance of operations by fellows is not known . also the incidence of sbo caused by adhesions is higher in the current study than in some others . a hand sewn technique could be used to close the common enterotomy and might reduce the incidence of sbo slightly but the cut end of the biliopancreatic limb still has an exposed staple line . however its strength is also its chief weakness as the results may not be reproducible by others . although only the years of 2011 through 2013 were examined and the average time to sbo was 8.1 months it is possible that the sbo rate will climb in these same patients as time passes and some of the patients are likely to be lost

biallelic mutations detected in all independent transgenic lines examined zhou et al . 2015 . for woody perennials such as forest trees fruit nut trees and woody ornamentals with highly heterologous genomes and long generation times crispr cas9 affords a facile means to accelerate genetic improvement . consistent with this prediction lignin content was reduced by 23 with a concomitant decrease of s g lignin ratio by 30 in all transgenic plants zhou et al . for example antisense downregulation of 4cl1 in populus resulted in patchy wood discoloration in only 5 of 14 transgenic lines voelker et

modification as off target cleavage due to non specific crispr cas9 activity may cause unintended mutations . this is especially true for plant genomes that are characterized by recurring episodes of

crispr cas9 genome editing probably because the common plant models such as arabidopsis rice soybean and tomato are selfing species with homozygous genomes . a recent population genomics study of 544 populus trichocarpa individuals identified 17.9 million m snps by whole genome resequencing evans et al . given the high levels of heterozygosity in tree species the need to consider sequence polymorphisms in genome editing experiments can not be over emphasized . and crispr p lei et al . 2014 their utility for outcrossing species is limited because the preloaded genome sequences lack biallelic or multiploid coverage . p. tremula x alba 717 . from the first analysis we found that more than 57 of the grnas designed based on the p. trichocarpa genome correspond to regions that harbor snps or indels in 717 xue et al . in the absence of deep sequencing data pcr primers with or without degeneracy can be designed to amplify the target gene coding region based on a closely related reference genome or on conserved amino acid sequences of orthologs as in conventional rt pcr cloning hu et al . 1998 . as pam nggthe only sequence constraint in grna design occurs frequently it is not necessary to obtain full length gene sequences . direct sequencing of pcr products to identify sequence variants is an established practice in molecular ecology research and several programs have been

based data analysis . 2 . 2015 are expected to facilitate this effort . as depicted in figure 2 primary transformants with confirmed editing can be used directly for in depth characterization when multiple independent events are available as biological replicates zhou et al . a for gene silencing by antisense sense or rnai approaches knowledge about the spatiotemporal expression pattern of the target gene is used to select an appropriate promoter for construct preparation . expression knowledge is not necessary for crispr cas9 editing at the dna level and vectors with a pol iii promoter e.g. 35s promoter are widely applicable . b following regeneration of putative transgenic plants conventional screening involves pcr confirmation of transgenes followed by expression analysis to select events with desired or maximum levels of gene suppression . it is common to screen a large number of events 10 to identify a minimum of 3 for subsequent analysis . this process can be greatly simplified with crispr cas9 mutants as dna level analysis by amplicon sequencing can identify events with biallelic mutations for further analysis . c for species with a robust transformation system multiple biallelic crispr cas9 events can be used directly as biological replicates for in depth characterization . in case of difficult to transform species for which few biallelic events may be obtained micropropagation is necessary to obtain biological replicates before in depth characterization as is typically done using gene silencing . 2014 another concern for outcrossing species is that the progenies will be different from the parents which necessitates additional screening and selection . a well known tree example is the loblolly pine pinus taeda clone 756 that harbors a naturally occurring null allele of cinnamoyl alcohol dehydrogenase involved in lignin biosynthesis and that is extensively used as a parent in several breeding programs in the us gill et al . another example is early flowering ft plum that serves as a parent in the fasttrack breeding program to expedite development of improved commercial cultivars callahan et al . clearly development of innovative methods

the calculated compositions on the right hand side tend to have a smaller error bar on account of the signal noise ratio being higher for larger particles . a comparison of raw edx spectra extracted from fept bimetallic seed particles and from pure fe3o4 particles with ic0 and ic1 respectively is provided in figure 6 . given that the resolution of our edx detector is approximately 130 ev at mn k and that there were no overlapping x ray lines in our case the increase in the number of counts per channel and hence in the accuracy of the analysis comes without significant resolution loss and therefore should not have any adverse effect in the analysis . a blind source separation method based on pca and ica has been applied to the analysis of edx spectrum images of core the analysis has accurately determined the number of phases in the analyzed volume core shell and supporting film as well as their spectra and distribution maps .", "ca binding proteins such as calmodulin play a pivotal role in ca signal transmission and amplification . consistent with this notion camkii null mice present with impaired memory formation and camkii is essential for genesis and maintenance of ltp in postsynaptic neurons . camkii also participates in glucose stimulated insulin secretion gsis as multiple insulin secretagogues increase camkii activity . all groups were then maintained at 3 mm glucose for a 24h consolidation period . for perifusion assays 150 treated human islets were placed into a perifusion chamber millipore billerica ma usa . a computer controlled fast performance hplc system allowed programmable rates of flow and concentrations of the appropriate solutions held in a 37 c water bath . at the end of each experiment islets were tested for maximal insulin secretion by adding 30 mm kcl to the perifusate . statistical analyses were performed using student s t test or a two way anova with a bonferroni s posttest as required . as detailed below we established that exposure of cultured min6 cells to four 1h pulses of high glucose interspersed with 7h intervals of low glucose and thus mimicking postprandial glucose spikes in vivo were able to elicit robust metabolic memory . the detailed experimental paradigm is outlined in figure 1a . as shown in figure 1b min6 cells exposed to the glucose pulse regimen showed higher insulin secretion both when exposed to low 2.8 mm or high 16.8 mm glucose than cells which had been cultured continuously at low glucose . as was the case in min6 cells the pulse group showed increased camkii phosphorylation at both basal and stimulatory glucose concentrations figure 2b . as before these effects were abolished by the camkii inhibitor kn93 figure 2a d . as shown in figure 3e depolarization by potassium chloride during the acquisition period produced similar if somewhat lower increases in pcamkii and psynapsin levels 24 h after the last kcl pulse . cerasi and colleagues had previously reported time dependent potentiation of insulin secretion in that exposure of rat islets to high glucose 27.7 mm up to 60 min prior to the test stimulation with glucose increased subsequent insulin secretion . given the pivotal role of altered insulin secretion in metabolic disorders future work will need to establish to what extent metabolic memory of pancreatic cells contributes to the pathophysiology of these diseases .", "for example it is a matter of debate whether as the world s population lives longer and ages they will be unhealthy and pose a greater burden on health systems . aging according to a recent organization for economic cooperation and development oecd 2001 report is the principal factor currently driving pension spending costs . countries have long reported causes of death or mortality statistics based on who s 1992 international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems icd10 . a considerable academic literature built up around clinical and other uses of the icidh but much of this literature was critical of the underlying model of disability . after presentation before the executive board in december 2000 the classification was put on the agenda of the fifty fourth world health assembly and renamed the icf . a health condition may also include other circumstances such as pregnancy aging stress congenital anomaly or genetic predisposition . domains are a practical meaningful set of related physiological functions anatomical structures actions tasks or areas of life . because the current environment always incorporates the overall social context performance might be understood as involvement in the lived experience of disability . for measurement purposes this level of capacity presumes a standardized assessment environment namely one that reveals the inherent capacity of a person in a specific functional domain without any particular enhancements . 2002 . a set of operational rules will specify the procedure

example in the hiv positive group the nulliparous and parous women are closer in age than in the false positive group . found that the ppv of the oraquick test was 90 while the ppv of the eia was 74 12 13 . a woman testing preliminarily positive for hiv in labor should be counseled that she may have hiv infection and that her neonate may be exposed and immediate antiretroviral prophylaxis should be recommended without waiting for confirmatory test results . a potential reason for this cross reactivity is that there are similarities in homology between the transmembrane domains of the influenza envelope protein hemagglutinin and the hiv1 envelope proteins .", " childhood obesity is a serious and growing public health problem that has arisen over the past three decades . gas6 expression is widespread in many tissues including immune cells endothelial cells vascular smooth muscle cells and adipocytes 79 . experiments with mice fed a high fat diet indicated that

treatment during fertility treatment . positive correlation between the level of depression and anxiety and other dimensions of experiences during infertility treatment might be accompanied with social impairment thus affecting the levels of depression and anxiety . this by itself could increase the level of anxiety among women when treatment starts . although this research did not evaluate mental health before and after the beginning of gnrh agonists but this might explain women s psychological disorders before ovulation stimulation regarding high frequency of mental disorders at the

opposite directions . a plot of the and dihedrals for a perfectly correlated negative ht will have a slope of 1 . a nonzero intercept along the or axis see for example figure 4 or and dihedrals centered in quadrant ii 0 0 or quadrant iv 0 0 see for example figure 8 are indications of a cavity that is not complementary with a planar chromophore . the change from forms a to i is solely a protonation change while the change from i to b is a conformational change with most changes occurring at thr203 . following radiative relaxation from the excited state intermediate i the systems returns to the ground state a through the ground state intermediates i1 and i2.29 excitation of the anionic b state results in direct emission from the excited state b at 482 nm . dronpa mtfp0.7 kfp1 . a cistrans isomerization of the chromophore has been proposed as the structural basis for the photoswitching observed in dronpa.47 this is supported by the fact that mutating either val157 or met159 with smaller residues accelerates photoswitching presumably by decreasing steric hindrance to cistrans isomerization.48 the m159 t and v157 g mutations also decrease the quantum yield of dronpa from 0.85 to quantum yields of 0.23 and 0.77 respectively.48 recently it has been suggested that adoption of a trans configuration can not solely be responsible for the nonfluorescent form.49 on the basis of nmr analyses miyawaki et al . in pyp the asymmetric proteinchromophore interaction probably serves as the initial accelerant for the light induced photocycle50 which ultimately leads to a cistrans isomerization.51 the chromophore in wild type gfp is planar due its extended system see figure 1 however the energy barrier to deformation is low and the protein matrix in wild type gfp exerts some strain away from planarity . the opls2005 force field of macromodel v9.001660 was used . the area of the convex hull of the and graphs was calculated as was the smallest convex set containing the region . as shown in figure 2 gfp adopts two states the neutral state a of the chromophore with the phenolic oxygen protonated and the anionic species b the change from forms a to i is solely a protonation change while the change from i to b is a conformational change with most changes occurring at thr203.67 in order to see whether the gfp chromophore has different dihedral freedom in forms a b and i we conducted molecular dynamical simulations with a freely rotating chromophore as described in the . not surprisingly table 1 and figure 4 show that forms a b and i of gfp have similar dihedral freedom and that all undergo similar negatively correlated same slopes of best fit lines in figure 4 hula twists . however there are subtle differences forms a and i are closer to the planar ground state conformation while the b form adopts conformations further from planarity when given rotational freedom around the and dihedrals intercept further from 0 and the anionic b form has the most freedom largest area and and range while the neutral a form has the least freedom . figure 5 and table 1 show that the chromophore in bfp has significantly more rotational freedom than that available to the chromophore in gfp and that the bfp cavity is less complementary to a planar chromophore than the gfp cavity is that is the bfp sampled structures are further from a planar chromophore 0 and the intercept for the best fit line through the bfp structures is further from the origin than that of gfp . analysis of the 2000 bfp structures revealed a hydrogen bond between the nh of the his66 imidazole ring and glu222 which is retained through out the entire simulation see figure 7 . recently two new blue fluorescent proteins azurite and a5 with enhanced brightness and photostability were created . in order to find a starting conformation for the md simulation the 2emd crystal structure was graphically mutated to a5 and a thorough conformational search was undertaken see . given the high structural similarity between all the solid state structures of gfp mutants in the protein databank a thorough conformational search should find the lowest energy conformations of a5 by making the relevant mutations to the 2emd structure . for a5 median 2.92 median 2.22 and intercept of best fit line is 4.62 vs for bfp median 27.59 median 10.18 and intercept of best fit line 14.27 . in contrast to 2emd there are no hydrogen bonding interactions with the n hydrogen see figure 7 . 73 the resultant mutant yfp is red shifted by 16 nm relative to gfp s65 t and does indeed have a stacking interaction between the chromophore and tyr203.74 on the basis of the crystal structure of yfp remington et al . in quadrant iv 0 and 0 . it has 5551 structures with two phenol rings in separate molecules that have centroids within 5.00 of each other . the closest ones are 3.16 from each other and only 832 structures are within 3.75 i.e. the average distance between the phenol centroids in the freely rotating yfp . a plot of the distance vs the angle between the phenol planes in our freely rotating simulation and the csd structures shows that the protein matrix of yfp restricts the distance between tyr66 and tyr203 from being larger than 4.18 but that the angles between the two phenols have as much freedom in yfp as in the small molecule structures with intermolecular distances of less than 4.18 see figure 9 . have suggested that coplanarity might be more important than isomer configuration in determining the efficiency of fluorescence . our calculations show that this is the case for the systems examined .", "at our institution we employ histogel for this purpose . especially in this setting a negative mutation result can be either due to the true absence of the mutation in the tumor cells or insufficient percent tumor cellularity that falls below the analytic sensitivity threshold thereby resulting in the failure to detect the mutation even despite the presence of the mutation . sanger sequencing is also relatively more labor intensive and time consuming than targeted methods and can lead to longer turnaround times . in contrast to the general sanger sequencing approach targeted mutation detection methods such as pcr restriction fragment length polymorphism real time pcr pyrosequencing high resolution melting analysis hrma and pcr fragment analysis can be utilized . 2 . as mentioned previously ffpe cell blocks represent the traditional cytopreparatory platform on which ancillary molecular diagnostic tests are performed . accordingly the average yield of dna extracted from direct smears was significantly higher than that from thinprep slides . as the l858r substitution and deletions in exon 19 represent approximately 90 of all egfr mutations in lung adenocarcinoma one antibody is specific for the exon 21 l858r mutation and the other specific for the 15base pair5amino acid deletion e746a750del in exon

these cancers . alk gene loci that have not undergone rearrangement typically display fused orange and green signals yellow or juxtaposed touching orange and green signals . 3 a nucleus can also be scored positive if a single orange signal without a corresponding green signal is observed . as mentioned previously paraffin embedded cell blocks are processed similarly to paraffin embedded tissue blocks thus cell blocks are traditionally used for the performance of alk rearrangement fish assays . . emerging molecular technological advances such as next generation sequencing ngs that allow for high throughput high sensitivity molecular analyses will likely play an important role in the management of patients with nsclc .", "the seer registry data collection began in the early 1970s and

probiotics is derived from a greek word meaning for life and holds the opposite meaning from antibiotics which means against life. although the role of capsaicin in carcinogenic processes has been controversial there is accumulated evidence that capsaicin is capable to induce apoptosis of cancer cells by generating excess reactive oxygen species.23 thoennissen et al.24 demonstrated that capsaicin caused cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in breast cancer cells by modulating the egfr her2 pathway and inhibited the development of pre neoplastic breast lesions by up to 80 without toxicity . animals provided kimchi extract showed in smaller tumor weight and decreased malondialdehyde formation compared to those of the control group.27 although there has been no general acceptance on how to define probiotic microorganisms lactobacillus species bifidobacterium sp saccharomyces boulardii and some other microbes have been thought and used as probiotic strains.28 these probiotic microorganisms have been used as food supplement in order to achieve health benefit effects of them . it is a gram positive and catalase negative bacteria included in geneally recognized as safe.30 the main lactic acid bacteria involved in kimchi fermentation has long been known as lactobacillus genus and leuconostoc genus but more recently weissella genus lactic acid bacteria has been newly separately identified.30 weissella is an early dominant in kimchi fermentation and produces lactic acid acetic acid alcohol dextran and co2 which account for the unique fresh taste and texture of kimchi.3132 weissella species found in kimchi are w. cibaria w. koreensis and w. hanii.12 sources of each weissella species are shown in table 1.33 w. cibaria newly named by bjorkroth and others has been separated from korean kimchi and various other sources including fermented foods greek salami spanish sausages and animal and human excrements . among these lactic acid bacteria w. cibaria exhibited higher production of eps which indicates more acid resistance table 2.37 w. cibaria was reported to have anticancer activity immune modulating activity anti inflammatory activity and antioxidant activity . based on the patent related to the w. cibaria s anticancer activity registered by cha et al.38 the anticancer activity in w. cibaria w. cibaria bacteria was incubated for 24 hours in deman rogosa sharpe agar badge diluted with phosphate buffered saline and 10 concentration of bacteria samples were provided to normal cell strains and colorectal cancer cell strains for 72 hours . ahn et al.33 presented that the immune control effect of w. cibaria was stronger than the well known probiotic bacterium l. rhammosus gg lgg . furthermore w. cibaria is known to have an antiviral function against the avian influenza virus.39 ornithine a type of amino acid produced from its arginine precursor is reported to accelerate growth hormone excretion and has an antiobesity effect . during the kimchi fermentation process the level of arginine an ornithine precursor has decreased while the ornithine level increased rapidly which suggested that kimchi is a source of ornithine . this bacterium is not only widely dispersed in nature but is also found in human oral cavity and digestive organs . acid tolerance of l. plantarum allows us to use this bacterium for natural antibacterial and antifungal products . l. plantarum s cancer preventive potential has been tested by the ames mutation assay and the sos chromotest . when cabbage was brined with 3 salt concentration and kimchi was fermented at 5c for 3 weeks kimchi extract exerted an antimutagenic effect against aflatoxin b1.44 l. plantarum isolated from kimchi also exhibited a strong antimutagenic effect against n methyl nnitro n nitrosoguanidine 4nitroquinoline1oxide.45 furthermore l. plantarum isolated from kimchi had stronger antimutagenic effects compared to lactic acid bacteria originated from fermented milk.46 the macrophagocytes provided with l. plantarum separated from kimchi strengthened phagocytosis and displayed anticancer effects in aseites carcinoma and solid tumor due to the polysaccharide chains of muramic acid in the l. plantarum s cell well . among lactic acid bacteria s cell wall substances polysaccharide types rather than glycopeptide play a pivotal role in cancer

promising to control potentially malignant oral lesions reviewed in 13 . however long term survival rates especially for advanced hnc have not improved significantly over the last decades . as nrs modulate cell proliferation apoptosis invasion and migration clearly representing hallmarks of cancer cells several highly successful cancer drugs target this receptor family 811 . beside their proven clinical relevance for hormone regulated malignancies there is rather limited information on their pathophysiological role as well as their prognostic and therapeutic potential for head and neck cancer 7 8 12 2022 . as such ppar is overexpressed in many epithelial malignancies 22 28 29 including oral squamous cell carcinoma . in the absence of ligand ppars are complexed with corepressor proteins thus acting as transcriptional repressors . clinical aspects of peroxisome proliferator activated receptors in hnsccin hnscc overexpression on the protein level has been convincingly demonstrated for ppar and ppar 12 30 33 . agonist binding to ppar can induce cell differentiation growth arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells . additionally such activating ppar ligands were shown to exert antiproliferative on human colon and breast cancers details in 23 24 and were also suggested as potential chemopreventive agents for oral carcinogenesis 12 35 36 . moreover the results of several studies indicated that the growth inhibiting activity of ppar ligands in oscc may be ppar independent . others showed that the observed effects were strongly dependent on pparexpression 12 38 as well as on the type and concentration of the agonist . in the majority of oscc cases ppar mrna could be detected by rt pcr . also hypoxia induced angiogenesis appears to be affected by ppar ligands in cancer therapy even if the precise mechanisms still remain unclear . increasing knowledge about the mode of action specificity and dosage dependence of ppar agonistic and antagonistic ligands will hopefully allow a better modeling of ppar receptor function and thus lead to a more effective design of combinatorial application schemes for cancer treatment and cancer prevention in the future . another group of thyroid hormone receptor like receptors implicated in hnscc is the retinoid acid receptors rars . rars are characterized by their activation via vitamin a derivatives . could also show that the channeling of ra between these two nuclear receptor heterodimers is mediated by the cytoplasmic ra transporters crabp2 and fabp5 and thus is strongly depending on the fabp5crabp2 ratio . an additional way of biological regulation is epigenetic modulation playing an important role in cancer development reviewed in . gene silencing caused by aberrant hypermethylation of cpg islands has not only been detected in promoter regions of several tumor suppressor genes but several studies show hypermethylation of the rar promoter in colon breast and lung cancers 54 55 . also certain retinoids inhibited the development of second primary tumors in patients who had been previously treated for an early stage cancer but remained at high risk to relapse 26 60 and references within . however other studies using isotretinoin or other retinoids e.g. thus most of the studies demonstrating rar downregulation were based on in situ hybridization and could therefore only show a decrease in the amount of mrna . additionally there is evidence that retinoic acid induces the expression of rar mrna in certain cell lines but not in the malignant counterparts of these cells . current trials table 2 are therefore aiming to resolve these controversies by recruiting appropriate study populations as well as by the use of novel drugs and improved treatment protocols . besides the estrogen receptors themselves many of the genes regulated by the er estrogen axis are critical for cell proliferation inhibition of apoptosis stimulation of invasion and metastasis as well as for the promotion of angiogenesis see 10 11 and references within . sex hormone receptors are expressed not only in sexual organs but amongst others also in the vascular epithelium the lung epithelium and the larynx . clinical aspects of estrogen receptors in hnsccconsidering the impressive benefit of endocrine therapy in breast cancer targeting sex steroid hormone receptor as a potential therapeutic strategy is also discussed for hnscc 12 75 . currently two main strategies are pursued in endocrine therapy of er positive tumors . one is based on steroidal antiestrogens like tamoxifen which bind to the er block its function and ultimately induce receptor degradation 8 11 . also target genes activated by these nr subfamilies table 3 have been implicated as key elements in the molecular circuits involved in head and neck cancer development and progression . cancer s achilles heel it may be conceivable to speculate that molecules present in diet tobacco or beetle nut might deregulate the cell s

data from the u.k . groups that will be the targets for prevention efforts can be identified through several reasonably effective strategies . in practice we can identify people at high risk with simple and cost efficient tools . it is not clear how much antidiabetic drugs can help in preventing progression from ifg or igt to overt diabetes and what is their overall costs and risk benefit ratio in the long term . 33 in their analysis stress that the real answer to reductions in incidence and prevalence of diabetes is in social policy not in medical care .", "the study was approved by the bioethics committee of the department of odontology and surgery of university of bari . 10 samples of capsular and pericapsular soft tissues with the disk were obtained from healthy patients six men and four women with a mean age of 39 years who suffered surgery of tmj because of accidental trauma of the temporo mandibular region the remaining 7 cases four men and three women with a mean age of 57 years were patients surgically treated for severe degenerative lesions of tmj chronic arthritis and arthrosis . all specimens were immediately fixed in neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin 5 micron thick sections were cut and stained with haematoxylin eosin pas gomori s reticulin and azan mallory trichrome consecutive sections were used for the immunohistochemical detection of

neuron specific enolase nse synaptophysin s100 protein s100 and from becton dickinson burlingame usa leu7 . furthermore chondrocytes of healthy individuals appeared round shaped with distinct cell borders and central nuclei with an evident s100 reactivity both in nucleus and in cytoplasm . few studies are reported in literature on the precise identification and distribution of nrec in articular and peri articular tissues of tmj . free nervous endings immunohistochemically positive for neurofilaments nse and s100 protein have been detected only in periarticular soft tissues higher density in muscles and in the vascular venous plexus in the posterior part of discal ligaments and in the trilaminar zone and not in cartilagineous disk . in no instances this cellular component and their prolongments in cartilagineous disks showed neurofilaments nse or synaptophysin immunoreactivity . although immunochemistry can be easily used to study distribution and location of nrec in articular tissues we also suggest that ultrastuctural and immuno ultrastructural studies should be performed in order to definitely assess if chondrocytes is the exclusive cell type of articular cartilage or if also nrec could be present in tmj .", "a glance on statistics reveals that mental disorders and abnormalities are affecting the humans at an increasing pace . noorbala et al . based on a study on the association between mental health and educational stressors in nursing students of kerman nursing school in 2011 an increase in the number of students referrals to counseling centers shows their social and cultural growth on one hand as asking help is believed to be a sign for mental growth but on the other hand it reveals the disturbing factors decreasing students academic performance . each question had four options with scores ranging from 0 to 3 never 0 normal 1 almost more than normal 2 and actually more than normal 3 . an education booklet and a cd were prepared from valid references prior to each educational session and distributed among the attendants . data were analyzed by descriptive absolute and relative distribution table mean and sd and inferential paired t test statistical tests . about 57.7 of the subjects were nursing students and 42.35 were midwifery students 80.8 were single and 19.2 were married 78.8 were born in tehran and 21.2 in other cities 19.2 consumed psychotropic medications and 13.5 had a history of referring to a psychiatrist and 30.8 smoked in their leisure time . a reduction of mean score observed in all dimensions after education shows the positive effect of nlp education . after nlp education the anxiety in nursing group was less than in midwifery group revealing the effect of nlp education on the nursing group . it was also lower among the students who were not interested in their course of study compared to those who were . mental health among the students experiencing a disastrous event in the past 6 months or consuming psychotropic medication cigarettes or alcohol was lower than that of others . comparison of pre test post test mean scores of students mental health showed no significant difference in the

that compared to those with a low intake of dairy foods those who had a diet of high dairy intake had a lower fat accumulation . argued that there is an intricate association between obesity and dairy products intake concluding that for the children of higher age there was an inverse association between the intake of dairy foods and obesity . although the observed differences were not statistically significant eating whole fat dairy products was inversely associated with homa ir . due to the adverse health effects of this condition its high prevalence in the society as well as the shortage of

milrinone treatment for 3 days at the seoul national university children s hospital from january 2005 to december 2012 . in total 2299 eligible admissions were identified during the study period . accordingly the most common type of surgery was closure of the ventricular septal defect followed by repair of tetralogy of fallot and coarctoplasty . although diverse arrhythmias occurred in 75 10.3 admissions only 3 0.4 required reduction or discontinuation of milrinone infusion to alleviate arrhythmia . based on univariate logistic regression analysis of group a data the following parameters were associated with the development of arrhythmia male gender age 3 months and cardiopulmonary bypass time 180 minutes . although the korean national insurance covers only 35 hours of milrinone use we found that milrinone was frequently prescribed for a longer duration in actual settings suggesting a significant off label use . furthermore only 3 0.4 of the 715 admissions in group a experienced hypotension that required a reduction in milrinone infusion rate . cardiopulmonary bypass is known to be associated with thrombocytopenia that results from hemodilution and mechanical disruption.27 in the present study patients who developed thrombocytopenia had a longer cardiopulmonary bypass time and aorta clamping time .", "brown squard syndrome bss which occurs due to dysfunction of the

dose prednisone . in contrast 1123 and 2128 patients in the is oscost and is oscost groups were using systemic corticosteroids alone or in combination with an immunosuppressant . changes of the outer retina and rpe in late stage vkh patients including thickening of the rpe layer disruption or loss of the cost line and is os junction and thinning of the onl were clearly demonstrated by sd oct . better oct findings correlated to better vision prompt treatment at disease onset and less incidence of systemic corticosteroids andor immunosuppressant at 12 months after onset . clinical findings of late vkh patients vary greatly . all eyes displaying intact cost lines displayed normal is os junctions or rpe layers whereas those displaying intact is os junctions or normal rpe layers displayed disrupted cost lines . a former paper reported a similar correlation in patients with macular holes 12 20 . in accordance with yokota s report of a higher cone density in eyes displaying intact cost lines than in eyes displaying disrupted cost lines our finding supported fujita and itoh s theory that the recovery of the cost line but not the is os junction suggests enhanced restoration of the photoreceptors 11 12 . a relatively large sample size was achieved by using sophisticated statistics like mixed linear model and others .", "a common observation when complex proteomes are analyzed is that the lists of proteins identified are often quite variable which has raised concerns about the general value of proteomics for most applications if it actually does have poor reproducibility . cell lysates were prepared using 800 l of lysis buffer 25 mm tris ph 8.0 8 m urea 2 m thiourea 4 chaps 1 mm dtt per cell pellet collected from a 15cm tissue culture dish . cell lysates 1.5 mg were

3.0 and 12 showed only trace amount of proteins as few proteins have pi s near these values . after staining the gel with colloidal coomassie the 40mm lane was divided into 20 equal fractions and digested with trypsin . as noted above the gel lanes from the microsol fractions were cut and digested in the same manner as the gel slices from figure 3a except in this case there were no duplicate gel lanes to be combined . consistent performance of the autoinjector was monitored by weighing each sample vial before and after injection . all data were consistently analyzed and filtered as described in materials and methods which resulted in estimated false positive rates fpr calculated by dividing reverse hit peptide counts by forward hit peptide counts of 1.6 and 1.4 for 2d and 3d data respectively . a nonredundant peptide counts from a single 2d analysis combined data from increasing numbers of replicate analyses and the 3d method . a among proteins common to both data sets 491 proteins were identified by two peptides in the 2d repetitive data set . 1 for 2d an equal number of peptides for 99 proteins and more peptides for 226 proteins . hence evaluation of the merits of greater depth of analysis particularly small improvements must be constantly weighted relative to overall throughput . in this study we used a consistent gradient time and 80 lc ms ms runs for both the 3d method and the 2d repetitive run method four repeat injections . a similar increase 61 was observed in repetitive mudpit using nine analyses.10 as expected the greatest positive impact on proteome coverage was use of a second replicate run which increased the number of proteins identified by two or more peptides by 33 while doubling instrument time . although producing more fractions per gel lane increases the number of in gel digestions the overall increase in total analysis time for a proteome is minor . finally in some cases improved scores for ms2 spectra in the 3d method probably resulted from a lower probability of interfering ions being isolated with the target ion for fragmentation . a recent study suggested good reproducibility was achievable across 27 laboratories on a simple 20protein mixture after uniform data processing was used.35 but this simple sample of abundant proteins at the same concentration does not reflect real biological complexity . a second contributing factor to the initially apparent lower reproducibility at the protein list level is database redundancy and limitations of current software for consistently producing consensus protein lists from identified peptides .", "clinically collies and other related dog breeds have been observed to be more susceptible to the effects of ivermectin on the central nervous system cns .

years closely followed by age group of 45 59 years . increase in the number of vehicles in chandigarh and its neighboring states resulting in steep upward trend in the number of road accidents might lead to increase in admission of males of the productive age group . another study done in turkey also showed that the ed visit during the night had decreased substantially when compare to day time visits . even though there was highly random arrival patterns observed in the study yet surprisingly the staffing pattern was somewhat similar for all 24 h spans . in their study also suggested formulating a strong admission and discharging policy in the ed to regulate the patient turn out rate . another study done on the ed of study institute has also observed extreme rush in laboratories present within the premises of ed . cooke also concluded that waiting for results of tests was one of the four commonest reasons for patient waiting in the ed . a review on consultants in ed of tertiary hospitals had suggested that average response time of consultants ranges from 30 to 45 min depending on the current needs of the patient . has also concluded that insufficient information provided on waiting time was a cause of people s perception of waiting time being extended . one of the main limitations of the study is small sample size and short duration of study . there might be

factors include the type of patients being treated the setting in which treatment is delivered including the funding arrangements and costs incurred the attitudes and perceptions of staff about the treatment and the other psychological and physical disorders diseases and disabilities that may co occur with the condition being treated . according to beutler prognosis is attenuated by patient complexity chronicity and by an absence of patient distress . facilitating social support enhances the likelihood of good outcome among patients with complex chronic problems . in conducting an evaluation of the current program there were a variety of constraints imposed by the context . major depressive disorder single episode and recurrent dysthymic disorder depressive disorder not otherwise specified and adjustment disorder with depressed mood outpatients . a final benchmark was an outpatient evaluation of group cbt for depressed patients treated within diagnostically heterogenous groups . 1.2 with 59 of patients demonstrating a clinically significant change after treatment . the decision to admit the person as an inpatient was made by the psychiatrist and was made when it was apparent that the required treatment could not be provided optimally while the patient was in the community . and patients engage in pleasant events scheduling and behavioral assignments to practise newly developed skills . in the latter part of treatment the focus shifts to self esteem assertion and communication training and concludes with a relapse prevention module . the structure allows sufficient time and flexibility for the discussion of both group and individual issues . all patients received the questionnaires at admission discharge and where applicable at the beginning and end of the cbt program . clinic staff rated patients general level of psychiatric symptoms using the health of a nation outcome scales honos 16 17 and global assessment of function gaf . honos was introduced to the clinic in the middle of 1997 and therefore data are not available for one year of the study . calculating a reliable change index and using the normative data on the bdi described by robinson et al . comparing the present results with those of in the depressed outpatient sample it is apparent that inpatients were more severe at admission than the outpatient population i.e. 60.2 was similar to that found in an outpatient setting i.e. 59 . although the changes during the cbt program are comparable to those in published studies one possible interpretation of the present findings is that the patients would have improved to the same degree due to their hospital stay . follow up tests revealed no significant differences between groups at admission but the patients who had completed cbt were less depressed m 13.1 than those who never began cbt m 16.6 t611 2.56 p .05 who in turn were not different from those who had dropped out of cbt m 16.9 t516 0.10 p ns . assuming a degree of symptom specificity of treatments because cbt is focussed on symptoms of depression and anxiety the changes in these domains should be greater during cbt whereas the earlier phase in an inpatient admission will be focussed on acute symptom management . although there was no difference in bdi scores before and after cbt between patients with more secondary medical conditions f6146 1.67 .06 p ns there was a hint that patients with more secondary substance use problems might have worse outcomes f3149 2.44 .05 p .07 . first the hospital is a private clinic where the patients are insured and therefore the extent of generalization to the public sector is not clear . a greater frequency of psychotic disorders may mean that particular presentations were not represented in the current sample . although the internal validity of the ratings is less than those carried out by a person blind to the treatment the external validity of the ratings when conducted by clinicians who have spent two weeks with the patient is greater . another future research question could relate to the ability to deliver cbt to homogeneous patient groups . . for a suicidal patient a reduction in symptoms is going to be associated with a lowered risk of harm and therefore the sooner the reduction can be achieved the sooner a less intensive treatment regime can the implemented .", "although the

managing diabetes to control glycemia and is associated with poor compliance to medication and treatment . a similar finding has also been demonstrated by aziz1 in the ramadan study with the lowest prevalence of hypoglycemia 4.58 . these agents drugs reduce serum glucose concentrations and improve the glycemic control by augmenting the effects of incretins hence this strategy is also called incretin based therapy for diabetes management . under normal physiological state the gut in response to meals releases hormones called incretins for example glp1 glucagon like peptide1 and gip gastric inhibitory polypeptide which augment biosynthesis and secretion of insulin known as incretin effect as well as slow gastric emptying as well.1924 normally these incretin hormones are degraded within minutes after their release by the enzyme dpp4 . as the dpp4 inhibitors contrary to this normal physiology in diabetic patients the balance between insulin secretion and hepatic glucose production is dysregulated . in type 1 diabetic subjects there is absolute insulin deficiency due to autoimmunity against cells with destruction of these cells as compared with type 2 diabetic subjects who exhibit relative insulin deficiency with insulin resistance.2526 furthermore absolute or relative hyperglucagonemia due to deficiency of incretin hormones in diabetic state is a hallmark of both type 1 and type 2 diabetic subjects.2728 in other words in type 2 diabetic subjects there is insulin resistance and hyperglucagonemia . however this risk was significantly reduced when vildagliptin was prescribed during ramadan fasting and this has also been recently reported in indo pakistani populations from the uk and in cohorts of uk south asian muslim patients in the vector vildagliptin experience compared to gliclazide observed during ramadan study.4042 furthermore in general these agents have also been demonstrated to be safer in older age group.43 a recent observational study which combined metformin and vildagliptin therapy together with or without ohas during ramadan fasting has demonstrated advantage of reduced hypoglycemia incidence.44 they have shown one case of severe hypoglycemia in the arm treated with oha compared to the vildagliptin group which showed no hypoglycemia event . the hypoglycemia events were 12 times more in the group treated with oha as compared to the vildagliptin group . a recent review published in switzerland and france has studied worldwide the role of dpp4 inhibitors including vildagliptin during ramadan fasting and has come to the conclusion that the anti diabetic agents dpp4 inhibitors could be a more safer option while managing type2 diabetes during ramadan fasting with a very low risk of hypoglycemia.47 another prospective noninterventional study published in france to assess real life rate of hypoglycemia during ramadan fasting in patients with type 2 diabetes and their ongoing dual therapy of metformin vildagliptin or metformin sulfonylurea has shown that hypoglycemia as an adverse events aes was higher in su group as compared to vildagliptin group 17.9 vs 7.5 p0.025 and better compliance was seen with vildagliptin group.48 the virtue vildagliptin experience compared with sulphonylureas observed during ramadan study which recruited 1333 patients from 10 different countries worldwide has demonstrated significantly fewer hypoglycemia events as compared with su therapy 5.4 vs 19.8 respectively p0.001 .", "an increasing non enhancing component in t2weighted and fluid

progressive lesion involving non eloquent area and gamma knife surgery was reserved for the cases with small lesions and medically inoperable condition . progression was defined as a more than 25 increase in the sum of the products of perpendicular diameters as in the macdonald criteria an increase in the non enhancing lesion in recurrent cancer with bevacizumab15 . all patients were treated

intensity 1 month after bevacizumab and cpt11 the lesion showed progression at the subsequent follow up and we considered this case to be pspd . an experimental study revealed that higher exposures of tmz in brain tumor can also attribute to breakdown of the bbb20 . rano criteria were suggested to overcome the limitation of macdonald criteria and drew considerable attentions . despite current criteria as macdonald or rano purely objective judgement of treatment response only with imaging increased cbv cbf and a decreased adc value do not imply progressive disease at all times however the decisions are made from these novel imaging modalities for most of the confusing cases . also in canadian recommendations pspd can not be diagnosed until 12 weeks after the end of rt unless new lesion shows out of field5 . as our data showed no difference between etpd and ltpd confirmation after serial observations would be reasonable rather than deciding early from a little information . in the present study the regression of in field recurrence occurred 1 month after administration of the drug and remained stable disease for 11 months . . additionally bevacizumab can cause vegf independent mechanisms of progression in the heavily treated patients18 . additionally in recurrent high grade glioma bevacizumab must be administered with caution in consideration of pspd and psr . however mri

the cervix . cervical patency occurs at two time points oestrus with or without ovulation and at parturition . based on the absence of any newborn animals no mammary development and no

averaged over the ages of 2976 years . bone formation is mediated by osteoblasts . ikeda et al . however it is generally known that age related increase in serum pth contributes to the increase in bone resorption . a decline in intestinal ca absorption is also one of the causes of age related bone loss . demonstrated that plasma 125oh2d duodenal calbindin d protein and ca absorption decreased with age in rats . from the results of bone resorption and formation markers high bone turnover with resorption exceeding formation since high bone turnover is a risk factor for bone fracture and osteoporosis a high p diet might be a risk factor for bone loss not only in young mice but also in aged mice . although the mechanism underlying the high p diet induced decreased ca absorption remains unknown it is thought that the formation of insoluble ca and p salts in the intestinal lumen is an important factor . furthermore the high p diet affected pth secretion differently in young and aged mice leading to an increase in the rankl opg mrna ratio in aged mice .", "despite advancements in modern medical science and the health management industry the incidence of cerebral palsy cp continues

hmpv positive patients frequently exhibited signs of otitis media . further research is needed on the pathogenesis of hmpv in humans specifically regarding the ability of hmpv to infect human respiratory epithelial cells compared to rsv and other viruses . during the study time period our institution did not routinely test specimens for hmpv . as previously reported fever was the most common presenting symptom for hmpv positive patients and was more common in hmpv positive children than in the other two groups . as such it is possible that children infected with rsv were assigned

schematic of the procedure for the isolation of an thioester derivative of a protein of interest poi using engineered split intein fragments int and int . as part of a traceless protein purification system in this case using an artificially split intein pair . for instance many of the split dnae inteins have half lives for the splicing reaction of less than a minute as compared to several hours in the case of the cis splicing inteins commonly used in epl . accordingly the npuaa peptide was immobilized on a solid support through a unique cys residue engineered within its c extein region figure s5 . after a brief incubation 5 min at rt the column was extensively washed to remove contaminants and thiolysis was triggered by addition of a buffer containing the thiol mercaptoethansulfonate mes . furthermore we showed that the int column could be regenerated and reused at least 5 times with only minimal loss of capacity figures s11 and s12 . a mbp b phpt1 and c ub mercaptoethansulfonate mes thioesters were purified in one step from e. coli cell lysates using the int column . an attractive feature of epl is that it can allow for the preparation of site

.", "biological membranes are mainly composed of phospholipids sphingolipids cholesterol and membrane associated proteins . although glycosphingolipids gsls were originally thought to be structural components of plasma membranes several experiments suggested that gsls are involved in the regulation of numerous cellular functions . moreover the phosphorylated product of sphingosine sphingosine1phosphate s1p was shown to be important in immunological especially inflammatory reactions 4 6 . cholesterol is composed of a highly hydrophobic sterol ring system and 3hydroxy moiety the only hydrophilic part of the molecule . for degradation those molecules are constitutively degraded by their suitable catabolic enzymes . for instance genetic disorder of glucocerebrosidase gba ec 3.2.1.45 gaucher disease results in accumulation of glccer and its deacetylated form glucosylsphingosine is caused by abnormality of gba . among gsls laccer has been well described to bind to several kinds of microorganisms including viruses and fungi . for instance candida albicans specifically bind to laccer though the binding of 16long glucosyl side chain branched 13glucan to laccer enriched

of proliferating undifferentiated keratinocytes the stratum basale and several superficial layers of the stratum spinosum and stratum granulosum sg which form the stratum corneum sc . the sc acts as an air liquid interface barrier to avoid drying of tissues in contact with air . however there are significant differences in immunological reactions between mice and human . a neutral cdase from pseudomonas aeruginosa an17 pacdase isolated from a patient with atopic dermatitis ad was shown to require detergents to hydrolyze ceramide . a three dimensionally cultured human primary keratinocyte 3d keratinocyte culture system has been utilized to simulate epidermal differentiation at its air liquid interface resulting in the generation of basal spinous and granular layers and an sc with the latter displaying permeability barrier functions . cdna microarray analysis showed that s1p strongly upregulated the expression of endothelin1 cxcl1 tnf defensin 5 il8 cxcl2 interferon regulatory factor 1 gadd45 gamma and il23 subunit mrnas . il8 cxcl1 and cxcl2 have been reported to be upregulated in the lesional skin of patients with ad and psoriasis . s1p also enhanced the expression of claudin4 mrna which has been observed in more layers of psoriatic than normal epidermis . infliximab a chimeric igg1 monoclonal antibody against human tnf inhibits the tnfmediated production of il8 by keratinocytes . endothelin1 has been shown to elicit itch in humans 8082 . antibodies against neuronal tissues are involved in immune mediated neurological disorders with expression of several of

could be performed . the phospholipid fractions were then methylated to fa methyl esters fames by the lepage and roy method.19 the fames of individual fas of phospholipids were separated by gas chromatography using a model 6890 apparatus agilent technologies palo alto ca usa and a 30 m omegawaz tm 250 capillary column supelco bellefonte pa usa.20 peak retention times were obtained by comparison with known standards 37 component fame mix and pufa2 supelco glc37 nucheck prep elysian mn usa and analyzed with chemstation software agilent technologies . the average of duplicate measurements for each sample was calculated.1121 plasma phospholipid fas were expressed as the percentage of total fas . hypertension was defined as having resting systolic blood pressure 140 mmhg or diastolic blood pressure 90 mmhg on repeated measurements or receiving treatment with anti hypertensive medications . diabetes mellitus was diagnosed when the patient had fasting blood glucose level 7.0 mmol l or was being treated with oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin . patients were defined as smokers if they were smokers at the stroke event or if they had stopped smoking within 1 year before the stroke event . body mass index was estimated by dividing body weight by height kg m . the presence of coronary artery disease was defined as a patient history of unstable angina myocardial infarction or angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease . all statistical analyses were performed using the windows spss software package version 18.0 chicago il usa . categorical variables were compared using the chi square test or fisher s exact test . continuous variables were expressed as meansstandard deviations sd or as medians and interquartile ranges iqr . functional outcome was dichotomized into good outcome mrs 3 or poor outcome mrs 3 . to assess the goodness of fit of the logistic regression model cox snell r square was calculated and the hosmer lemeshow test was performed . of all patients there were 60 38.5 patients with large artery atherosclerosis stroke subtype and 96 61.5 patients with small vessel occlusions . after adjusting for factors including age sex and variables with p0.1 in the univariate analysis stroke subtypes hemoglobin high density lipoprotein high sensitivity c reactive protein fasting glucose 160 palmitic acid and saturated fatty acids lower proportion of epa and dha were independently associated with stroke severity on admission 0.751 standard error se 0.376 p0.048 for epa 0.610 se 0.215 p0.005 for dha . 1 . considering stroke subtypes a

inflammatory molecules resolvins and protectins through lipoxygenase or cyclo oxygenase pathways.2829 resolvins or protectins play an important role in the resolution of inflammation which decreases atherosclerotic changes and tissue injuries . moreover even though we prospectively enrolled our study subjects our study design is mainly cross sectional . finally our study design was not that of a randomized control study . that is there may be a possibility that the functional outcome at 3 months is only weakly associated with 3pufas . 3pufas may be considered potential blood biomarkers for prognosis of acute non cardiogenic ischemic stroke patients .", "a tendency toward backward mandibular rotation was associated with a pronounced apposition below the symphysis with more overall concavity of the inferior mandibular border . also a ratio of posterior s go to anterior face height n me of 56 62 indicated a posterior mgp whereas a ratio of 65 80 indicated an anterior growth tendency . assessed symphyseal height depth ratio h d and angle . a mandible with an anterior growth direction was associated with a small height large depth small ratio and large angle of the symphysis . lateral cephalometric radiographs and charts of adolescents aged between 9 and 14 years were used in this study . baccetti s method for evaluation of the cervical maturation stage the symphyseal measurement included height depth and ratio h d measured according to the aki et al . linear measurements used the tangent drawn at point b and parallel and perpendicular lines drawn to this tangent . cephalometric measurements used to quantify symphysis morphology all radiographs were taken with the same panoramic radiographic device planmeca proline x helsinki finland . all of them were scanned and digitized dpi 300 and the measurements were made using dolphin imaging software version 10 patterson dental supply usa for symphyseal parameters real size tracings were printed by dolphin imaging software and measured using a grid . after confirmation of normality of the groups and equation of their variances the two way analysis of variance anova model was assessed by adjusted chi square for analysis of data p 0.001 and the comparison of cases with the normal group was performed using the dunnett method . for evaluation of intraobserver reliability intraclass correlation coefficient icc was assessed and the reliability was approved icc coefficiency was between 0.0726 and 0.0871 . evaluation of 60 normal radiographs with the baccetti method showed that 21 were in stage iii 29 were in stage ii and the remaining were in stage i. the case groups also were selected from the patients in stage iii and matched to 15 samples with normal radiographs which were in the same stage . comparison of each case group with normal group showed only statistically significant differences between the normal group and cl ii horizontal and cl iii vertical groups in height p 0.001 . quantification of skeletal data has been shown to be an effective and reliable method of demonstrating variation in human growth as well as for monitoring and interpreting the growth of various skeletal elements in the living . is symphysis morphology . despite wide variations in the size and shape of the human face head and body significant relationships were found between the measures of mandibular incisor crowding and basal bone dimensions in female subjects . the samples were also matched based on gender . conversely in patients with greater symphyseal height and small chin an extraction approach is preferred for compensation of arch length discrepancies . consequently they subdivided the size of the symphysis into large small and medium . in summary we can conclude that female adolescents had greater symphyseal ratio in comparison to male adolescents .", "established in 2003 erste foundation has a history stretching back 190 years to the year 1819 when it was founded

permanent cell cycle arrest occurs with cells remaining in g0g1 phase during senescence . . a comparison of the telomere shortening rates in different hdfs under different conditions revealed that the ratio between oxidative damage and antioxidative defence was quantitatively the most important determinant of telomere shortening . accumulating evidence demonstrated that vitamin e the most potent lipid peroxyl radical scavenger significantly reduced free radical induced chromosomal damage . based on its lipophilicity vitamin e is considered to be the major chain breaking antioxidant preventing the propagation of oxidative stress especially in biological membranes . after incubation at room temperature for 30 min for the telomerase extension reaction samples were heated to 92c for 3 min to inactivate telomerase followed by pcr amplification . a total damage score was determined by multiplying the number of cells assigned to each grade of damage by the numeric value of the grade

and monitoring . a diagnostic tool that can globally diagnose ded regardless of the cause may be valuable in helping physicians establish an earlier and more accurate dry eye diagnosis . it is accompanied by increased osmolarity of the tear film and inflammation of the ocular surface.2 dry eye is a multifactorial disease .. that results in symptoms of discomfort visual disturbance and tear film instability with potential damage to the ocular surface . a literature search was conducted using pubmed in june 2014 using the search term tear osmolarity to identify all potentially relevant articles to that date . a rating of all relevant articles was performed using the grading of recommendations assessment development and evaluation grade which is based on the likelihood that further research is required to confirm the significance of reported results6 as well as the university of michigan practice guideline which is based on the study design.7 the grade scoring included consideration of both study sample size and financial interest disclosures in evaluating the quality of the evidence . relevant data were entered into an access database microsoft corporation redmond wa usa for analysis . table 2 shows the breakdown of articles by grading and impression . approximately two thirds of the articles were independent with the remaining third sponsored by tearlab or others . a further 19 632 were neutral while 9 332 of the articles suggested there was little value to the use of tear osmolarity . for instance meibomian gland dysfunction may not increase tear osmolarity as demonstrated in one study.17 one explanation for this is that meibomian gland dysfunction alone may not be sufficient at overwhelming the homeostatic control in most patients . examining all such studies in the present review there is an indication that osmolarity is correlated with some other diagnostic tests but the correlation is less apparent when looking only at those studies rated moderate quality or higher . certain factors diseases or drugs have been noted to be associated with ded and increased tear osmolarity . such reactions will be a function of the individual s response to these stresses and whether or not their eyes are able to adjust . in one study subjects exposed to low relative humidity of 20 for 10 minutes.20 another study found that exposure to humidity of 5 for 2 hours did not increase or result in more variability in tear osmolarity.21 both studies included subjects who were using artificial tears before the study although they discontinued use more than 1 hour in advance of testing . one study did not specify the type of artificial tear used and the other did not state the airflow velocity . the differences in reported results are likely a function of the wearer s ability to maintain homeostasis of their tear film overcoming the drying effect of contact lenses.10 it appears that certain procedures may influence tear osmolarity more than others . in a recent 2013 article no change in tear osmolarity or any other dry eye diagnostic test was observed after refractive surgery despite a decrease in corneal sensitivity.26 after cataract surgery tear osmolarity has been noted to increase.27 the difference here may be explained by the subjects ages average age was 26 years in the refractive surgery study26 and 71 years in the cataract surgery study.27 older patients may take longer to recover from surgically induced ocular trauma.27 trabeculectomy surgery performed on a patient population with an average age of 71 years also had higher tear osmolarity than a control group this result was attributed to the presence of the bleb the use of mitomycin c which may cause epithelial damage or the residual effects of long term use of glaucoma medications before surgery.28 no difference in tear osmolarity was noted between the eye that underwent eyelid reconstruction surgery and the un operated eye of the same patient this result may be related with corrective tearing as evidenced by the higher schirmer s test results in the operated eye.29 table 4 shows studies that investigated the effect of various ocular and systemic conditions on tear osmolarity . of the systemic conditions diabetes was found to increase tear osmolarity.3031 an increase in tear osmolarity was correlated with an increase in diabetes duration . another study found that low levels of 17beta estradiol estrone and testosterone were associated with increased tear osmolarity treatment with phytoestrogen decreased tear osmolarity when compared to a control group.37 more studies in this area appear warranted to further understand the correlation between sex hormones and tear osmolarity adequate control of hydration or measurement of hydration status may be important in such studies . for instance eyes with pseudoexfoliation syndrome a condition that is thought to alter goblet cell activity and mucin production have been reported to have increased tear osmolarity when compared to a control group.38 patients with pterygia a predominantly inflammatory condition also show increased tear osmolarity when compared with a control group.39 keratoconus has been demonstrated to reduce corneal sensitivity but tear osmolarity was similar to a control group . the use of oral mucolytics often to treat respiratory conditions increases tear osmolarity . this increase is most likely due to alterations to the mucin layer of the tear film.43 glaucoma medications increased tear osmolarity perhaps due to the preservatives while such medications did not have a significant effect on tbut or schirmer s test results.28 artificial tears have been noted by several studies to decrease tear osmolarity204445 but one study found no correlation between tear osmolarity and the use of artificial tears.16 the latter study did not disclose the type of artificial tear used . dry eye is a multifactorial disease with no clear gold standard diagnostic test so randomized masked trials and comparisons to a relevant control are more difficult to design . it may also be due to the difference in disease severity of the tested groups given the strong correlation between tear osmolarity and disease severity.911 the more severe the ded the higher the threshold and the greater the variability in the tear osmolarity value.9 the currently agreed upon value that discriminates between healthy and dry eyes is when the higher tear film osmolarity value of the two eyes is 308 mosm l.510 as with any diagnostic tool interpretation must be based on the complete clinical picture including other diagnostic tests that might be helpful in determining the dry eye etiology.10 certain commonly encountered external factors such as contact lens wear may or may not increase tear osmolarity depending on the individual response.224 the impact of environmental factors such as temperature humidity and airflow on tear osmolarity appears unclear as is the effect of sex hormones these factors would benefit from further investigation.2021253637 the effect of ocular surgery on tear osmolarity may be partially dependent on the patient s age the type of surgery performed and the ability of the eye to recover.2629 systemic conditions commonly believed to result in dry eye such as dehydration diabetes and thyroid ophthalmopathy have been shown to increase tear osmolarity as expected.313235 ocular conditions such as herpetic keratitis pterygia and pseudoexfoliation syndrome have also been demonstrated to increase tear osmolarity.383941 keratoconus largely viewed clinically as a non inflammatory condition was not associated with increased tear osmolarity.40 some pharmaceuticals such as mucin altering drugs and glaucoma medications appear to increase tear osmolarity while others such as artificial tears likely lower tear osmolarity.202843 research into the effect of anti inflammatory medications on tear osmolarity has produced varied results the topic deserves further investigation.484951 there are limitations in any review of this nature and consequently to any of our comments related to the factors associated with osmolarity . by confining the review to tear osmolarity related discussions of some of the dry eye issues such as the effect of hormones in some papers will have been missed

treatment plans often include surgery . a low initial hemoglobin level measured at disease presentation is a risk factor for further development of anemia throughout the course of treatment . endogenous erythropoietin normally stimulates the bone marrow to increase red blood cell rbc mass under hypoxic conditions but if this nonhemodynamic response to hypoxia is impaired then hemoglobin levels do not rebound sufficiently . although allogeneic blood is now reportedly safer than ever safety issues with the blood supply still exist . as the baby boomer population ages two factors are converging that will limit blood availability and drive up its cost . first the eligible donor pool is shrinking and second surgery in these patients whether elective or otherwise is on the increase . multiple clinical studies involving many different surgical types have shown that preoperative rhuepo is safe and effective . this treatment allowed for higher rbc volumes to be donated compared with placebo treated patients . even in anemic gastrointestinal cancer patients rhuepo facilitated pad compared with patients who were supplemented with iron alone . although a field of medicine unto itself the practice of bloodless surgery is gaining attention and therefore deserves brief mention . in a case study involving 48 jehovah s witness patients rhuepo was successfully used to avoid

with pbs the sperm were transferred into wells 200 l well of a black 96well microplate and the fluorescence intensity was measured biotek synergy2 multiplatform automated plate reader using excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 530 nm respectively . fluorescence intensity values were then plotted against phe values to obtain the calibration curve . bcef loaded sperm were treated with increasing concentrations of curcumin and the fluorescence intensities were measured and converted to intracellular ph using the calibration curve . fluorescence intensity values lower than the

upper quadrant mass and pleural effusion on chest x ray . a 48year old female with the past medical history of diabetes coronary artery disease and psoriasis presented with acute onset of diffuse abdominal pain 2 days prior to admission to the hospital . an acute abdominal series was obtained demonstrating free air below the right hemidiaphragm fig . 1 . because the patient s vital signs stabilized after being resuscitated the decision was made to obtain a ct scan to better assess the location of the perforated viscus . the patient then became increasingly confused and her vital signs again deteriorated demonstrating worsening sepsis . although a rare disease splenic abscess should be included on the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting to the hospital with peritonitis or pneumoperitoneum . in retrospect an open laparotomy was the best approach to this patient s care as it allowed for better visualization and irrigation of the abdominal cavity . in our case the patient remained in the hospital for only 10 days after converting to the open procedure . although our transesophageal echocardiogram and panorex were both negative we believe this splenic abscess developed as a result of translocation of the oral flora as the patient was complaining of a tooth ache 1 week prior to her presentation . although there is still controversy in the current literature when managing splenic abscesses our recommendation is splenectomy especially in the case of ruptured splenic abscess resulting in hemodynamic instability . there are no conflicts of interests or financial

seen in figure 6 parenchymal volume goes down with age number of words recalled also declines and the parenchymal volume is associated with memory even with age effects partialled out . activation patterns are linked to performance on cognitive tasks requiring verbal spatial attention memory and facial processing . however we used tasks that are quite resistant to age effects and the results may differ for tasks showing greater age related decline . madden et al in a cbf study using spect reported that several cbf activations were greater for young than for older adults . in a pet study

technique relies on magnetic susceptibility effects of deoxyhemoglobin which cause regional decreases in signal in imaging sequences sensitive to susceptibility eg echoplanar . a typical response is a 1 to 25 increase in regional image intensity which develops over 3 to 8 seconds following task initiation . a well characterized brain registration algorithm was used to register the tl images from the different subjects to that of one particular subject . effects of aging on regional activation in relation to cognitive strategics have not yet been examined with fmri . as is generally the case for age related changes the hormonal environment can have pervasive effects that require scrutiny not only during early development but also during the perimenopausal phase . recent studies suggest that estrogen has a protective effect with respect to onset of alzheimer s disease and cognitive decline . although we have focused on findings in healthy people the effects have implications for brain disorders where gender differences have been observed across the life span . for females with improved understanding of regional brain activity during emotion processing we maybe in a position

by multiplying diabetes population figures by the per capita healthcare expenditures the total healthcare budget for people diagnosed with diabetes is derived . analysis of the 1992 2010 moh database suggests that the number of people diagnosed with diabetes increased by 1.6 million or 183 during the last 18 years . comparison of the 2010 diabetes figure to the 1992 figure suggests that the net number of people diagnosed with diabetes is growing by about 0.1 million per year . it is important to mention that the population age 60 years and above represents the highest percentage increase among population diagnosed with diabetes during the last 18 years of analysis . although the population diagnosed with diabetes comprises more than 9 of the saudi population in 2010 almost 1 in 11 people in saudi arabia having diabetes and if the present prevalence rate remains unchanged over time the ratio of people with to without diabetes will increase by almost 1 in 5 people having the

placebo controlled trial to assess whether treatment with pravastatin diminishes the risk of major cardiovascular events in the elderly 1213 . between december 1997 and may 1999 a total of 5804 participants aged 7082 years with preexisting vascular disease or increased risk of such disease due to a history of smoking hypertension or diabetes were recruited in scotland ireland and the netherlands . the rotterdam study is a large prospective population based cohort study that is conducted among all inhabitants aged 55 years of ommoord a district of rotterdam the netherlands 14 . the medical ethics committee of the erasmus university of rotterdam approved the study and written informed consent was obtained from all participants . of 10275 eligible subjects 7983 individuals 78 participated in the baseline examinations between 1990 and 1993 mean age 71 25 years range 55106 years . all participants were interviewed at home and visited the research center for further examinations . of the 5599 participants 580 did not have all cognitive function tests available at baseline . all of the resulting 5019 participants had full data available for other cardiovascular risk factors including bmi systolic and diastolic blood pressure and hdl cholesterol levels at baseline . this resulted in a study sample of 5019 participants for prosper . of these participants 3664 were free of dementia and 3550 of those had data available for other cardiovascular risk factors including bmi systolic and diastolic blood pressure and hdl cholesterol levels . additionally in 3342 of these 3428 participants fasting insulin levels were assessed at the third survey . at baseline history of diabetes was defined by self reported history of diabetes reporting the use of oral antidiabetes medication the use of insulin treatment by diet or registration by a general practitioner as having diabetes in both study samples . executive function was assessed with the letter digit substitution task ldst 16 and the abbreviated stroop test part 3 17 in both studies as well as with the word fluency test wft 18 in the rotterdam study only . a compound cognitive test score for the 12plt was calculated by averaging the z scores of the 12plt immediate and the 12plt delayed recall test . the time point of the last measurement was different for the participants and ranged from 36 to 48 months after baseline . therefore we performed the analyses with their individual varying time point but report the results for the mean of these time points at 42 months . of the 3428 participants of the rotterdam sample who were present at the third survey 2601 remained in the study until the end of follow up fourth survey and were available for the assessment of change in

4.6year interval which could have led to selective nonparticipation of those in whom dementia was diagnosed between cognitive examinations n 85 and did not visit the research center for the follow up assessment . in individual participants diabetes and impaired fasting glucose levels often co occur with other cardiovascular risk factors . in our study the clustering of these factors of the metabolic syndrome with the fasting glucose levels could have influenced our results . although it is difficult to address the role of these suggested mechanisms our study of 8000 participants shows that the effect of increased fasting glucose levels on cognitive function seems to be long term and independent of other cardiovascular risk factors like bmi blood pressure and hdl cholesterol levels . however small effect sizes do not automatically imply irrelevance of the observed effect as small effects on the group level can indeed represent large effects for a number of participants . in the analyses of the annual decline in cognitive function the prosper sample failed to show a clear decline in mmse score over time although this was seen in the rotterdam sample with participants of comparable age . it is possible that a potential learning effect of the mmse had a higher impact on the prosper sample compared with the rotterdam study sample because of the shorter time span between cognitive measurements 19 . additionally the selection criteria for participants in prosper baseline mmse score 24 may have resulted in a sample of participants with slightly better cognitive function which is also represented in the difference in mmse scores of both samples at baseline and might have had an effect on the annual decline of mmse score that was measured in prosper . the strengths of this study consist of the prospective design the large number of participants in both studies and the dedicated neuropsychological test battery that was used in both samples . a large variation in fasting glucose levels over time could have disturbed our analyses through the phenomenon of regression to the mean .", " as mentioned in the report of the national eye institute dry eye is a disorder of the tear film due to tear deficiency or excessive tear evaporation which causes damage to the interpalpebral ocular surface and is associated with symptoms of ocular discomfort . . brennan and efron found that 75 of low oxygen permeable lens wearers report a feeling of discomfort at the end of the day related to dry eye . among other things comfort depends on a given material s rate of on eye dehydration 711 wettability 12 13 and the presence of surface deposits 810 . accordingly solutions containing polyhexanides specifically polyaminopropyl biguanide papb and polyhexamethylene biguanide phmb are known to increase the potential for adverse reactions . absorption and release rates vary depending on the agents and materials used and not their surface treatment which determines compatibility between certain solutions and certain materials . cmc is a water soluble synthetic cellulose derivative with marked hydrophilic and bioadhesive properties that promote faster repair of the eye surface . this study received approval from the ethics committee for health sciences of universit de montral . inclusion and exclusion criteria of subjects are listed in table 1 . after being enrolled subjects were asked to observe a wash out period of 72 hours without contact lenses before the beginning of the study . however every lens fitted had to be centered to offer a movement of 0.2 mm maximum upon blinking and did not expose the limbus in any manner in any gaze . nothing was said to subjects about potential clinical effects of this product not to justify its use before insertion . at the 1month visit a case history was performed to identify subjects level of compliance with the protocol and to answer any questions that might be raised by them . a slit lamp exam was performed to evaluate conjunctival and corneal staining conjunctival hyperemia and tear break up time tbut . efron s grading scale was used to evaluate the presence and severity of clinical signs with grades varying from 0 absence to 4 severe . fluorescein was observed using a cobalt blue filter and a yellow filter kodak wratten filter number 12 to reveal any contrasts . a new pair of lenses was then provided and subjects were asked to observe a 48 h00 wash out period of time without lenses worn . subjects were seen a month later for the final visit and the same clinical procedures were repeated . a total of 61 patients completed the study successfully 18 males 30 and 43 females 70 . at the beginning of the study subjects reported spending 5 hours day on average 3 hours at work and 2 hours outside on computer work . only 561 8.1 had received a positive diagnosis of dry eye in the past while 19 of them 31.1 self reported suffering from ocular dryness periodically . also 50 fewer subjects showed clinically significant staining grades 2 3 with this usage . clinically significant hyperemia grade 2 and over was also markedly reduced 10 subjects at v1 versus 3 at v2 . on the other hand when we paired results for the same individual subject compared to himself from v1 to v2 there was an increase in the tbut value that is considered statistically significant tukey kramer q 19801 p 005 od and q 19765 p 005 os . accordingly discomfort q4 dryness q5 visual changes q6 soreness and irritation q7 grittiness and scratchiness q8 foreign body sensation q9 burning q10 photophobia q11 and itching q12 were analyzed . at the end of the day 15 more patients report no symptom with the use of sh drop v2 f461 5.4858 p 0.03 even after many hours of wear . again this result is the same with all the care system used with no significant differences among groups . at visit 1 84.7 of the wearers report this symptom as never or infrequently present while 15.3 report it as frequent or constant . a highly significant difference exists between visit 1 and 2 chi square f461 14.0198 p 0.00 with a strong correlation r 02463 . there is a significant difference at every time point but the most obvious difference is during the evening f461 10.943 p 000 r 0.1817 . at the last visit subjects rated the ease of use of the 2 care regimens they used in the past 2 months with and without sh drops . none of the subjects would not recommend the system item 4 and 5 . one could argue that the lack of a control group using another type of lubricating drop would have been beneficial . even if the symptoms remain symptom severity is greatly reduced with the use of sh drops cldeq q5 . a single drop put on the lens before insertion can considerably change the contact lens experience for subjects who report ocular dryness . a sodium hyaluronate drop before insertion of contact lenses improves the overall comfort but its clinical effect is highly significant at the end of the wearing period during the evening . because of that it is possible to say that the use of sh based drops blink contacts before insertion addresses the two major reasons why contact lens wearers drop out from the market .", "we are grateful for financial support from the industrial source technology development program of the ministry of knowledge economy 10044909 the next generation biogreen 21 program ssac

physician attempted to remove the residual rust ring after removal of a piece of metallic foreign body . after 48 h of treatment there was no significant improvement in the right eye . concerns were raised about possible complications such as secondary angle closure glaucoma and prolonged hypotony . as the wound was completely punched out injected viscoelastic materials in the anterior chamber came out from the wound which made it quite difficult to dry the surface of the cornea for application of tissue adhesive . therefore to provide a necessary support for the gluing amniotic membrane plugging was tried but it was too slippery to be fixed on the wound . a blunt 27gauge needle with a 2mm bent tip attached to a viscoelastic injecter was gently inserted into the anterior chamber

provide a stable support for the tissue adhesive .", "however this view has been challenged and a recent large scale study has shown that relatives of individuals affected with schizophrenia have increased risks of bipolar disorder and vice versa . although these findings were interesting incomplete penetrance of the mutations and lack of power made the results equivocal . a burden analysis study of approximately 200 affected individuals identified two translocation events at nrxn1 in separate samples one disrupting the coding sequence and the other lying 5 to the gene . a further study of over 1000 pedigrees using approximately 10000 single nucleotide polymorphisms snps identified a 300 kb deletion of coding exons of nrxn1 co segregating with autism . a whole genome screen for large chromosomal abnormalities using array cgh performed in 93 individuals with schizophrenia identified a hemizygous loss at nrxn1 in one case . although the available data provide relatively strong evidence that disruption of the neurexin1 locus nrxn1 is a risk factor for schizophrenia and asds evidence in relation to bipolar disorder is lacking . deletions of neurexin result in increased lethality normal synapse number and gross anatomy but severely impaired synaptic functioning a pattern strikingly similar to neuroligin gene knockouts . further work on the biology of neurexins

present study is quite poor and is lower than the specificities reported by other workers ranging from 64.3 to 82.489 it is however higher than 23 reported by akinbami et al.6 the heterogeneity in the methodology of these studies may have been responsible for the differences obtained between the present study and some of the earlier studies . for instance akinbami et al.6 used rectal temperature of

temperature of 37.5c as the definition of fever . although palpation overestimates fever the elicitation of fever by mothers would encourage early presentation as it has been documented that the concern for fever is a strong motivational factor for seeking medical care.2 the educational qualification of a mother did not influence the accuracy of palpation for the presence of fever . the sensitivity specificity npv and ppv of palmer surface was higher than that of the dorsal surface or the use of both surfaces . it was observed that palpation of multiple sites was more sensitive than

use of antibiotics which were confirmed to have covered the pathogenic bacteria in the drug sensitive test later . patients with timely cvc removal and appropriate antibiotic use were assigned to group a. patients with timely cvc removal and inappropriate antibiotic use were assigned to group b. patients with untimely cvc removal and appropriate antibiotic use were assigned to group c. finally patients with untimely cvc removal and inappropriate antibiotic use were assigned to group d. all continuous data are expressed as means standard deviation sd . categorical data are presented as proportions and were compared using chi square tests using a segmentation approach to compare group pairs . the mean time of cvc indwelling was 20.89.2 days range 739 days and 64.3 of the participants had cvc indwelling for 14 days . there were 27 20 15 and 11 patients assigned to groups a b c and d respectively . the factors that were statistically significant p0.05 in univariate analyses were included in the multivariate analysis . femoral cvc showed the shortest time to crbsi onset 14.25.1 days followed by internal jugular cvc 20.98.0 and subclavian cvc 33.83.9 all p0.05 . vancomycin resistant enterococci vre infection was seen in 5 cases . carbapenem resistant gram negative bacteria crgnb were detected in 13 cases table 5 . all 73 crbsi patients manifested fever with a body temperature ranging from 38.1 to 40.3c including 20 cases 27.3 with a body temperature of 38.139c and 53 cases 77.7 with a body temperature of 39c . abnormal liver function mild to moderate elevation of alt and ast levels was detected in 17 cases 23.2 . abnormal renal function except 6 cases with renal failure before enrollment in the study was found in 27 cases 36.9 with the highest serum creatinine level being 671 mol l . circulation failure was observed in 23 cases 31.5 and 27 cases 50.9 were found to be complicated by mods . seventeen cases had their cvc removed after a report of positive blood culture while cvc was not removed in 9 cases . advanced age long term catheter indwelling parenteral nutrition diabetes apache ii score 23 and 3 types of underlying diseases are well known risk factors of crbsi . indeed the mortality rate from crbsi is reported to be 8.8 in subjects aged 65 years but only 3.8 in those aged 65 years . indeed a large proportion of our patients had high apache ii scores and a large number of concomitant diseases . accordingly a previous study showed that the mortality rate due to crbsi in the icu was 28.1 in critically ill patients . accordingly the subclavian vein is recommended as the first choice of the site for catheterization in the idsa guidelines followed by the internal jugular vein and the femoral vein . in addition crbsi occurred later when using the single lumen catheter than with double lumen catheter . cons were predominant in the gram positive bacteria followed by mrsa with 85.7 of the staphylococci resistant to methicillin and 41.7 of the enterococci resistant to vancomycin . candida albicans constituted only 42.9 of candida infections . however the distribution of the causal agents in the present study was slightly different from that observed in the united states . in addition adequate anti infective therapy for crbsi should be administered to prevent complications such as inflammatory deep venous thrombosis and infectious endocarditis .", "a large number of bioactive compounds targeting ar have been identified via screening efforts . androgens are a class of steroid hormones that consist of 19carbon derivatives of cholesterol and are synthesized by the testis and adrenal glands . as the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in men 258 000year approximately one out of every six men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in the u.s . if detected early an arsenal of therapeutic options currently provide a promising chance for long term survival . however 40 of patients will develop castration resistant prostate cancer crpc arising from drug resistance vida infra which is associated with poor survival rates . the ar consists of four basic elements n terminal domain dna binding domain hinge region and the ligand binding domain lbd . arg752 forms a hydrogen bond with the o3 atom ketone of the steroid ligand . abbreviations dht dihydrotestosterone hsp heat shock protein p phosphorylation site fxxlf coactivator protein . although many hypotheses regarding the involvement of ar in prostate cancer progression have been postulated the precise molecular mechanisms are not fully understood . alterations in ar co regulatory protein balance somatic gain of function mutations within ar with the majority in the lbd resulting in activation by other steroid hormones and anti androgens generation of new fusion gene products ar ligand independent activation via cross talk with other signaling pathways . additionally drug resistance has been proposed to arise from constitutively active ar splice variants lacking the ar ligand binding domain . by use of conjugates dubbed proteolysis targeting chimeric molecules protacs the first steroid conjugate to selectively induce ar degradation was developed . a significant decrease in ar protein level proteolysis targeting chimeric molecules protacs for ar a synthesis of protac5 b chemical structure of protac aa c chemical structure of small molecule e3 recognition element left and cocrystal structure of small molecule e3 recognition element blue sticks and e3 orange surface rendered right pdb code 3zrc . apoptosis or programmed cell death is a physiological cell suicide mechanism critical to cellular homeostasis . iaps contain a ring domain that possesses e3 activity establishing the ability to induce proteasomal degradation by tagging proteins with ubiquitin chains . relative to protacs snipers consist of a targeting moiety dht linker and a recognition element for iaps . chemical structure of specific and nongenetic iaps dependent protein eraser 13 sniper13 . although widely used in the clinic these agents are generally nonspecific and exhibit shortcomings that include severe side effects resulting from compromised normal cell viability and drug resistance . conjugation of a targeting moiety to metallo based cytotoxic agents could potentially circumvent nonspecific interactions by selectivity targeting cells that overexpress particular proteins establishing a delivery vector to localize the effects of new therapeutic agents . additionally the cis conjugate exhibited greater potency than cisplatin itself ic50 32 m . administration of the alkylating agent at a concentration of 10 m induced apoptosis as determined by flow cytometry and cleavage of poly adp ribose polymerase parp in western blot analysis . as expected the negative control did not induce apoptosis at an equivalent concentration . a control peptoid conjugate outfitted with pr ligands did not activate ar in a luciferase reporter assay suggesting the ethisterone conjugates are selective for ar . importantly cytotoxic effects of conjugates 6 and 7 were not observed in cell lines that do not express ar pc3 and hek293 cells establishing that conjugates selectively target ar . figure is adapted from ref 90 . bivalent agonist conjugates displayed weak binding affinity presumably due to burial of the hydrophilic linker within the protein interior . additionally a 29 linker was found to induce an intermolecular binding event . a critical objective from a molecular design approach is the ability to induce different er conformations that are dependent upon ligand binding . additional preclinical studies will be required to validate their potential for clinical translation .", "delays at any level of management from the prehospital setting to the emergency department ed and subsequently to the cardiac catheterisation laboratory must be minimised . a relatively new praecordial v1v6 v quick patch has been developed and it provides a one piece template for the placement of all six praecordial leads which makes application easy . any volunteer who was incidentally found to have significant ecg changes were given an appointment with a cardiologist for the necessary evaluation . preparation consisted of cleaning the skin with alcohol wipes at the site for lead placement . electrodes were placed in the routine standard positions for the single electrode 12lead ecg . both the inter assessor consistency between the two readers of the ecgs and intra assessor same interpretation for both ecgs in the same volunteer agreement were analysed . the guide template has the flexibility to accommodate different body sizes and geometries by allowing the movement of each praecordial electrode along the guide to attain the best suit for the recommended position figs . 2the standard single lead electrocardiogram ecg system the v quick patch placement system the standard single lead electrocardiogram ecg system p values and confidence intervals were analysed using student s t test . all 300 volunteers were compared for the two techniques the v quick method was also shown to be significantly faster 45.43.8 versus 61.93.5 s p0.0001 table 2 . in female volunteers the longer time required can be explained by the presence of breast tissue which requires more attention to be paid to the standard landmarks and whether the leads should be placed over or under the breast tissue . here the nurses performing the ecgs on every individual marked the points of application with a skin marker to reduce the variability in placement between the two techniques . . in the application adjustments had to be made to the template thus creating more this may have been due to the slightly smaller chest expanse of the average asian compared to their caucasian counterpart .", "a cross sectional descriptive study of 125 consecutive phrynoderma patients attending the outpatient department opd of dermatology was conducted in a tertiary care hospital during a period of two years . in all patients a detailed history with particular reference to age gender seasonal variations socioeconomic status and family history of disease and cutaneous examination findings such as distribution sites of involvement morphology of the lesions and signs of nutritional deficiencies were noted . among 125 patients 79 63.2 were male and 46 36.8 female . a majority of the patients 88 were from low socioeconomic group and the remaining 12 were from middle socioeconomic group . during a calendar year 8.33 of the patients presented during summer 46.7 in the rainy and 45 in winter season . elbows and buttocks alone were affected in 16 12.8 and 2 1.6 patients respectively table 2 . although the occurrence of phrynoderma has been related to nutritional status of the patient in the present study the signs and symptoms of nutritional deficiency the ocular manifestations of vit a deficiency in patients with phrynoderma have been reported to be 5 . diet survey and serum vit a levels in apparently healthy phrynoderma patients and normal controls revealed no statistically significant difference between the two groups . the ratio of eicosatrienoic acid and arachidonic acid 0.4 is considered as an accurate indicator of efa deficiency . in ai the fatty acids are estimated according to the number of double bonds and their chain length is not taken into consideration thereby overestimating the dienoic and trienoic acids and underestimating the tetraenoic and pentaenoic acids . riboflavin is required for pyridoxine metabolism which in turn is required for tryptophan niacin metabolism and niacin is necessary for fatty acid synthesis . in addition deficiency of a single vitamin of b complex group is rare because poor nutritional diets or malabsorption are more often associated with multiple nutritional deficiencies . follicular hyperkeratosis with keratin plugging along with epidermal hyperkertosis and acanthosis are the characteristic features of phrynoderma . further prospective case control studies investigating the levels of vit b complex vit a vit e and efa in the blood and skin and also in relation to the treatment are required to delineate the exact pathogenesis of phrynoderma .", "a 47year old man was admitted to our hospital for hematochezia of 8 hours . he denied previous medical history as well as taking any medication such as non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs . he underwent abdominal computed tomography ct which showed contrast media that filled the bowel lumen at the terminal ileum . 1 . however we failed to control the bleeding because the artery was too small for embolization treatment . he received transfusions of 10 units of packed red blood cells . for small bowel evaluation we performed sbe with a retrograde approach and found the dieulafoy lesion on the distal ileum approximately 20 cm from the ileocecal valve fig . for evaluation of other small bowel lesions we performed capsule endoscopy but could not find any abnormal lesion except the previously placed hemoclips fig . on admission blood hemoglobin level was 8.7 g dl . vital signs were stabilized and she was discharged home on the ninth admission day . six days after discharge she revisited our hospital due to recurrent fresh hematochezia . at that time blood pressure dropped to 8856 mm hg and pulse was 107 beats min . as she had underwent egd and colonoscopy we performed sbe with a retrograde approach . we found a fresh blood clot adherent on the mucosa of proximal ileum and after saline irrigation we detected the active bleeding focus at a narrow point of normal appearing mucosa fig . she was discharged home and had no evidence of recurrent gi bleeding at her 2 month follow up visit . being different in size from one another types 1a and 1b were considered angioectasia . angioectasia is a venous capillary lesion and thus is likely to be treated by endoscopic cauterization .", "this is especially important given that the populations often targeted by such campaigns may differ culturally and socioeconomically from dominant groups . similar results were attained by foster and colleagues in 2 nationally representative american surveys n 5000 . among primary care physicians weight loss discussions were more likely to be initiated by physicians who believed clients had a higher bmi than themselves . another study conducted in new york city involved a chart review and patient survey and its results suggest little focus on obesity in practice . a qualitative study on german physicians and patients views on obesity management found that doctors were concerned with a potential overemphasis on obesity . a recent debate in the canadian family physician journal has highlighted that practitioners may be developing a more critical view on the orthodoxy of advocating weight loss for every obese patient . an accompanying editorial encourages promoting self acceptance and healthy lifestyles for obese patients as weight loss is nearly impossible . based on these guidelines garrel supports urging weight loss only in obese individuals who have comorbid conditions physicians should work with obese individuals without comorbid conditions to prevent weight gain 23 24 . however they also emphasized the importance of health measures other than weight in obesity treatment and the majority advised their clients against weighing themselves . some also argued that certain larger sizes exceeded healthy limits . these relationships must be sustained in light of obesity s likely intractability and potential nonpathological nature . a greater understanding of clinicians and obese patients health perspectives perceptions and priorities over the life course is paramount for achieving these aims . a greater awareness of the stigma obese individuals encounter in day to day life as well as in the healthcare system is of particular importance to improve health and quality of life . examining these issues in depth is essential to rectify a social justice issue that has immense health and quality of life implications for a significant population . this discrimination is particularly notable among heavier individuals bmi 35 kg m 40 of whom reported experiencing discrimination in the american 1995 96 national midlife development survey . awareness of these sentiments may make it especially difficult for obese individuals to find adequate medical care . as this work is generated from within a biomedical institution it is presumed to be unquestionably objective and lacking in any moralizing political or ideological thrust . it also disqualifies concerns of how this research may affect or be affected by antifat bias . often these values are related and presumed to be unique to modern life such as diminished quality family time or the slothful nature of the current generation of children . child health prevention programs reliant on this framing may risk stigmatizing disempowering and harming children rather than on trying to understand the children s own perspectives . unfortunately this emphasis has not significantly affected antifat attitudes 28 29 . this discrimination has spread to previously nonstigmatizing nations . in addition to referring to obesity as an epidemic or crisis 2 31 an even more extreme figurative device is employing military metaphors . interventions designed to ameliorate childhood obesity have also been implicated in the development of eating disorders 4449 . muennig and colleagues found that the difference between ideal weight and actual weight had a stronger effect on mentally and physically unhealthy days than bmi in american adults suggesting that body dissatisfaction may have a potent impact on health over and above objective fatness . additionally there is qualitative evidence that weight loss efforts and concomitant lifestyle dynamic and emotional changes may result in dissolutions of friendships . monaghan conducted ethnography on male members of a united kingdom slimming club and explored the effects of stigma on their lives . while one account may suit a particular context a different account may be more useful in different situations 56 58 . for example this may involve stigma impeding life chances financial and life opportunities and the fulfillment of individual or familial role functions 59 60 . clinical trials of haes lifestyle interventions have demonstrated improvements in psychosocial clinical physiological and behavioral measures independent of weight loss . a variety of issues have been raised by these scholars and include the use of terms such as epidemic or crisis in referring to obesity the moralization of a presumed health issue and resultant ethical and stigmatizing implications of interventions and messaging and the dominant obesity discourse s effects on individuals bodily understandings 2 32 3648 5658 6268 . a focus today on stigmatized populations such as obese persons would draw upon emerging strengths in anthropology including the utilization of anthropology in social critique and the development of critical ethnography . further investigations into the experience of weight stigma for men women and children are necessary to grapple with a source of discrimination which can be life and health damaging but has attracted limited attention and censure . applied social science can enhance obese individuals quality of life by providing a greater understanding and problematization of taken for granted assumptions regarding obese individuals health lives and lifestyles . this epitomizes what rabinow views as a particularly salient and novel area for anthropological exploration . the problematization of serious speech acts and practices things and classifications . anthropological experimentation in these areas could move aspects of a culture from being viewed as natural to contingent and finally from a reflexive perspective 70 p. 67 . applied social scientists particularly those with access to health practitioner and policy related audiences may be especially valuable in this research endeavor with respect to disseminating findings and facilitating progress . critical ethnography could also be conducted within existing prevention programs to identify successful sensitive or problematic components of existing programs . facilitating the collaboration of partnerships between patient providers and policy makers would be of great value . it may open the doors to previously nonconsidered structural reforms and the provision of holistic local health needs . furthermore society deems them as culpable for their presumed poor health and for straining the health care system . given applied social scientists dedication to understanding emic perspectives and expertise in in depth exploratory methods such as ethnography they may be particularly suited to aid in this pursuit .", "celiac disease cd is a common autoimmune disorder estimated to affect approximately 1 of the us population . as with many chronic diseases quality improvement approaches can be applied to populations of patients with cd to standardize care and track outcomes . effectively identifying and tracking outcomes of these cohorts of patients however the development of cd patient registries often requires significant resources including practitioners informatics teams and administrative support . a laboratory test result was marked with a nominal value of either high 20 eu ml or normal 20 eu ml . an upper endoscopy egd may also be performed then resulted in a text based pathology report which could be used for nlp analysis . these nine key phrases which were all converted to lower cases included brunner s gland hyperplasia flattening villi intraepithelial lymphocytes marsh gland stage marsh lesion marsh s3 lesion shortened villi villous blunting and villous atrophy . each key phrase was first converted to a binary variable with the value of one indicating the phrase existed in the pathology report and 0 otherwise . a list of common words such as the skipped . the four classifier categories included bayes function based lazy model and tree classifiers . this was another main reason we only chose to experiment with three classifiers rather than all available classifiers from each category . for example for libsvm the standard algorithm of regularized c support vector classification was selected as well as the default radial kernel type table 2 . resulting in twelve experiments for each variable configuration . appropriately selected features could minimize the chance of overfitting as well as reduce feature redundancy and training time in the face of high dimensional variables . a typical feature selection process included two separate steps available in the weka tool we used . there is not a single rule of thumb for choosing the best possible feature selection method . after performing several experiments we found the default feature selection method in weka worked the best for us . the cfssubseteval feature evaluation model ranks the features based on their correlation with the class while minimizing the redundancy of variables . the underlying feature search model was the best first feature search model which searches the attribute space by allowing backtracking . detailed discussion on cfssubseteval and best first is beyond the scope of this paper and we recommend researchers to refer to the original work from the original authors . auc was a commonly used metric for machine learning based evolution as a chance corrected measure and independent of class distributions . in addition to auc we also reported precision recall f1 and kappa . precision recall and f1 were classic machine learning measures for evaluating overall accuracy with 1 being the best and 0 being the worst for predicting positive cases . the kappa score measured the level of agreement between the user and the classifier with 1 being complete agreement and 0 being complete disagreement . a list of common words such as the of is etc . skipped . during the process of converting documents into n gram features term frequency inverse document frequency tf idf tf idf is a data transformation method commonly used in text classification to show the importance of a word to a document in a collection of documents . as this study mainly focused on using clinical variables for celiac classification we did not include any demographic variables in building classifiers table 3 . among all twelve classification models we experimented with the libsvm was found to be the top performer in five experiments experiments 3 4 5 6 8 followed by logistic model in two experiments experiments 1 7 and nave bayes in one experiment experiment 2 . despite the slightly lower performance the nave bayes model was much faster than other models in terms of model building and model evaluation time . in our case it only took nave bayes a few seconds to build and evaluate the model in 10fold cross validation while it took a few minutes for libsvm and logistic model to finish in the case of using all 4000 features . for example automatically generated n grams such as celiac and abdominal pain were directly relevant features to cd but were not initially on our clinicians list . comparison of user defined high risk phrases and automated key phrases some of the provided high risk features were not included in our automatically selected feature list such as the phrase of marsh lesion converted to lower case for processing . in addition by combining both clinical and text features altogether classification accuracy and kappa score could be further improved kappa of 0.78 f1 of 0.92 and auc of 0.94 . although new to the task of cd classification feature selection methods have been found widely used in other disease classification studies including alzheimer s disease and asthma . however this result may be problem dependent . it is therefore important to make sure the initial icd9 code assignment will include as many high risk cases as possible . given our experience it was likely that some methods may further improve accuracy while others may even lower the accuracy . finally for most machine learning algorithms we experimented only the default configuration was used for classification .", "it is not known if these women should be recalled for cultures

bv vaginal candidiasis vc and trichomoniasis are the three infections most commonly associated with vaginal discharge 1 . a number of studies have indicated the association of bv with postoperative complications after gynecologic surgery as well as pregnancy complications 25 . all women received their laboratory results in written form and results were explained during a consultation . cervical smear samples based on the conventional method were prepared with a spatula and fixed on glass slides and were stained with the papanicolaou technique . statistical significance was analyzed using statistical package for social sciences spss software version 17 . tv n 2 0.4 was shown to have a low prevalence among our patients table 1 . although there was no significant relation between the presence of inflammation and bv the severity of inflammation in specimen was significantly increased in association with bv p 0.001 . however this rate was 18 in the study in hamedan 11 8.5 among indian women 16 and 19 in the african study 13 . a probable reason for these variations could be differences in pap sampling quality and cytologists skill . also it was confirmed by heller s study on 400 pap samples which concluded that bv diagnosis should be considered at the presence of tv in pap smears 2 . as burke et al 22 in their study on 256 women found an evidence of inflammation in 9.7 of smears and genital tract infection in 29.2 of their participants overall . the use of other diagnostic methods may be probably more valuable than conventional pap smear for evaluation of tv among

discussion suggests there are several hypothetical reasons why the sglt2 transporter represents an opportune target for managing blood glucose . however the challenge is to establish therapeutic utility while demonstrating an acceptable safety profile . a detailed summary of clinical findings has recently been published.55 the mechanism of action of sglt2 inhibitors predicts a beneficial effect but the long term glucose lowering capacity in a clinical setting may not impart significant reductions in hba1c . clearly blocking glucose reabsorption permits the clearance of glucose from the body and thus must eventually serve to reduce levels of plasma glucose . clearly clinical development programs will need to address the concern of a possible increased risk of uti . although the sglt2 inhibitors mechanism of action would make them suitable for initial monotherapy in patients with early stage t2 dm it is unlikely they would be considered at this stage . however as explained earlier the advantage of this may be minimal in patients achieving a degree of glycemic control . by promoting an escape mechanism for glucose sglt2 inhibitors introduce a new mode to the control of t2 dm . insulin dependent therapies become less effective with the development of insulin resistance andor deterioration of cell function particularly in patients with low insulin resistance high glucose or poorly controlled disease . by increasing excretion of glucose sglt2 inhibitors offer an opportunity to increase calorie loss in t2 dm patients most of whom are overweight . in a clinical setting it would be easy to overcome any benefits that patients may derive from sglt2 inhibition if they perceived the drug as a means of acclimatized to higher levels of plasma glucose would experience a marked change in appetite with substantial loss of glucose calories.67 one final issue is that for these drugs to work they need to be delivered to the epithelial luminal surface of the nephron requiring them to be cleared by the glomerulus . consequently their efficacy may be affected in those instances when the functioning of the kidney is impaired for example in diabetic nephropathy . experience will lead to better understanding of which patients are likely to respond best and under what circumstances .", "the protocol was approved by the institutional review board or

being treated with hemodiafiltration hdf.1 online hdf has been suggested as a possible cost effective alternative compared to standard hd mainly due to its superior middle molecule clearance resulting from the combination of diffusion and convection solute removal mechanisms . accordingly there is a need for a new cost effectiveness evaluation . as a consequence and because differences in total water consumption are negligible it was possible to limit the analysis to the costs of disposables blood lines dialyzers and equipment only . . contradicting results have been reported on the difference in qol related to hf hd and hdf . mazairac et al8 estimated higher scores with euroqol 5d for patients on hdf compared with hd . as recommended by the economic analysis guidelines19 an annual discount rate of 3.5 for both costs and benefits was selected and changes in results as a function of different values of these parameters were considered . consequently the quality and quantity of information available can be reflected in the probability distributions assigned to each input parameter in the model.20 several monte carlo simulations were performed also for patients with different risk profiles by age patients aged 40 50 and 60 years sex and diabetic status.2122 for the sake of simplicity the cohort of simulated 50year old male patients were selected as the reference population for the analysis . as discussed in the next section we found similar results in all age subgroups with identical conclusions in terms of cost effectiveness therefore we used this cohort to briefly recap the main results of our analysis . on the basis of these simulations it was possible to derive the probability of cost effectiveness given different thresholds as shown in figure 3 . by applying a 0 or a 5 discount rate for both costs and effects 50year old male patient icer decreased to 6676qaly and increased to 6960qaly respectively confirming the robustness of the estimations . a further analysis was performed to investigate the importance of the qualitative component of the qalys qol compared to the quantitative one life years . even an infinite value of the threshold would not lead to a probability of cost effectiveness 65 data not shown . it must be stressed that the purpose itself of an economic decision model is to synthesize all the relevant evidence in order to make a sense of it and inform the decision about the adoption of a new technology in an uncertain context.15 we have indeed identified the relevant studies involving the therapies under assessment and we have included all the uncertainty in our parameter estimates without neglecting any relevant information in the literature . additionally the low crude mortality rate observed in the membrane permeability outcome study may produce results not completely transferrable to ordinary nontrial participating patients . nevertheless there is still a great variety of patients and treatment modalities characteristics among the studies . as a consequence a relative risk based on a random effects model has been used which makes the estimate of the pooled effect more conservative and takes into account the clinical heterogeneity among the single studies . as the eshol study provided the most positive results in favor of hdf concerns about the overestimation of the reduction in mortality could be raised . additionally the lack of qol coefficients related to hf hd forced the use of data from a comparison of hdf with low flux hd.8 uncertainty around results is high but this is typical in this kind of analyses neglecting some available evidence only because of its uncertainty would contrast with the comprehensive nature of an economic model .", "a biomarker is defined as a

newly formed disulphide which is coupled with a depletion of the reduced gluthatione pool . although both the upr and autophagy can function independently from each other recent reports show that they may be interlinked and share the functional duality of exerting both a cytoprotective under basal or metabolic stress conditions and cytocidial activity after acute cellular damage . additional mechanisms include a general translational shutdown as well as the degradation of a select group of secretory mrnas and proteins that are delayed at the translocon a process also known as pre emptive quality control . consistent with this xbp1 deficient cells were found to be more susceptible to exogenous agents causing oxidative stress such as h2o2 and parthenolide concomitant with a reduced expression of several antioxidant enzymes including catalase and thioredoxin trx1 . although the molecular mechanism underlying the differential function of the unspliced xbp1u and spliced xbp1s products of xbp1 is still elusive and may involve the binding and regulation of selected targets dependent on their relative abundance in different cell types this study highlights a new role for xbp1 in ros signaling independent of ire1 rnase activity . although ire1 displays intrinsic kinase activity there are no other substrates known thus far than ire1 itself . depending on the cellular context activation of jnk can either allow the cells to adapt to er stress by initiating autophagy or as discussed further promote apoptosis in response to persistent or irrecoverable er stress . both isoforms of atf6 atf6 and atf6 are present in all cell lines as type ii transmembrane er proteins . additionally a recent study shows that atf6 also contributes in an xpb1s independent manner to lipid biogenesis and er expansion an er stress response which was thought to be predominantly mediated by the irei pathway . bid bim bad are key regulators of mitochondrial apoptosis 41 42 . they function as gatekeepers antiapoptotic bcl2 or gatecrashers proapoptotic bax bak of the outer mitochondrial membrane . a constellation of er localized bcl2 family members including bax bak bik nbk and bcl2 has been shown to be engaged in the control of er ca homeostasis 4446 for an extensive review see 13 47 . clearly further studies are required to shed more light into the mechanisms regulating ire1 signal transduction . however the molecular elements of this switch are still elusive . bip or proapoptotic i.e. for example genetic deletion of perk or interference with eif2 phosphorylation impairs cell survival 58 59 and tumor growth under hypoxia while artificially increasing perk activity increases cell survival . however lin et al . an interesting molecular switch between the prosurvival and prodeath functions of the perk pathway could involve the human orthologue of the drosophila tribble protein trb3 a downstream transcriptional target of chop . . a mechanism was proposed wherein trb3 exerts a negative feedback on chop during mild er stress allowing the cell to adapt to er stress 72 73 . initiation of autophagy relies on the formation of an isolation membrane i m at the so called preautophagosomal site . another important regulator of tsc2 is the amp activated protein kinase ampk which phosphorylates tsc2 in a different residue than akt leading to activation of tsc12 inactivation of rheb and inhibition of mtorc1 . accumulation of pip3 seems to be crucial for the recruitment of autophagy proteins such as atg18wipi1 to the i m which is important for atg9 trafficking and therefore for the initiation of the autophagic process . among the different partners of vps34 beclin1 has a bh3only domain that permits the interaction of this protein with the antiapoptotic proteins bcl2 and bcl xl . atg14 and uvrag are also interactors of vps34 although their presence in the class iii pi3k complex seems to be mutually exclusive 87 103 104 . finally atg12 is attached to an internal lysine of atg5 in a process that does not seem to require an e3 ligase protein . accordingly autophagy plays a dual role in cancer . as described above the accumulation of unfolded proteins triggers the upr thus promoting the inhibition of general protein synthesis as well as the increased translation of several transcription factors that enhance the expression of er stress genes see the previous sections for further details . accordingly pkr dependent eif2 phosphorylation modulates autophagy in response to viral infection . activation of the ire1 arm of the er stress response has also been shown to regulate autophagy . as discussed above beclin1 is associated to the vps34 and plays a very important role in the regulation of autophagy see below figure 2 . ampk is considered an important energy sensor that becomes activated upon atp cellular depletion or phosphorylation by different kinases . activation of dapk upon er stress relies on the dephosphorylation of an inhibitory autophosphorylation site of the kinase by a pp2a phosphatase which suggests that additional er stress activated signals apart from ca release are required to stimulate the proautophagic activity of the kinase . a wide array of conventional and experimental chemotherapeutic agents has been shown to stimulate er stress and activation of upr along with autophagy in cancer cells . activation of this er stress response induces the up regulation of several genes including the stress regulated protein p8 and its downstream targets atf4 and chop and the pseudokinase trb3 which are required for the stimulation of autophagy in response to cannabinoid action . since singlet oxygen will not migrate more than a fraction of a micron from the site of formation as a result photodamage can be quite specific . agents found to be clinically useful were reported to show affinity for the er mitochondria lysosomes or combinations of these sites . a well studied paradigm of er localizing dye is hypericin a naturally occurring phototoxin with promising applications in bladder cancer . bortezomib ps341 or velcade distinguishes itself from other proteasome inhibitors as it specifically inhibits the 26s proteasome by selectively blocking its chymotryptic activity . however inhibition of nfb alone could not fully account for the antitumor effect by bortezomib suggesting additional pathways being involved . intriguingly for example accumulation of unfolded proteins in neurodegenerative diseases may activate a protective autophagy response .", "cumulative data gathered from

and even end stage renal failure . endoscopic injection is frequently used now as a firstline treatment because it involves less pain and a shorter hospitalization period and leaves no scar in contrast to open reimplantation . however when an injection treatment fails open ureteral reimplantation should be considered for treating persistent vur . among them 64 underwent open reimplantation as a primary procedure group a and 17 underwent it after failed endoscopic injection group b . all patients were classed in terms of preoperative reflux grade using voiding cystourethrography vcug . reflux grade was classed as grades i v according to the international classification system of the international reflux study committee . 20.0 ibm co. armonk student t tests and chi square tests were applied to compare the parameters of each group p values 0.05 were considered statistically significant . the male to female ratios of groups a and b were 4321 and 125 respectively . however group a still had more patients with high grade reflux after endoscopic surgery than did group b p0.020 . however this difference was not statistically significant p0.107 . at 6 months after surgery resolution of vur was found in all patients who underwent vcug . as seen above endoscopic treatment of children with vur had many advantages and a high success rate but there were also many failures especially in the children with more severe reflux . it is generally assumed that a secondary operation after failed a primary procedure is more difficult and has more complications . a similar study by moreira pinto et al sencan et al . in a survey 80 of parents preferred endoscopic treatment rather than antibiotic prophylaxis or open surgery when given the option of any of the three treatment modalities . however there were no significant differences in operation time postoperative complications hospitalization period or surgical success rates between open ureteral reimplantation surgery after failed endoscopic injection for vur and primary open reimplantation .", "although there are exceptions to learn from generally speaking european health and social services are fragmented and poorly equipped to take care of patients with composite needs . each actor s capabilities are known and respected . a combination of monetary and non monetary incentives exists in order to create lasting mutually acceptable solutions . plans are made and are to be followed and the intended change takes place as a direct consequence . from this we learn that when there is no motivation to renew the system when there is an inability to innovate the survival of the system is threatened . a few years ago concepts such as the knowledge society and learning organizations and the associated mechanisms and technologies the internet e mail mobile phones and digital imaging were all unknown . davis coined the expression any time any place when he describes how time and space restrictions this has given us enormous possibilities to communicate to become connected to network . as we advance in the knowledge society the basic assumptions behind much of what is taught and practiced in the name of management are now hopelessly out of date . a cas consists of several subsystems called agents which act in dependence of one another . . prominent figures in the field include nobel laureates ilya prigogine in chemistry 26 27 and murray gell mann in theoretical physics . according to augustinsson one way to explain the phenomenon of complexity is by reference to the possibility to apply routines to carry out a particular task . although more research is needed to achieve greater understanding of complex adaptive systems and to strengthen the knowledge base for action we do have a growing number of examples that show the cas concept gaining ground within the health and social services . emergency treatment is a clear example of independent agents interacting locally with other independent agents . a common vision easy to understand and to communicate there is no external constructor no superior centrally located source to govern the design of the system . today digital imaging as a diagnostic technology brings together the specialist radiologist and the primary practitioner treating the patient in a way that was virtually impossible previously . and thereby generate new possibilities of professional interaction and patient involvement as well as new forms of inter organizational collaboration . in practice we assume that any provider s top down attempt at specifying tasks will risk more complexity for the patient . so for example a hospital inpatient can at the same time be a part both of the hospital system and another system at his workplace . for example in general terms there is a positive feedback loop between income and consumption in an economy . general criticisms of the cas approach coming from practitioners concern a lack of recommendations as to how they should behave being part of a cas . a certain level of system inertia may also develop over time . for a long time effective organizations have been looked upon like well oiled machines . and an important part of complexity science is the complex adaptive system cas . a common vision easy to understand and to communicate was created to connect the two groups . an important discussion is about how the top management in fact executes its steering function .", "almost all the intracellular proteins are passed through principally similar processes from the synthesis to their degradation in general . as figure 1 shows the intracellular proteins are synthesized as pre promature complex in polysomes and prepart is removed cotranslationally and then the promature parts are translocated into golgi apparatus and then glycosylated by mannose rich sugar . biological merit of post translational processing and modifications of proteins are possible considerations . as figure 4a shows using immunodouble gold particle staining cathepsin b small gold particle and cathepsin h large gold particle are located clearly in different lysosomes . cathepsin b is translated as 17 amino acids of prepart 62 amino acids of pro part and 252 amino acids of mature part 12 13 . the initiation of degradation is started from the 177th nicking bond by cysteine protease . intracellular protein degradation autophagosome formation is regulated by nutritional and hormonal conditions . as figure 5 shows bone metabolism is consisted of functional balances between osteoblastic cell function and osteoclastic cell function . another secretary group having high molecular weight repeated low molecular cystatins is kininogen family in serum . because their localizations and biological functions is quite different . the participation of protein kinase c in the phosphorylation of cystatin was also confirmed using specific inhibitor of protein kinase c hidaka h7 inhibited the incorporation of p into cystatin . in the envelop the phosphorylated cystatin was conjugated with filaggrin linker sediment peptide which is rich in glutamine residues mediated by epidermal transglutaminase in the presence of calcium and yield a high molecular weight protein skin fiber as shown in figure 10 . as figure 8 shows n terminus of cystatins was inserted into the substrate binding pocket of cathepsins the glutathionated or the dimmer form were unable to insert into the binding pocket of cathepsins . as figure 7b shows using cell of pancreas the cystatin is located in insulin secretion particles therefore cystatin is secreted with insulin in the pancreas .", "a 39year old female presented to the clinic with dysarthria of six months duration . clinical

peripheral neuropathy huntington s chorea parkinson s disease multiple sclerosis myasthenia gravis or muscle disease.4 the second may be attributable to congenital traumatic inflammatory tumors or post operative lesions of the vocal cords . dysarthria due to hypothyroidism had been reported only once previous to this case.3 the pathophysiology of dysarthria in hypothyroidism can be explained by edematous swelling of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal structures in combination with macroglossia.3 it has been shown that macroglossia in hypothyroidism is caused by a thickening of the epithelial tissue.6 these changes can also explain the choking and the dysphagia which this patient experienced .", "apart from this the greater function of biceps brachi muscle whose tendon is enshrined in bicipital groove is suppination flexion and screwing biomechanical movements . a radiological study recommended that the entire length of the bg be examined to determine the osseous anatomy of the groove . it indicates that width of bg in most of the north indian population is 8 mm . in the present study depth of bg more than 3 mm and depth ranging 46 mm are 98 and 96 of humeri respectively as against 90 and 86 in the study of cone et al . from their radiographic interpretations observed this ridge in 50 of cases and reported that it was not pathologically significant . apart from this if the movements of tendon are not free in narrow or in presence of bony spurs in bg during biomechanical movements of shoulder joint its constant fraying might give rise to pathologies of biceps tendon . 17 mm were often shallow . a shallow intertubercular groove is vulnerable to impingement damage and subluxation 37 40 . limitations of josheph s study subjective qualitative definition of shallowness and narrowness . abboud et al . acute inflammatory and chronic degenerative alterations causing partial complete rupture and subluxation dislocation can be found in the long head of the biceps tendon . as the lengths of medial and lateral walls decrease the instability increases and the tendon is likely to be damaged .", "saws is the competent agency under the state council in charge

penalty . in this study the data covered most industries except the military forces and private enterprises . additionally we checked statistical year book of road traffic accidents and public literature to supplement information and details . the analysis was conducted using the registered data with more than 10 deaths per incident . major accidents in transportation involved victim who was the operator passenger or a pedestrian stuck in or on the side of the road . after extraction details including types of the event year region number of deaths and injuries causes of accidents

and deaths dropped by 52.0 and 66.6 from the peak year 2005 to 2012 respectively . 1 . the deeper the color in the region the higher number of accidents and deaths occurred . as indicated in table 2 more than 80 of major work safety accident related deaths occurred in mining and transportation and both of them declined in recent years . 2 shows major work safety accidents and deaths in relation to their geographic distribution . as part of this move chinese government has also strengthened the penalties for fatal major work safety . as the formulation and implementation of the regulations provinces have made great improvements in preventing serious and major accidents . according to zhang et al . 12 the risk of death was 6.1 per million populations in work safety in whole country which was higher than other countries 18 . among these accidents mining and transportation contributed to the majority accounting for more than 89 of all . in transportation section data analysis revealed that one major road traffic accident occurred every 10 days on average in china while the average number of deaths in aviation was 49.5 . fortunately with the provisions on the prevention of coal mine accidents at the end of 2005 27 and the closure of half of the operating mines in 2006 the death rate per million tons showed a rapid decline since 2006 26 and the number of mining accidents and

then soaked in denaturation solution 1.0 m nacl and 0.4 m naoh for 1 hr . however we observed no differences between the wild type and deletion mutant data not shown . here we tested the effect of cop deletion on sensitivity to environmental stresses caused by treatment of the fungi with several drugs that are known to exert adverse effects on cellular processes related to the stress response . because the effect of c sources and hypoxic treatment was tested in the presence of 0.1 sodium nitrate as a nitrogen source we tested 0.2 yeast extract which preferentially induces sexual development and found that the defect in fruiting body formation on 1 glucose without hypoxic treatment was recovered in anea deletion strain data not shown . although further experiments are required to determine the underlying mechanisms our results suggested that cop plays a role in sexual development in a. nidulans under certain environmental conditions possibly by affecting cytokinesis andor

technique creates the possibility of observing major brain metabolites that contributes to the major resonances seen in h mr spectra of the brain such as n acetylaspartate naa creatine phosphocreatine cr choline containing compounds cho and myo inositiols ins 1 3 . the aim of this study was to evaluate the local metabolic changes for the primary motor cortex m1 and supplementary motor area sma in the affected hemisphere ah and unaffected hemisphere uh according to their axonal injuries at the level of the internal capsule . the m1sma of the ah and the uh were studied using h mrs on 9 patients 4 men and 5 women mean age 54 yr range 30 70 yr right handed with documentable hemiparesis of varying severity . the hemiparesis was caused by deep intracerebral hematoma in the putamen and the thalamus because these locations are directly adjacent to the internal capsule and an intracerebral hematoma in these areas mostly brings about hemiparesis as a neurologic sequele . the h mrs study was performed on alert patients with definite hemiparesis of the extremities contralateral to the ah . to control the possible h mrs spectral change we excluded those patients that had undergone any surgical intervention or if they had a major systemic illness such as uremia . the institutional review board approved the mr study proctocol and the investigation was conducted in full compliance with accepted standards for research involving humans . using the stimulated echo acquisition mode steam sequence after water suppression with chemical shift selective chess rf pulse and dephasing gradients 11 12 . a standard head coil was used for the routine neurological and research imaging sequences with image guided single voxel spectroscopic acquisition . a 6.4 ml volume in the cortex was

procedure was used for optimizing the magnetic field homogeneity over the entire volume of interest that was detected by the receiver coil and focused on the water signal . after an autoprescan the typical line width full length at half maximum fwhm was usually 2 to 4 hz and the raw data was processed using a sage data analysis package ge medical systems . the post processing was done using zerofilling to 4k and apodization filtering was used to improve either snr or resolution andor to reduce the truncation artifacts . fourier transformation zero order phase correction and phase absorption spectra were performed directly along with baseline corrections or resolution enhancement . the peak areas were obtained from the spectra using the marquardt algorithm to fit a lorentzian gaussian peak type 13 . after the data was processed by our selected personal blinded to the patient s histories and conditions the results were expressed as meanssd of the naa cr ratio and the cho cr ratios . the metabolite ratios in the ah and uh and the controls values were compared for significant differences using the paired t test assuming equal variance and independent sample t test . probability values of less than 0.05 were considered significant and values less than 0.01 were considered highly significant . the naa cr ratios of m1 in the ah and uh were 1.080.12 1.500.17 respectively . however the naa cr ratios of m1 measured in the uh showed no differences when compared with the ratios of normal volunteers p0.115 . however when compared with the sma of the controls the naa cr ratios of sma in the ah and uh showed significant differences p0.05 . h mrs has been used in attempting better qualification of the brain damage caused by stroke . h mrs allows the in vivo measurement of n acetyl containing compounds creatine choline and lactate . further naa synthesis in vitro has been shown to occur in an energy dependent manner and this is reduced by mitochondrial inhibitors 20 . decrease in naa have been shown to correlate with disability in multiple sclerosis 22 suggesting that axonal injury is responsible for the chronic functional impairment in this disease . 9 found no clear relationship between the level of naa and the patient s clinical outcome . 10 found that naa reduction correlated with the barthel index score at discharge . 21 has pointed out that the above mentioned studies regarding h mrs and outcome after stroke measured the naa loss from the center of infarcted region and thus these naa losses were not representative of the total neuronal injury . the exact pathophysiologic mechanism of naa loss in the normal appearing motor cortex is unclear . the motor pathway it is believed that there likely is a significant commonality between the two . reduced metabolism in the motor cortex has already been documented in a pet study dealing the ischemic stroke 25 . in a pet study of 10 patients following recovery from striatocapsular infarction the comparison of regional cerebral blood flow rcbf maps for patients at rest and normal subjects revealed the significantly lower regional cerebral blood flow in the basal ganglia thalamus sensorimotor insular and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices in the brainstem and in the ipsilateral cerebellum in patients contralateral to the side of the recovered hand 25 . these researchers suggest that the cause of decreased rcbf in these areas as a functional deactivation although structural changes at a microscopic level due to transsynaptic or retrograde degeneration can not be excluded . 3 evaluated the motor cortex by using in vivo h mrs in patients with incomplete spinal cord injury who showed a good motor function recovery . however there are several differences in the patients characteristics the methods used for mrs location of voxels etc . in a study by puri et al . in terms of the technical aspects of h mrs puri and his co workers located the voxel in the centrum semiovale and they used the technique of chemical shift imaging . at this time it is not clear whether the naa cr ratio of the ah would increase according to the recovery from hemiparesis in intracerebral hematoma . clinical studies suggest that the sma may contribute to the return of motor function after stroke 29 30 . however the sma have striking bilateral influences upon both proximal and distal musculatures in primates and cortical projections from the sma are ipsilateral to areas 4 6 and 7 and to the contralateral sma 26 28 . considering that the sma has bilateral influence on motor function we speculate that unilateral injury to the motor pathway might induce metabolic changes in the bilateral sma by a possible retrograde degeneration .", "conversion disorder has one or

facilitate access to needed services . fifth because dph administers a full range of public health medical and long term care services it has been able in some important ways to coordinate care within the public sector and with the private sector . finally the number of aids cases although large relative to other communities did not overwhelm the service system in the early years so that informal and decentralized strategies could succeed . in 1986 various observers began questioning whether the pool of volunteers on which the san francisco model depended could be sustained arno 1986 lee 1987 jenna 1987 and whether dedicated professionals could continue to coordinate and manage care as an adjunct to their direct service responsibilities . as more community hospitals including the kaiser hospital physicians home care agencies and other providers became involved with aids care informal approaches to case coordination became much more difficult . although this hospital and post hospital period may well be the most difficult for many pwa s for most it represents 10 percent or less of the duration of the illness . at the same time that kaiser has become a major provider of aids care it has sought to avoid designation as carrier of choice for pwa s and the adverse selection that might follow from favorable publicity . case management services are offered to pwa s and persons with severe arc . because the kaiser service package is limited e.g. blue cross prudential aetna and other third party insurers share an interest in limiting hospital use and managing medical care to reduce costs . few insurers in california are planning to develop aids specific case management efforts outside their broader mechanisms for addressing catastrophic illness . at the state level the california department of health services is seeking a home and community based waiver for medi cal eligible pwa s and strong provisions for local centralized case management are included in that pending application . both initiatives have stimulated planning for new approaches to case assessment coordination and monitoring . although san francisco has embraced what has come to be known as a brokering model of case management under which case management involves gaining access to and coordinating existing services communities with fewer available aids services have adopted a direct service model wright sklebar and heiman 1987 in which case managers not only plan for care but directly provide those services not otherwise available to pwa s . bachelor or masters level . case management has succeeded in san francisco because many of the services needed by pwa s were available for case managers to coordinate . although many factors besides case management explain the shorter length of stay in san francisco scitovsky cline and lee 1986 arno and hughes 1987 there remains reason to believe that in other communities aids may prove the exception to prior findings on the limited impact of case management by demonstrating that these services can shorten hospital stays and thus reduce the overall costs of caring for persons with aids .", "although obesity is not the unique problem in metabolic syndrome this is becoming more common due to a rise in obesity rates among adults . over the last few years the number of people with diabetes mellitus has increased massively raising prevalence worldwide and does not focus on the western societies . in the economically advanced countries the increase will be about 50 in 2030 so it has become one of the most important public health challenges globally . although great advances have been made in understanding the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of t2d these have still not been fully elucidated . a classical paradigm has been the fact that the more adipose tissue the higher the prevalence of metabolic diseases and it is this relationship that has interested researchers . lipogenesis encompasses the processes of fatty acid synthesis and triglyceride synthesis and takes place in both the liver and in adipose tissue . although in early obesity there is an increase in lipogenic gene expression to store fat rapidly in long term obese subjects this expression decreases perhaps due to a late adaptive process aimed at limiting further development of fat mass . a possible explanation for this reversal is that once the storage capacity of the adipocytes is reached the cells reduce their ability to synthesize additional fatty acids following a natural inhibitory feed back process . many factors are involved in this action although we will focus on those our research team has been working on figure 1 in the last years some of them are widely known others are shown as a novel approach . morbidly obese patients and patients with diabetes have a lower expression of ppar2 mrna in comparison with morbidly obese insulin sensitive patients both in vat and muscle . another protein recently studied is zinc2 glycoprotein zag a protein expressed in mature adipocytes and in vat and sat and which is involved in body weight control through its lipid mobilizing activity via interaction with 3adrenoreceptors suggesting a role in lipid catabolism . stearoyl coa desaturase1 scd1 which is an endoplasmic reticulum bound enzyme that converts different saturated fatty acids into mono unsaturated fatty acids . a recent collaboration has found an adaptive response to compensate the antilipogenic effect associated with ir maintaining lipid desaturation through preferential scd1 regulation and facilitating fat storage in adipose tissue . another example of up regulated molecules in obesity is rab18 which is a gtpase that has been found to regulate intracellular membrane bidirectional trafficking of lipids in lipid droplets it is involved in the mechanism to release lipids from lipid droplets in adipocytes . adipocytes are the main units in adipose tissue and this tissue is considered to control the whole body metabolism so dysregulation can have huge consequences for health . adipose tissue dysfunction is thought to be the major factor leading to whole body ir . conversely endogenous inhibitors of wnt signaling were found to promote the generation of adipocytes . accordingly in collaboration with our team lagathu et al . further weight gain results in sfrp1 levels falling back to the same values as lean subjects and limiting adipogenesis through increased wntcatenin signaling compromising further adipose tissue expansion figure 3 . ho mscs from obese subjects have greater senescence and this senescence is increased as the degree of obesity rises . two of the main families involved in apoptosis are the caspases and b cell lymphoma 2 bcl2 proteins . a multifunctional proapoptotic cytokine belonging to the tnf superfamily named tnf like weak inducer of apoptosis tweak controls many cellular activities and has emerged as a new player in the inflammatory process . moreover by binding to trail r2 trail activates the cleavage of caspase8 and caspase3 which in turn cleaves and inactivates ppar. however in hypertrophy the increase in vascularization does not happen in parallel . in our laboratory much interest has been generated after finding that morbidly obese subjects with low insulin resistance had higher adipose tissue vegf a levels than obese subjects with high insulin resistance hypothesizing that upregulation of vegf a in adipose tissue could have a relationship with ir believing that its upregulation is a compensatory mechanism that replaces the reduction in vegf b vegf c and vegf d . but lipogenesis is not the only process involved other crucial processes for the normal function of the adipose tissue are adipogenesis apoptosis and angiogenesis necessary processes to help in the adipose tissue expansion in order to avoid future metabolic disturbances caused by the excess of fatty acids . however it has been noticed that morbidly obese patients have this process endangered in the same way that occurs with caspases and bcl2 proteins or tweak and trail concerning to apoptosis or with the vegf family in the case of angiogenesis which are also deregulated in morbidly obese patients and to the increase of fat . a hot topic for example is the relationship with the gut microbiota nowadays there is a growing interest in elucidating how these microorganisms can help or aggravate the problem . another recent theory is that hypoxia could be a new potential risk factor for the chronic inflammation in obesity . a better understanding of the role of each of the parts of this orchestra will give us the capacity to understand the relationships and therefore the way and the level to act to obtain the best response .", "cases in whom ipso is the primary clinical feature are typically associated with connective tissue diseases . acute lupus pneumonitis alp is an uncommon pulmonary manifestation of

other two groups . furthermore the present study is a cross sectional study the associations between the demographic factors and psychological morbidity or qol are hard to compare with other studies . although this was not specific to individual domains this overall finding was similar to the results found for the chq . further study of sleep in military personnel and its relation to mood and health status should be considered . first there were very few female subjects and the sex related differences could not be studied well in such a military environment . although our questionnaire return rate was 60 there were many units that were unwilling to receive it . finally this is a cross sectional study the relationship between demographic factors and qol is hard to determine and needs further longitudinal studies . in addition to the combat readiness of our forces disaster relief is now an important task . it could be used in a war situation or during emergency mobilization and it

sputum figure 1a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid bal figure 1c lower panel and lung tissue figure 1c upper panel . however associations of free dna structures with both live and dead bacteria were noted figure 1e . cf airway nets correlated positively with levels of the proinflammatory chemokine cxcl2 figure 2d . also consistent with the data obtained from human cf lung disease samples the extent of free dna in murine cf airway fluids correlated positively with the levels of the cxcr2 ligand cxcl2 figure 3c and with pulmonary obstruction parameters fev100 figure 3d whereas no correlation was found between free dna and levels of cxcl1 or parameters of pulmonary restriction parameters data not shown . beyond these conditions nets were found in concert with platelets and monocytes to play a role in thrombus formation and deep vein thrombosis 41 42 . at this time dnase may be used with more caution since encaptured pathogens might be freed and could cause additional host damage . in addition our studies image net formation using fixation of biological samples and are thereby limited by the fact that dna structures reminiscent of netosis can not be clearly attributed to active net formation since this would require live cell imaging approaches . as cf lung disease is typically associated with chronic colonizations and infections with pseudomonas aeruginosa the effect of this pathogen on net formation has been investigated using different methodologies and modelling systems 11 13 4749 . as cf airway fluids show a low antioxidant activity and are substantially different in their biochemical properties we speculate that this particular microenvironment favors net formation . a recent study analyzing neutrophils from a patient with papillon lefevre syndrome pls lacking serine proteases showed that neutrophils from this patient failed to produce nets corroborating the concept that serine proteases particularly elastase regulate net formation 50 5254 . as there is a lack of convincing data supporting the latter hypothesis the underlying mechanistic basis for this correlation remains to be dissected in the future . approaches to interfere with net formation or net associated products such as dnases antiproteases supplementing surfactant protein d targeting histones or a combination thereof could represent promising therapeutic strategies for cf lung disease and other chronic lung diseases associated with sustained neutrophilic inflammation 38 40 43 .", "for example in terms of social integration disabled children who rely on others for an extended period of time due to a lack of independence tend to cause long term parenting stress in mothers . by assuming the role of an androgynous father fathers reduce the negative effects of gender roles by

urine protein levels greater than or less than 300 mg did not attain statistical significance . a retrospective analysis by parrish et al . he concluded that serum uric acid is a poor predictor of maternal and fetal complications in women with preeclampsia . however no studies have been reported till date regarding this and the sample size is very small to generalize the results .", "acute liver failure alf can be caused by the ingestion of mushrooms containing exceptionally powerful hepatotoxins . their toxicity reside in the thiamide bond of the sulphur atom located on the indole ring . even if phallotoxins are highly toxic to liver cells they add little to the amanita phalloides toxicity as they are not adsorbed from the intestine and do not reach the liver . about 60 of absorbed amanitin is excreted into the bile and is returned to the liver via the enterohepatic circulation 4 1115 . 2 gastrointestinal phase . 3648 h after ingestion signs of liver involvement may appear . diagnosis is based on a careful assessment of history and clinical manifestations and can be confirmed by laboratory tests . finally the identification by a mycologist of any remaining mushrooms can be crucial for diagnosis . a complete analysis of the world experience in treatment of amatoxin poisoning was published in 2002 by enjalbert et al . . detoxification procedures consist of two different approaches the reduction of intestinal absorption and enhancement of excretion . according to retrospective data most authors indicate that silibinin and n acetylcysteine nac may be effective in the management of patients with amanita phalloides poisoning 1 2 4 21 . administration of silibinin is recommended if the patient is seen within 48 hours of ingestion . infusion of the initial dose over 30 to 60 minutes rather than 15 minutes may reduce incidence of anaphylactoid reactions 33 34 . because some patients with partial hepatectomy and temporary support may have complete morphological and functional recovery of their own liver only a portion of the native liver is removed and the remainder is left in situ the transplant provides temporary assistance until the native liver recovers and the immunosuppression can be withdrawn . if the surgical procedure is performed too early the patient could have survived without impaired quality of life . because of imprecise data in the patient s records . also escudi et al . finally it should be taken into account that most of studies on the efficacy of prognostic criteria for urgent lt in patients with alf have been carried out in countries where graft is usually available within a short time . however the waiting time on the emergency transplant list if it exists may be very prolonged in other parts of the world and liver transplant may never be performed in others .", "a number of systemic conditions might predispose patients in developing endogenous endophthalmitis including diabetes mellitus cardiac

the result of cag coronary ct angiography and myocardial single photon emission computerized tomography spect . coronary pathologies were classified into 4 types according to classification of mosseri et al.2 type i lesions not related to septal branches or the atrioventricular av node type ii lesions compromising blood supply to septal branches emerging from the left anterior descending artery lad type iii lesions compromising blood supply to the av node and type iv lesions compromising blood supply both to septal branches emerging from the lad and to the av node table 1 . chicago il usa and a p0.05 was considered statistically significant . serum level of hdl c was higher in ib group 46.5610.95 mg dl vs. 40.0010.07 mg dl p0.030 whereas crp was higher in rb group 0.531.24 mg dl vs. 1.991.80 mg dl p0.014 . in contrast the rb group had 13 86.7 with ami one 6.7 with stable angina and one 6.7 without cad on admission p0.001 . 43 24.9 of 173 patients in the non ami group and 15 100.0 of 15 patients in the ami group had cad . avb was rarely reversible in the non ami group as only one of 43 patients 2.3 showed reversible avb . among 15 patients with ami 11 patients had inferior wall st segment elevation myocardial infarction stemi and 1 patient had anterior wall stemi . according to mosseri et als2 classification the number of patients with cad in the non ami group were 4 9.3 type i anatomy 9 20.9 type ii anatomy 7 16.3 type iii anatomy and 23 53.5 type iv anatomy . although we could not provide the optimal timing to confirm the reversibility of avb in each type of cad the results of this study deserve special consideration . in the remainder of individuals the av node is still supplied by the posterior interventricular artery but that artery is a branch of the left circumflex artery the coronary circulation of these individuals is considered left dominant . intraventricular conduction system is supplied by septal branches from lad especially the first septal perforator branch from proximal lad.13 this physiologic background has been supported by several studies . however revascularization of the stenosed coronary artery could not reverse conduction disturbances.56 in the present study status of cad on admission showed significant difference between the ib group and the rb group . as male gender and smoking status are distinct risk factors of cad it seems that gender and smoking status are not major components in the reversibility of avb . by screening all patients with new onset avb who visited our hospital majority of patients had no evidence of cad while only 2 patients presented with unstable angina . second this was an observational retrospective study based on the electronic medical records . no standardized protocol was used to indicate tests in advance although attending physicians referred to guidelines for managing avb . avb in patients with cad other than ami is usually irreversible therefore implantation of a pacemaker should be considered on a preferential basis .", "according to centers for disease control and prevention cdc more than 10 or more than 20 million people aged 20 years and older in the usa

imaginary that are necessary to maintain the static equilibrium of the anterior segment when occlusal force t acts on it . according to classic friction principles assuming frictionless contact the direction of a contact force between surfaces must be perpendicular to their common tangent . a uniform compression is the equivalent to an anteriorly directed c in figures 5a 5b and 5c . a uniform stress without a gradient is sufficient for t0 equilibrium figure 5a . according to basic friction theory the maximum max where is the coefficient of friction between bones . fortunately solving the problem is not a goal . a lever model of extraction would not account for the critical intrusive force component that prevents tension induced root fracture . abdc figure 8b forms a 4bar linkage in which b and d are constrained to move along arcs of circles that are centered at a and c respectively . although the demonstrated analytical method is inadequate for the solution of these problems it is the best instructional approach and it is conceptually far more realistic than the ubiquitous lever model . 2 internal forces and and moment are necessary for the equilibrium of all mandibles intact or fixed . 3 the stress distribution within an intact mandible should not be extrapolated to a plated or otherwise stabilized mandible .", " saccades are described as fast eye movements in which a target is tracked by registering the image of that target on the fovea . a generic neuron model is therefore desired to quantify the neural stimulations meticulously thus reflecting the physiology linked to the dendrite cell body axon and presynaptic terminal of each neuron . . in addition lfp response amplitude of the sbns was described as a function of saccade direction in 400 saccades by fitting gaussian curves to data see figure 8b in indicating that the sbn lfps can be fine tuned over all the directed saccades . a description of the synaptic properties of the major neural sites involved in execution of a saccade provides the basis for developing quantitative computational models of the neural network . as with the tn the utility of the modified fhn model under the tonic bursting mode exhibits this particular neural spiking activity . note that the agonist and antagonist tonic firing is governed by the ipsilateral in activity under the tonic firing operation mode . as motoneurons receive excitatory input from the ipsilateral ebn the burst discharge in them during a saccade is adequately similar to the ebn bursting . finally the number of ebn cells firing determines the number of motoneurons driving the eyes to their destination . the ebn when stimulated by the contralateral fn and perhaps the sc enables a special membrane property that causes a high frequency burst that decays slowly until being inhibited by the contralateral ibn . simultaneously the contralateral medial rectus muscle is stimulated by the contralateral on and with the inhibition of the contralateral lateral rectus muscle via the an a saccade occurs in the left eye . during the fixation periods the ins provide the steady state tensions required to keep the eyes at the desired destination . at the termination time the cerebellar vermis operating through the purkinje cells inhibits the contralateral fn and stimulates the ipsilateral fn . a typical neuron embodies four major components cell body dendrites axon and presynaptic terminals as shown in figure 4 . at the end of each axon there are presynaptic terminals from which the neurotransmitters diffuse across the synaptic cleft . a complete understanding of the properties of a membrane by means of standard biophysics biochemistry and electronic models of the neuron will lead to a better analysis of membrane potential response . each neuron s dendrite rise time constant determines the delay to emulate the postsynaptic potential propagation along the dendrite consistent with the initiation of firing with respect to the saccade onset provided in table 1 . computational efficiency accrues when the minimum number of compartments in the dendrite model is required . for instance the required coefficient for the ebn has been 35000 thereby it presents a peak firing rate at 1000 hz . as indicated the amplitude and width of synaptic current pulses for each neuron are uniquely chosen in order that the postsynaptic neurons exhibit the desired behavior . the first order time optimal controller model is defined by two complementary controllers agonist controller model and antagonist controller model . a linear homeomorphic mfm that captures the nonlinear properties of the muscle namely force velocity and length tension relationships is investigated . accordingly the effect of the number of active neurons in controlling the saccade magnitude can be investigated in an adaptive control paradigm of the oculomotor plant . is the angle of displacement of the eyeball from the primary position and x denotes the respective change in length of arc . each column of muscle fibers also includes two tendon elements whose viscous and elastic elements are b2 and kse at the top and bottom of it . analyses of the dendritic membrane potentials were performed with the ni multisim circuit design suite and the neural network was simulated in the matlab simulink environment . as described the number of active neurons impacts the control of saccades instead of the variations in the firing rate of those neurons under the time optimal control strategy . as demonstrated this system parameter is determined by reducing from a maximum of 100 active neurons until the eye position estimate from the mfm and the whole muscle model match . each active neuron exhibits the pause slide step firing trajectory as later shown in figure 11 substantiating the physiological accuracy of the agonist controller model . during the pulse phase however the ipsilateral tn is inhibited by the contralateral ibn while the ipsilateral in is inhibited by the ipsilateral ibn . as evident by different firing rate trajectories for the ebn this however the duration of the second portion of the burst discharge gradual drop varied among them based on the entire duration of the burst firing in table 3 . a time optimal neuronal control strategy for human saccadic eye movements was first proposed based on experimental data analysis . for the large saccades however the duration of agonist burst firing is directly related to the saccade magnitude . furthermore from the velocity profiles for the simulated saccades it was found that monkey saccade has larger peak velocity than that of the human . 100 identical muscle fibers were connected in series in both the agonist and antagonist muscles in the oculomotor plant .", "electronic cigarettes are battery operated devices that deliver nicotine to the lungs by evaporation of a liquid . after 6 months laboratory examination showed normalized leukocyte count and c reactive protein levels confirmed immediately by a second laboratory and by repeated tests after 1 and 2 months . cigarette smoking is a major cause of disease affecting several systems in the human body.12 although reducing cigarette consumption does not improve prognosis3 smoking cessation has important beneficial socioeconomic and health related implications.45 however quitting smoking is a very difficult task . although millions of people use them all over the world there is lack of clinical evidence on their efficacy in reversing smoking related disease and conditions . chronic idiopathic neutrophilia cin is a condition characterized by asymptomatic elevation of white blood cells wbcs and neutrophil count that persists for years without any underlying disease.9 smoking has been implicated as a cause of this condition910 and leukocyte count is a predictor of future cardiovascular events.1112 to the best of our knowledge we report for the first time a case study of a subject with cin that was reversed by smoking cessation with the daily use of electronic cigarettes . a male caucasian born in 1977 was presented in september 2005 with an elevated wbc count found during a routine check up . at this time he had been a smoker since 1996 9 pack years at the time of presentation . at presentation his wbc count was 14600l 8614l neutrophils 5256l lymphocytes 292l eosinophils and 438l basophils . 2 . a change in statin prescription from atorvastatin 20 mg day to rosuvastatin 20 mg day was done in may 2010 but no difference was observed in wbc count in subsequent measurements . although still inadequate research on electronic cigarettes has progressed over the past year . flouris et al19 found that no elevation in wbc count was found after electronic cigarette use in comparison wbc and neutrophil counts were significantly elevated immediately after tobacco cigarette smoking.19 farsalinos et al20 studied smokers and electronic cigarette users with echocardiography before and after smoking and electronic cigarette use respectively.20 acute diastolic dysfunction was observed in smokers immediately after smoking 1 cigarette while diastolic function was preserved after using the electronic cigarette for 7 minutes . despite all this data and the fact that no study has found that electronic cigarettes are more harmful when compared to tobacco cigarettes it must be emphasized that research is still in its infancy . in conclusion we presented a case of a young smoker having cin and low grade inflammation which was reversed after smoking cessation .", "for each patient written informed consent for endovascular therapy was obtained from a family member . endovascular therapy was performed under conscious sedation . all patients underwent non enhanced ct scans immediately and 24 hours after endovascular treatment and gradient echo mri 24 36 hours after treatment . intracerebral hemorrhages were assessed on posttreatment ct and gradient echo mr images and classified as hemorrhagic infarction hi or parenchymal hemorrhage ph based on the european cooperative acute stroke study ecass criteria . clinical outcome was assessed by a stroke neurologist using the modified rankin scale mrs during an outpatient visit 3 months after treatment . first the relationship between each clinical and procedural characteristic and 3month outcome was determined . the variables tested in the multivariate logistic regression models were those with p0.05 in the univariate analysis . all statistical analyses were performed with spss software version 21.0 ibm spss chicago il usa . a p value from december 2010 to november 2015 a total of 356 consecutive patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke due to ica or mca occlusions were treated with stent retriever thrombectomy at a comprehensive regional stroke center . in multivariate analysis younger age or 0.965 95 ci 0.944 0.986 p0.001 successful

predictors of good outcome at 3 months table 2 . in the present study successful recanalization defined as modified tici 2b occurred in 82 of patients and was the most powerful independent predictor of both good clinical outcome and mortality . in addition mishra et al . although the occurrence of parenchymal hemorrhage after endovascular therapy is multifactorial careful patient selection based on pretreatment imaging studies judicious management of blood pressure and reduced use of contrast agents and thrombolytic drugs during the endovascular procedure are all needed to decrease the occurrence of parenchymal hemorrhage . although this is a novel finding in studies regarding mechanical thrombectomy using stent retrievers a history of previous stroke tia has been found as a predictor of short term and long term mortality in patients with acute ischemic stroke compared with healthy control subjects in observational studies . however like advanced age severe stroke should not be used as exclusion criteria because patients with severe stroke do even worse with medical therapy alone . baseline aspects measured by ct or mri has been found to be an independent predictor of clinical outcome after stent retriever thrombectomy in two previous studies . however dwi aspects was not an independent predictor of both good outcome and mortality in multivariate analyses . in addition some potential confounding factors such as blood glucose level were not analyzed in our study . admission blood glucose level is known to be associated with poor outcome increased hemorrhage and mortality following iv thrombolysis or stent retriever thrombectomy .", "a 65year old man with intermittent colicky periumbilical pain which first occurred two months earlier was admitted to

index 2 and elevated mitotic activity . although diarrhea and dehydration may be observed at presentation of neuroblastoma tubular alterations are definitely unusual . also the polyglobulia could be explained by the same mechanism even if another factor could have been the increased production of erythropoietin probably stimulated by local renal parenchyma hypoxia .", "however it is also reported that mir369 3p can upregulate the expression of its target tumor necrosis factor tnf . a rapidly growing body of evidence shows that mirnas also have comprehensive functions in tumor progression . the importance of mirnas in cancer is highlighted by the fact that half of all mirna genes are located in cancer associated regions or fragile sites which are frequently altered or deleted in cancer . according to the hormonal activity pituitary adenomas can be defined as functioning causing endocrine dysfunction such as cushing s disease in acth secreting pituitary adenomas acromegaly in gh secreting pituitary adenomas galactorrhea and amenorrhea in prl secreting pituitary adenomas and hyperthyroidism in tsh secreting pituitary adenomas . however some pituitary adenomas grow rapidly and cause tumor mass effect the local compressive effect of large pituitary tumors on brain structures and cranial nerves . they can also invade downwards into the paranasal sinuses laterally into the cavernous sinuses and upwards into the parenchyma of the brain . aberrant expressions of mirnas have been demonstrated so far table 1 . hmga2 plays diverse roles in many biological processes such as embryogenesis differentiation and neoplastic transformation . decreased expression of let7a in pituitary adenomas was also reported in other studies 27 41 suggesting the general downregulation of let7 in pituitary adenomas . for the limit of sample numbers the authors only analyzed the association of deregulated mirnas and tumor diameter in the nfa group . in 2009 amaral et al . in addition to the decrease of let7a mir15a and mir16 they also found underexpression of mir21 mir141 mir143 mir145 and mir150 in acth secreting pituitary adenomas compared with normal pituitary tissues . among these mirnas mir143 expression was decreased in human lung and colorectal cancers 46 47 and was reported to inhibit kras translation in colorectal cancer cell . besides mir107 was found to be overexpressed in gh secreting and nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas and inhibited the expression of pituitary tumor suppressor gene aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein aip . expressions of smad3 smad6 smad9 meg and dlk1 were significantly decreased in nfa . through pathway analysis and in silico target prediction a specific subset of mirnas was identified that may potentially downregulate tgf signaling pathway in nfa . furthermore the integration and coordination of hormones and pituitary cells are important for the regulatory function of pituitary tissues . gonadotropin releasing hormone gnrh acts on pituitary gonadotropes to stimulate lh and fsh synthesis and secretion . gnrh induces expressions of mir132 and mir212 in lt2 pituitary gonadotrope cells to regulate cellular morphology and migration . during tumor progression the genes involved in cell cycle control often have aberrant expression resulting in unlimited tumor cell growth . ectopic expression of hmga2 resulted in the activation of cyclin a promoter and induction of endogenous cyclin a expression . furthermore an important potential target of mir503 is the cell cycle regulator cdc25 . apoptosis the process of programmed cell death is an important barrier for tumor cells . at the early stage of apoptosis cells receive death signals and then the apoptotic trigger is controlled by pro or antiapoptotic members of b cell lymphoma 2 bcl2 family and other regulatory proteins . accumulating evidence have shown that mirnas can regulate cancer cell apoptosis by targeting bcl2 family or other apoptosis regulators figure 1 . contrary to that another study reported that ectopic overexpression of mir184 resulted in increased apoptosis . study of cheng et al . mir200c which has been characterized as a tumor suppressor or oncogene in different cancers also inhibited apoptosis in pituitary adenoma cells by targeting the pten akt signaling pathway . tgf has been shown to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in hp75 cells a cell line derived from a clinically nfa . deregulation of bmi1 has been revealed to affect apoptosis thus mir128 which was downregulated in gh secreting pituitary tumors could also affect apoptosis by directly regulating bmi1 . although invasion and metastasis are rare in pituitary tumors studies provide some clues of mirnas function in pituitary tumor invasion and metastasis figure 1 . hmga2 may be involved in tumor cell invasion due to its association with epithelial mesenchymal transition that facilitates tumor cell invasion . in amaral et al . aggressive pituitary adenomas and carcinomas frequently have a deletion in regions near the rb gene 94 95 . fifteen pituitary adenomas patients were treated with lanreotide for four months before surgery while six patients did not receive any presurgical medical treatments . patients with 50 reduction of gh secretion after lanreotide treatment were considered somatostatin analogs ssa responders while patients with 50 gh secretion were considered ssa nonresponders . eight mirnas mir183 mir193a5p mir222 mir516b mir524 5p mir601 and mir629 99b were upregulated and five mirnas mir124 mir32 mir574 5p mir744 and mir96 were downregulated . putative targets of these mirnas are mainly igfbp family members igfals scp1 and matrix metalloproteinase9 . accumulating evidence demonstrates that a large number of mirnas have altered expression in pituitary adenomas and these mirnas may play important roles in tumor progression by targeting multiple genes .", "all of these sources are alternative

has not been elucidated microscopic examinations of veins and arteries involved have demonstrated vasculitis . it has been postulated that a genetic predisposition to certain agents might result in damage andor functional impairment of the vascular wall and endothelium of vessels . in our case hemorrhagic pericarditis was identified as a presenting abnormality with no other identifiable sign or

vasculitic process and that of aneurysmal rupture in cases of thrombotic complications6 16 .", "in the many hundreds of articles since published detailed molecular understanding of the crispr cas systems have been generated how the system learns to recognize new viruses which the components of the systems are and how they are produced how the virus is recognized and destroyed what countermeasures the viruses use and which non immunity processes crispr cas components participate in . a key question that has been surprisingly peripheral over the years is the actual function and importance of the system in nature . however crispr cas systems have evolved from mobile genetic elements and appear to have retained a capability to horizontally transferring themselves between cells though this have not yet been demonstrated experimentally . further a recent investigation of uncultured microorganisms headed by jillian banfield indicate that in some major bacterial lineages only 10 contain crispr cas systems . in the case of the acid mine drainage viral community early experiment on the role of crispr cas in virus host interaction in laboratory settings was published in 2013 using the bacterial dairy workhorse streptococcus thermophilus and its d2972 phage . another study on the same species demonstrated that in addition to the expected competition between crispr cas immunity and phage escape mutants there were some unanticipated results phages could establish themselves in a culture containing one but not 2 spacers targeting it bacteria without crispr cas immunity persist in cultures despite presence of a large amount of phage and bacteria with 2 spacers targeting a phage could still not establish themselves in a population of phage sensitive bacteria . a key question for understanding the dynamics of virus defense is the relative importance of different anti virus mechanisms . as a model system they used pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria and its dms3vir phage . the basic question as described in the article by van houte et al . came from the observation that while phage readily generates escape mutants the dms3vir phages still became extinct after some time in p. aeruginosa cultures . studies on disease and parasites in plants and animals demonstrate that genetic diversity improves the resistance of a population . to confirm that the interplay between diversity and immunity was not limited to the type i f crispr cas system of p. aeruginosa the role of diversity in type ii a system on infection of s. thermophilus by virus 2972 in was tested . indeed a dms3vir phage encoding an anti crispr protein affected high diversity crispr populations in the same manner as crispr monocultures demonstrating that the usefulness of crispr cas

subjects factor . 2007 it seems more likely that the previously observed effects of spatial separation on temporal sensitivity were induced by the availability of redundant spatial cues rather than fusion per se .", "a means for assessing the distribution of nucleosomes along stretches of regulatory dna would therefore be a useful addition to our understanding of gene regulation . aaaaaaaaaa tttttttttt other studies lend support to the unfavorability of these sequences for nucleosome formation because of their hindering of dna bending or flexibility 121317 . a nxs was defined as one of the dna sequences above a contiguous non overlapping dna sequence long enough to comprise one full turn of the dna double helix . accessibility scores can vary from 0.0 all sequences potentially occupied by nucleosomes to 1.0 no sequences likely to be occupied by nucleosomes . a direct comparison of the average number of nxss per window of 147 bases in hk and ts promoter regions is shown in figure 2 . this is the length of sequence estimated to be occupied by the basal transcription apparatus 2526 . acc50 was examined for the dna region from 110 to 60 the region in which the basal transcription apparatus would have to bind in order to initiate transcription at the majority of tsss clustered around the modal or central tss at 1 27 . another possible component is selection for gc rich sequences that bind certain ubiquitous transcription factors such as sp1 . a accessibility scores acc10 for promoter regions 1000 to 1000 relative to the tss .", "the term mucosa associated lymphoid tissue malt lymphoma was first coined by isaacson and wright1 in 1983 . a 54year old man visited daegu catholic university hospital after a screening colonoscopy that revealed a sigmoid colon polyp that was diagnosed pathologically as a tubular adenoma . 2 . according to the ann arbor staging system the resected lesion was replaced with normal mucosa on sigmoidoscopy 2 months after the emr fig . clinically it is usually asymptomatic or present with nonspecific symptoms such as bloody diarrhea andor abdominal pain . a malt lymphoma can be diagnosed during surgery or endoscopic biopsy .", "however its apparent toxicity to soft tissues conducted the researches for adhesives of longer chain such as butyl and octyl ca which present higher biocompatibility . after anesthesia with intramuscular xylazine hydrochloride 0.2 ml250 g xilazin syntec do brasil ltda cotia sp brazil and ketamine hydrochloride cetamin syntec do brasil ltda cotia sp brazil 0.1 ml250 g shaving and antisepsis were accomplished with 10 pvp i in the frontoparietal region . in group i the graft was only positioned at the recipient site without any type of fixation material . using the axiovision 4.5 software the images were converted into digital tif files standardizing the height width and number of pixels per inch . statistical analysis was accomplished with gmc 9 software statistical software created by prof . all animals tolerated well the experimental procedures in such a way that at 10 days after postoperatively the soft tissues handled during the surgical procedures were already healed with an aspect of normality and without signs of infection or wound dehiscence . at the interface between the graft and the recipient site it was possible to observe a thin layer of compact fibrous connective tissue and areas of bone remodeling both at the graft and the parietal bone . at the peripheral regions new bone formation with primary bone tissue asterisks from the graft fragment bone graft bg and parietal bone hematoxylin eosin original 160x superficially it was possible to observe a thin fibrous capsule covering the bone graft . adjacent to the fibrous capsule it was possible to notice the bone graft with its osteocyte lacunae containing basophilic nucleus . adjacent to the bone surface of the recipient site there were several resorption areas with a large number of osteoclastic type multinucleate cells . a large number of lymphocytes and neutrophils were observed into the medullar spaces of the bone tissue . in several specimens this new bone formation occurs only at the central third of the graft and their margins remained joined to the donor area by a compact connective tissue figure 3 . group i 30 days bone graft bg incorporated to the recipient

area of the bone graft fragment in groups i and ii at 10 and 30 days underneath the graft was observed with most of its osteocyte lacunae filled by osteocytes . proximal areas in some specimens a bone union with the recipient site was observed however in most of the animals this union could not be identified because the region was filled with a lymphocyte type inflammatory infiltrate some blood vessels and several collagen fibers that maintained continuity with the capsule collagen fibers . 1990 the screwed internal rigid fixation enhances the life time of the onlay bone graft decreasing its resorption when compared to the graft that is not fixed or stabilized by steel wire mainly in great mobility areas . according to clinical observations the technique for using the adhesive was very simple and mechanically the adhesive promoted a good adhesion of the graft to the recipient site . according to celik et al . 1991 the inflammation is caused by a reaction dependent on tissue oxygen explained by the transformation of the cellular membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids into hydroperoxide lipids which increases the metabolism of the local arachidonic acid unleashing the synthesis of tromboxane and prostaglandin . 2006 in a histomorphometric study utilizing rabbits as experimental models fixed autogenous graft fragments in the calvaria with ethyl ca adhesive . 2006 our findings showed that the physical presence of ethyl ca affected new bone formation . polymer degradation would be necessary for a complete repair process providing results similar to those provided by the conventional internal rigid fixation .", "aluminium al is ubiquitous in the environment and represents the third most common element in the earth s crust and it generally exists in a combined state with other elements . after systemic intravenous al exposure in rats and rabbits the extracellular al concentrations were seen to increase primarily in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of the brain

few papers dealing with this topic . for this reason we have evaluated data collected in a prospective multicentric study including 17 centers in spain and portugal with data from rds consecutively treated which was primarily designed to add more information on pvr development and clinical risk factors 1519 . as mentioned the project was designed to improve the sensitivity and specificity of a formula published by rodrguez de la ra et al . for that project a database record was created collecting 83 variables that included all pre intra and postoperative characteristics . all patients consecutively admitted for surgery between october 2004 and february 2008 with rd and a minimum follow up of three months were considered for inclusion . for this present analysis only patients with a macula on rd at the time of the surgery and the macula on during the entire follow up were included . during the period of time when these patients were included not all the centers had optical coherent tomography oct technology available and it was not considered as a routine component of the rd patient examination . a reduction of at least one line of best corrected va bcva in the snellen chart at the third month of follow up was considered as visual loss . in all cases 95 confidence intervals 95ci were calculated . comparing the preoperative characteristics of the overall study patients the g1 patients all of whom were in the macula on group were statistically different for the following table 2 . 1 absence of clinical signs of pvr at the preoperative examination was more frequent in g1 . 2 rd with an extension of 1 quadrant was more frequent in g1 . 3 percentage of previous cataract surgery in g1 is slightly higher . 4 eyes without myopia were less frequent in g1 . and differences for the other pre intra and postoperative clinical characteristics were not statistically significant . in some cases both procedures were used . because the central vision was not affected by the rd it is likely that both the patients and the general practitioners underestimated the severity of the disease and that may explain the delayed diagnosis . for our patients with macula on rds the evaluations were made only by indirect ophthalmoscopy or fundus biomicroscopy at 24 or 48 hours prior to the surgery . considering the timing for the management of this kind of rd oct become sometimes indispensable auxiliary test . as mentioned we did not perform oct on patients preoperatively to rule out a subclinical extension of subretinal fluid under the fovea a reason which could explain why some eyes with similar alterations have functional results significantly better than others . as no clinical differences were found between groups further investigations should elucidate if causes of visual loss are related to a gross anatomic factor or could be a photoreceptor damage caused by diffusible factors released by ischemic detached retina . first is that the study design was not intended to solve the question of vision loss in patients with macula on rd but in view of the lack of reports on va loss after macula on rd surgery we have considered that our data could be interesting .", "in fact ros may cause severe damages to several cellular macromolecules including proteins lipids and dna thus contributing to the development of many pathological conditions . cytotoxicity was quantitatively assessed by measurements of lactate dehydrogenase ldh activity released in the extracellular fluid from damaged or destroyed cells . for dna amplification of both

14 sds page then transferred to immobilon p membrane millipore . as sod2 is the primary antioxidant enzyme in mitochondria protecting cells from oxidative injuries we have evaluated the role exerted by this enzyme in sh sy5y cells in the course of diclofenac treatment . a similar picture emerged when sh sy5y cells were incubated with 150 m diclofenac and analysed at different times . a similar picture with proportionally lower signals emerged when dilutions of the cdna template were used in the rt pcr assay not shown . as shown in figure 7 the addition of sstrx partially reverted the programmed cell death provoked by the drug . a deeper insight on the involvement of mitochondria in the diclofenac induced apoptosis was realised with a western blotting analysis aimed at the evaluation of the cytochrome c release from mitochondria . also in our neuronal cell system diclofenac provokes an early and significant increase of the intracellular ros levels . for instance stautosporine a protein kinase inhibitor did not affect the mrna levels of sod1 and sod2 but decreased protein and activity levels of both enzymes . other authors reported that sod2 is degraded by caspases in jurkat t cells following oligomerization of the fas receptor . also in our system the diclofenac treatment induces an early mitochondrial hypopolarization correlated to an increase of the intracellular ros levels both events representing typical features of the onset of mitochondrial apoptosis . another crucial marker of the intrinsic apoptosis is the cytocrome c release from the mitochondria as a consequence of membrane depolarization .", " the bacterium escherichia coli is widely used as indicator of the bacteriological condition of food and environments due to its almost

of vanillylmandelic acid vma norepinephrine epinephrine metanephrine and normetanephrine . 1 . hand assisted laparoscopic right adrenalectomy was performed because of the firm attachment of the tumor to adjacent structures . her blood pressure was continuously normal and there were no fluctuations in vital signs during the operation . it was well encapsulated homogenous and had a yellowish cut surface with some internal hemorrhagic spots . an immunohistochemical study showed that the tumor was positive for neuroendocrine markers such as cd56 synaptophysin and chromogranin . among the many types of paraganglioma an exclusively dopamine producing type is extremely rare . because of the abnormal catecholamine synthesis pathway the levels of dopamine and its end product homovanillic acid hva are increased whereas the levels of norepinephrine epinephrine and their end product vma are decreased . blood pressure is sometimes elevated after the removal of this tumor presumably because of the same mechanism . because of the rarity of this tumor there are no definite criteria for evaluating its malignant potential .", "a ct angiography showed a dvt in the left mid femoral to popliteal

treated with pa alone 133 p 0.01 pa versus bsa . 100 nm exendin4 treatment with pa presence resulted in a significant decrease of apoptosis 87 p 0.01 pa ex versus pa . all these results strongly suggested that exendin4 protected min6 cells against lipotoxicity at least in part via activation of erk12 signaling pathway . although roles of exendin4 on cell proliferation and antiapoptosis have been demonstrated in cells its mechanisms are not fully understood . accumulating evidence supports the role of glp1 mimetics and enhancers in regulating proliferation and protecting from cellular apoptosis . erk12 a well known downstream target of raf1 has been shown to participate in pathways controlling cell survival . among bcl2 family proteins prosurvival bcl2 stabilizes the mitochondrial membrane and prevents the cytochrome c release from the mitochondria and the followed activation of caspases . after exendin4 treatment we observed that these alterations were partially counteracted

"activities in cells are partially specified by their respective ribonucleic acid rna content.1 with respect to mrna at any given time a theoretical human cell would feature the whole or some subset of all of the protein coding gene s transcripts including all splice variants . gene expression levels in this context means the steady state level of mrna since this is the quantity that is actually measured in the assay . 2 reasonable questions to ask are whether the various labeling steps alter the original distribution of the mrnas samples and if they do to what extent does this occur in order to address these questions an experiment could be designed utilizing a large quantity of rna from distinct contrasted biological systems . a corollary question was whether every instance of significant change in the steady state level of a particular mrna would suggest a correlation between the activity of the cognate gene and the physiological response . physiological measurements were performed following the 2week treatment phase . a significant variation of a series of blood analytes and of some physiological outcomes eg bmi was observed . a large quantity of rna was extracted from the liver of the mice from the 3 different treatments . this data processing was performed exactly in the same way for each of the 5 data sets with the same parameters . assay validation studies18 concluded that whenever slopes values were greater than 3 they would disqualify the data set for downstream analysis since an advanced degradation of the rna would cause the measurement to be unreliable . it shows that all of them were of high quality and therefore valid for subsequent analyses . the spread of the data across these 40000 dimensions was assessed by deriving the principal components . in addition for every laboratory measurement the biological conditions clustered within the same area in the scatter plot of the 2 major principal components . prior to the inception of the experiment the mice represented the same biological object each animal outputting physiological phenotype s values within the range of the biological noise . altogether these initial explorations allowed for the conclusion that the rna molecules quantified in this study were not degraded and were suitable for subsequent correlation studies . from these series of observations about the data there was no evidence yet that would have suggested that the source of biological variability was not conserved in any of these 5 data matrices . a reasonable approach to identify these elements was to perform a parametric test assuming a normal distribution of the mrna level populations . this assumption might not even been required in this case given the number of replicates large enough to rely on the central limit theorem . an independent samples t test was run to address the question of whether some mouse liver mrna have their respective level shifted to a different distribution whenever the mice were under high caloric food intake as opposed to low caloric . in other words 2 conditions out of the 3 of the original design were chosen for further exploration of the data set . following this test on 1 laboratory data set the exact same comparison under the exact same data analyses procedure table 1 shows the top 20 lower q value affymetrix probe set elements for the 3 of the 5 laboratory data sets . the whole data set which included the 5 laboratory measurements was analyzed as a single data set the 75 cel cell intensity files referred to as cel files were used as input for the robust multi array rma normalization operation and a single normalized data matrix featuring the 75 conditions was created . however there are ample gene expression studies reported in the literature where the variability in rna content is attributed exclusively to biological variability . table 2 shows the overlap between the 5 data sets . in this report we show that this is seldom the case . the alignment of the loading and scoring plot in the figure 6 allowed us to identify which variable ie which probe set measurement actually contributed to the spread of data points on the score plot due to the biological factor . in the score plot of the figure 6a the relative position of each dot corresponds to a sample . if the original distribution of rna had been the unique contributor of variability the samples would have clustered into two groups only . as more than 1 high throughput method has been devised since the early days of dna microarrays almost 20 years ago legitimate concerns were raised as to the relevance of comparing 1 data set acquired from 1 method eg affymetrix genechip with another method eg agilent microarray . artifacts are usually not filtered out by the research community rather they tend to accumulate in the knowledge based derived from transcriptomic studies . a matter of concern lies in the inference procedure used with gsea results in some instances authors would assign the gene ontology class returned by the gsea query to all the elements of the query list .", "cold therapy is an effective and safe method with few complications or

has high mutagenic potential by misincorporation of an adenine instead of cytosine causing g ct a transversion mutation . 8oxodg has also been implicated in an event called transcriptional mutagenesis tm whereby a misincorporated adenine in the transcribing mrna leads to the generation of mutated species of protein figure 1 . as shown in syn a53 t mutant species that was reported in the familial form of pd the pathologically misfolded proteins drive the template directed misfolding of the native monomeric proteins which contributes to the nucleation dependent fibrillation process . but the greatest paradox remains in the fact that production of reactive oxygen species ros as a by product of oxygen metabolism is highly toxic to cells . although all dna bases could be potentially oxidized guanine is the most susceptible base to oxidative damage . the defense machinery refers to the antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase glutathione peroxidase glutathione reductase and catalase among many others whose primary function is to scavenge ros generated in the cells . for example superoxide dismutase converts superoxide to hydrogen peroxide which is subsequently converted to water by either catalase or glutathione peroxidase . during this process glutathione is oxidized and it can be subsequently reduced by glutathione reductase . a number of reports have shown reduced activity of the antioxidant machinery in ad . as discussed previously accumulation of ros induced dna damage like oxidation of bases and single strand breaks have been implicated in the etiology of ad pd als and other neurological disorders . furthermore it has been shown that ogg1 knockout mice exhibit age associated loss of nigrostriatal pathways and increased sensitivity to the dopaminergic neuronal toxin 1methyl4phenyl1236tetrahydropyridine than their wild type littermates . although the exact causes for this selective vulnerability is yet to be elucidated da metabolism itself has been considered as a major culprit for selective degeneration . da has the capacity to auto oxidize at normal ph into toxic quinone species producing superoxide and hydrogen peroxide . failure to maintain both transcriptional and translational fidelity is expected to result in functional impairment of the cells . this phenomenon is referred as tm event in the cells . however as discussed briefly in the last section majority of cells under normal physiological conditions are not frequently engaged in division and do not undergo continuous cycles of replication . most of the multicellular organs of eukaryotes including brain or heart are mainly comprised of nondividing or terminally differentiated cells . in fact under in vitro conditions allowing tm event it has been shown that each round of transcription keeps producing a mutant transcript as long as 8oxodg lesion is not repaired . a number of studies have shown that a plethora of dna damage can lead to a tm event . moreover under condition of ogg1 null background in mouse embryonic fibroblast sufficient amount of the mutant protein was generated to activate the downstream mapk pathway leading to erk phosphorylation . it can exist as random coil state as well as sheet conformation upon aggregation or a helical conformation upon binding to membranes . more recently three additional mutations of syn h50q g51d and a53e have been identified in pd patients . in misfolded state the mutant syn proteins are transformed into amyloid fibrillar species consisting of sheets which have properties to serve as templates to drive soluble proteins to adopt similar structural changes leading to the formation of highly ordered aggregated structure . in vivo studies also corroborated the same idea that chronic and systemic exposure of rodents to rotenone 1methyl4phenyl1236tetrahydropyridine or paraquat leads to selective nigrostriatal dopaminergic lesions accompanying degeneration with syn aggregation . 8oxodg derived tm species may trigger this process leading to the pathogenesis of pd . however syn could become cytotoxic in the nucleation dependent oligomerization process in which small addition of mutant syn species to wild type population may initiate the seeding process and fibrillogenesis . all possible mutant syn proteins which could be generated through tm mediated replacement of cytosine with adenine in the mrna strand are listed in figure 3 . comprehensive investigation on age dependent changes in syn mrna profiles as well as identification of tm species supported by functional studies on mutant proteins will definitely add a new dimension to the understanding of syn pathology in conjunction with oxidative stress .", "a stroke is a cerebrovascular event in which the supply of blood delivered to the brain is significantly altered123 . although the majority of stroke patients are able to walk independently most do not reach a walking level that enables them to perform all of their daily activities . for example laufer et al . asymmetric walking caused by hemiparalysis can become a cause of instability during daily activities and these patients have a higher rate of falls than elderly individuals in the general population4 . trunk muscles are activated during the rhythmic movement that is part of the execution of gait . a recent study on balance and pilates demonstrated that pilates can be effective for enhancing both static and dynamic equilibrium capacity in university students in a 16week mat exercise course13 . currently most of the studies on pilates training programs have focused on orthopedic remedial exercise192021 or balance improvement in the elderly16 21 22 . bird et al . finally nineteen individuals with chronic hemiparetic stroke participated in the study age 64.7 6.9 years height 161.7 7.9 and weight 67.0 11.1 . the research protocol was approved by the institutional review board of sahmyook university . following participant selection they were randomized into two groups a pilates exercise training group pg and a control group cg . during the intervention period the pg was given pilates exercise training while the cg was not given any exercises or treatment at the center for the disabled . the pilates training program was based on mat classes lasting one hour per class three times a week for 8 weeks . one instructor demonstrated movements for patients to follow and the other instructor and the physical therapist assisted patients with the exercise . all movements included in the pilates training was based on 8 1 set of 8

several types of cancer asthma gallbladder disease osteoarthritis and chronic back pain 1 2 . obesity and its associated comorbidities exact a heavy toll on health care systems and expenditures . against a global background comprising of 500 million obese adults obesity has reached a historic high in canada with one quarter of adults and 9 of children meeting the definition . accurate obesity prevalence data are not only needed by public health planners and policy makers but also by those who conduct obesity research . details of the 2007 2008 cchs are published elsewhere 17 18 . the survey excludes persons living on aboriginal reserves and settlements or in institutions full time members of the canadian forces and residents of certain remote regions . the 2007 2008 cchs had three sampling frames to select the sample of households 49 of the sample of households came from an area frame 50 were from a list frame of telephone numbers and 1 came from a random digit dialing sampling frame . outliers with differences between their self reported and measured bmis that were more than three standard deviations from the mean were also excluded from the analyses . atlantic correction equations were developed in the mhw subsample . no other independent variables e.g. age were utilized as it was previously shown that gains in predictive value were minimal for the canadian population . for instance statistics canada mandates that cells computed from fewer than 10 respondents are suppressed and estimates computed from 10 or more respondents with a coefficient of variation cv between 16.6 and 33.3 are released with caution while cvs greater than 33.3 are suppressed 17 18 . all data analyses were conducted at the atlantic research data centre ardc at dalhousie university using sas 9.2 statistical software sas institute inc . cary nc usa . also atlantic respondents were significantly less educated and had lower household incomes than other canadians p .0001 . among the 2007 2008 cchs respondents residents of atlantic canada were more than twice as likely to live in a rural area . besides being slightly older mean age 44.6 years 95 ci 44.544.7 versus 43.2 years 95 ci 43.243.3 atlantic canadians also differed significantly from their canadian counterparts in terms of ethnicity and immigrant status . males bmi corrected 1.36 1.09bmi reported females bmi corrected 1.71 .98bmi reported . a negative difference between self reported and measured bmi indicates underreporting whereas a positive difference indicates overreporting . closer to the corresponding measured mean than the comparable means calculated from self reported data . although corrected estimates are not usually identical to direct measurements in recent years bmi correction equations have been more successful at bridging the gap between self reported numbers and measurements 7 915 . as reporting bias and error can vary from one population to the next and they may not be stable over time correction equations need to be developed specifically for a particular population and monitored periodically . given that correction equations are population specific we compared the national equations with the ones we developed specifically for this unique region of canada . both correction equations significantly improved the accuracy of self reported atlantic canadian obesity data . in sharp contrast jain found that under reporting of obesity prevalence in the united states was 0.7 lower in females than in males . the national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes played a role in the anomalous finding . corresponding results were found among american college students . our measured bmi results suggest that obesity may be at a record level in this region of the country . according to an analysis of canadian health measures survey data the measured mean bmi for canadian men was 27.5 kg m 95 ci 27.127.9 and it was 26.6 kg m 95 ci 25.927.4 for canadian women from 2007 to 2009 . however we used the best data and the largest subsample size available . in atlantic canada the provincial overall response rates for the mhw subsample were between 45 and 60 but this was similar to the response rate for the mhw subsample for the rest of the country . although a sampling weight created by statistics canada was used to adjust for differential participation rates if the characteristics of non respondents such as mean bmi were significantly different than respondents then non response bias may have tainted the study . an additional study limitation involved the measurement of height and weight . also although the bmi is frequently used to measure adiposity at the population level there are well documented limitations of the bmi as a tool to quantify body fat . for the particular correction method used in this study sensitivity values are reduced for the normal weight population . also the results of this study add to a small but accumulating body of research supporting the efficacy of bmi correction equations .", "the main structures related to human memory are the papez circuit the basolateral limbic circuit and the basal forebrain which

might have contributed to his amnesia there were no significant changes in the relative cerebral blood volume and cerebral blood flow compared with the corresponding contralateral regions fig . although bilateral retrosplenial lesions tend to have a poor prognosis retrosplenial amnesia generally recovers rapidly.48 each retrosplenium receives major inputs from the contralateral retrosplenium the orbital and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex the anterior cingulate cortex parahippocampal cortex superior temporal sulcus precuneus claustrum and the anterior and lateral thalamic nuclei.9

in a study analyzing 101 completely sectioned whole mounted radical prostatectomy samples the average number of different grades was 2.7 range 1 5 12 . a recent meta analysis revealed that the presence of tertiary grade correlated with pathological stage psa recurrence and clinical progression 14 . a considerable interobserver variation in the gleason scores of prostate cancer referred to several studies has been reported 19 20 . practically the large gleason score gap of 2 or more points in bgs and pgs rarely occurs .", "microbiological confirmation of bacterial infection is rarely achieved in children with acute lower respiratory tract infections alrtis because of the inability to obtain material from the infection site ie the lung . a prospective study in 2 large regional hospitals jeroen bosch hospital and mxima medical centre in the netherlands was conducted between october 2009 and october 2011 . exclusion criteria for participation were a recent severe asthma exacerbation oxygen saturation 92 anatomical airway abnormalities and the use of blockers or diuretics blood inflammation parameters ie leukocyte count and c reactive protein crp level blood culture and chest x ray were performed before initiation of the study procedure as part of routine diagnostics . sputum induction was performed with hypertonic saline nacl 5.8 inhalation using a nebulizing device with oxygen flow . specimens were considered of good quality if 25 squamous epithelial cells and 25 leukocytes were present per low power field 10x lens objective . a concomitant nasopharyngeal lavage sample was also obtained and used for routine bacterial culture . also infection with influenza a influenza b respiratory syncytial virus rsv and human metapneumovirus hmpv was routinely investigated by polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal specimens if considered necessary by the treating physician taking into account anticipated seasonal circulation . continuous data were first analyzed for normality using stem and leaf plots and quantile quantile plots after which either a t test or mann whitney u test for nonparametric data was performed . spss version 22.0 ibm corp armonk ny was used for all statistical analyses . in 6 sputum samples the bacterial pathogen was only detected in sputum and not in the concomitant nasopharyngeal aspirate moraxella catarrhalis n 3 haemophilus influenzae n 4 and sphingomonas paucimobilis n 1 . another study by lahti et al found evidence for a bacterial infection from induced sputum in 79 of cases but only included patients with radiologically confirmed pneumonia . because the use of radiology for the diagnosis of alrtis has been a major point of discussion study inclusion based on clinical suspicion of alrti probably gives a more realistic reflection of everyday practice . another limitation of our study is that we can not rule out the possibility that occasionally the induced sputum did not reflect the etiology of the alrti because we did not compare the induced sputum cultures with material retrieved directly from the lungs by bronchoalveolar lavage or thoracocentesis which would obviously have been unethical to perform in these non critically ill children . iyb contributed to the conception and design contributed to acquisition analysis and interpretation of data drafted the manuscript gave final approval

furthermore levels of blood pressure in the very elderly have paradoxical inverse relationship to morbidity and mortality . cognitive impairment was also common in subjects with heart failure combined with hypotension 14 15 . it includes all men born in the even months of 1914 in the city of malm sweden . a total of 809 men were invited to participate in the study and 703 men took part in the first health examination . all underwent medical examination including hachinski ischemic score . all the subjects had been monitored and treated during their lifetime according to these hypertension criteria and they were thus used for the statistical analysis in this study . ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed using micro am recorder model ki5600 kontron instruments . readings at 20minute intervals during a day from 06.20 am to 09.40 pm and at 60 min intervals at night from 10.00 pm to 06.00 am were performed . ankle blood pressure was estimated both at ages 68 and 81 years by placing a cuff at the ankle level and using doppler signal on tibial posterior artery or dorsal foot artery to detect peripheral blood flow in the supine position . arithmetic average of duplicate recordings was used . levels of clinic blood pressure p cholesterol triglycerides and b glucose as well as markers of vascular disease that is carotid stenosis ankle brachial index and its time change during follow up are also presented . at nighttime data of this cohort and uppsala cohort were similar concerning sbp dbp and pp . small samples of the danish study were presented by high standard

lesser amount of blood taken for the preparation and a procedure relatively faster while among the disadvantages we can mention the rapid clot formation which require speed in its surgical use . in 2001 choukroun et coll . have shown that platelet cytokines pdgf tgfbeta1 and igf1 are present in three dimensional fibrin matrix derived from these platelet concentrates moreover prf matrix traps glycosaminoglycans such as heparin and hyaluronic acid which have considerable affinity with some peptides present in the bloodstream and therefore show strong ability of chemotaxis and diapedesis useful for the healing of tissue damaged for example by trauma 9 . platelets concentrates are thus versatile products in surgery with regard to their biological properties and their easy manipulation in the form of gel or membranes these features allow the use of prf as well as other platelet concentrates in cases for example of maxillary surgical sites or in the surgery of maxillary sinus 15 . regeneration of the tissues exists naturally due to the presence of stem cells with the potential to self regenerate and differentiate into one of more specialized cell types . adult stem cells also termed postnatal stem cells or somatic stem cells are discovered in a particular area of each tissue named stem cell niche . different type of postnatal stem cells resides in numerous mesenchymal tissues and these cells are at the same time referred to as mesenchymal stem cells mscs2426 . in 1974 27 . in addition mscs also can also differentiate under appropriate conditions into cells of the endoderm and ectoderm lineages such as hepatocytes and neurons respectively 3435 . in addition de bari et al . furthermore not all adults need the extraction of the wisdom teeth . demonstrated that mscs derived from periapical cysts hpcy mscs have a mesenchymal stem cell immunophenotype and the ability to differentiate into osteogenic and adipogenic lineages 57 . furthermore hpcy mscs under appropriate neural stimulation acquire neural morphology and significantly over express several neural markers at both protein and transcriptional level in press not yet published research by marrelli et al . . moreover kim et al . compared the alveolar bone regeneration achieved from implantation of pdlscs and bmscs and identified no significant difference in regenerative potential in vivo between these mscs 62 . recently researchers are trying to identify the ideal scaffold that facilitate growth cell spreading adhesion integration and differentiation of mscs . different material have been designed and constructed for tissue engineering approaches using natural or synthetic polymers or inorganic materials which have been fabricated into porous scaffolds nanofibrous material hydrogels and microparticles . a great number of investigations for evaluating the in vivo application of mscs isolated from the oral cavity were carried out on animal models . a clinical study conducted by

affects many aspects of malignancy including proliferation and survival of malignant cells angiogenesis and therapeutic response . mary s hospital the catholic university of korea from january 2006 to december 2009 . however patients who had preoperative radiation therapy and those who were not able to undergo curative resection were included . routine laboratory measurements including white blood cell wbc count neutrophil count lymphocyte count monocyte count and platelet count were performed preoperatively daily until day four postoperatively and subsequently every two days . for a comparative analysis with the results of the other study grouping of the variables such as the wbc count neutrophil count lymphocyte count monocyte count and platelet count right side colon was defined as both the right colon and the transverse colon . the male to female ratio of patients was 1.481 and the mean age was 62.311.5 years . the follow up period ranged from 1 to 72 months mean

among the rectal cancer patients laparoscopic treatment was performed in 69 patients 11.5 and conventional treatment was performed in 531 patients 88.5 . five hundred thirty one patients 88.5 underwent r0 resection and 69 patients 11.5 underwent r1 resection . however neither postoperative wbc counts nor the number of days required for the leukocyte count to fall below 10000mm correlated with disease stage p0.394 and p0.402 respectively . a tnm stage greater than ii and nlr is significantly associated with the duration of overall survival p0.050 and p0.045 respectively but no correlation was observed between dsnlc and duration of overall survival table 2 . cancer free and overall survival curves are shown according to the stage time for leukocyte count to decline below

4.8 cm 13.5 cm . bilobed retrorectal cyst axial view of retro rectal tailgut cyst following discussion it was decided that surgical excision of this lesion was the most appropriate course of action given its symptomatology and uncertain malignant potential . a vertical incision was given over the swelling on the sacrococcygeal area facilitated en bloc removal of the sacrococcygeal cystic mass figures 3 and 4 . the ages ranged from 4 days to 73 years with an average age of presentation at 35 years . the contents varied from clear fluid to dense mucous . the differential diagnoses can be classified as congenital neurogenic osseous miscellaneous and inflammatory . excluding inflammatory processes congenital lesions account for approximately two thirds of retrorectal lesions . calcification does not tend to be a feature of tailgut cysts but has been reported and if present may suggest the possibility of malignancy . malignancy is suspected if there is focal irregular wall thickening and intermediate signal intensity before contrast on both t1 and t2weighted images with enhancement after contrast . historically the classical treatment in this area consists of different approaches the anterior transabdominal the posterior approaches inter sphincteric trans sphincteric parasacrococcygeal trans sacral trans sacrococcygeal trans anorectal and transvaginal . follow up of

mitochondria can be a self promoted structural scaffold in addition to its original role as energy sources needed for flagellar motion . many of which are suggested to be related to their tissue specific functions . in addition gigantic sperms in drosophilidae appear to have multiple evolutional origins it will be of interest to search for the crucial process that may have permitted the appearance of long sperm by asking which step of sperm elongation differs most between closely related species of long and short sperm . also large mitochondria are the most frequent feature of sperms

been described 9 sometimes large enough as to be described as our case illustrates that these residual deposits may not always be visible with toe probably because they may be confined to the vessels e.g. although the rate of stroke seems to be low 0.1 during tle our case highlights the potentially dramatic consequences of systemic embolization even in the absence of visible vegetations on the leads . although this may raise the concern of additional cost most patients undergoing tle have a preoperative echocardiographic examination either tte or toe in order to evaluate preoperative

hairpins may share some protein binding properties 20 21 . a common feature of these proteins is the presence of a polyq tract that is expanded as the result of the mutation . a systematic search for proteins associated with normal and expanded the data showed that the proteins that preferentially interacted with mutant htt are enriched for intrinsically disordered proteins and proteins involved in key cellular functions such as energy production protein trafficking rna modification and translation mitochondrial functions cellular stress and cell death . alternatively the expanded polyq stretch may stabilize one of several conformations characteristic of the wild type protein that may normally exist in equilibrium such an effect enhances some intermolecular interactions of the mutant protein at the cost of other interactions . dm1 is the prototype of treds caused by toxic rna 6 7 . direct evidence was provided for the crosstalk between the dm1 pathogenesis pathway and the cytoplasmic ribonuclease dicer step of microrna biogenesis in which the mbnl1 protein is also implicated . although the focus formation was accompanied by the aberrant alternative splicing of several endogenous mbnl1dependent transcripts this only occurred in cells expressing approximately 70 cag repeats and not a lower number of approximately 45 cags . as demonstrated by bonini and colleagues and richards and colleagues in two independent studies the co expression of exogenous expanded cag and cug repeats in fly cells resulted in a neurodegenerative phenotype . alternatively the repeats are placed within the 3utr sequence of a heterologous gene and are only transcribed . the genes hosting mutant repeats are usually a marker gene such as gfp or dsred . a serious difficulty in identifying the involvement of rna toxicity in polyq diseases is the overlap with the polyq toxicity in models expressing cag repeats from the orf and placing the repeat in the untranslated sequence of a heterologous gene is frequently used to overcome this difficulty and trace the effects of mutant rna . by mutating the start codon also in constructs expressing caa repeats or caa interrupted cag repeats the four model types depicted in fig . 2four types of models that can be used to separate rna toxicity and protein toxicity in the investigation of the pathogenesis of cag repeat diseases . at this stage there is a marked disproportion between the ability of a model organism to closely reproduce human disease and the frequency with which the model system has been used in the search for rna toxicity hallmarks .", "in the aftermath many questions will be raised . although an external us food and drug administration fda advisory panel was split on whether to approve the fda nevertheless felt that these conditions were met . because approval occurs while uncertainty persists a variety of post approval surveillance activities are performed in case the decision must be reversed . a lower rate would be preferable but without major changes to patent laws or to the science and costs of drug development the chilling effect of a more stringent approval process on dwindling drug pipelines would likely be considered intolerable . however somewhat unusually the withdrawal in this instance was a voluntary decision based not on safety but on failure to confirm efficacy . a previous simulation exercise of theoretical anti tumor necrosis factor anti tnf anti body trials in sepsis demonstrated that modest differences in the distribution of unmeasured variables such as host genotype and pathogen characteristics could lead to trials in which the same drug produces opposing results even when patients meet the same clinical criteria . given the potential for differences in important but unmeasured variables at baseline in sepsis to change the result such an approach seems wise . taking these factors together the company presumably decided that to go forward was just too

reliability of test results . cheung et al . although simple ss comparisons between different oct instruments is not appropriate because oct versions might vary in their approaches toward image processing and data analysis it remains possible that cirrus oct may provide higher quality imaging when image acquisition is performed under the same conditions using different instruments . moreover if the direction of disc attachment with respect to the orbit is unusual as may be observed with a tilted disc this can lead to a reduction in ss because reflectance is inconsistent . subjects in the high ss group evaluated by either oct mode were younger and had better va . all images were obtained by a single experienced examiner this may not reflect the real clinical situation .", "although it

ciat encourages intensive verbal practice with supported verbal cuing while excluding the use of previously habitual compensatory strategies . in this model it has been postulated that the behavior of attempting to speak without success leads to communication frustration . we also listed the study on www.clinicaltrials.gov registered nct00843427 pi szaflarski and several contacts were received directly from patients . after providing consent for screening the inclusion criteria were chronic aphasia related to a single ischemic stroke in the left middle cerebral artery lmca distribution i.e. the exclusion criteria were history of degenerative e.g. dementia or parkinson s disease or metabolic disorder e.g. encephalopathy or supervening illness e.g. brain tumor or other cancer history of severe depression or other mental illness and positive pregnancy test in women of childbearing age . five potential participants were excluded after interview . demographic and clinical data of the participants are provided in table 1 . after obtaining the informed consent we initially screened the patients for the presence of aphasia with token test tt and categorized the severity of aphasia as mild tt40 37 moderate tt36 17 or severe tt16 0 . retainers were those patients whose 12week score was not less than the 2week score on at least 2 of the 5 outcome measures . the 2week ciat protocol was a closely monitored individualized program embedded within a larger group activity . clinicians also viewed sample videos that exemplified the nature and set up of the ciat intervention and they were taught a hierarchy of cues that ranged from most to least supportive e.g. imitation to verbal reminder . during the first day of intervention clinicians had no information on participants abilities as by design they did not participate in the initial evaluations . the measures were administered by coordinators who were blinded to group assignment figure 1 . this technique of behaviorally monitoring another clinician rather than self monitoring was established in our previous study . clinicians and participants were rotated during each day s session in order to provide a balance in communication partners . at the end of day 1 alb studied the cuing tracking forms and the videos to create an individual treatment plan for the next day s session . the treatment plan included identifying individual baseline linguistic strengths suggested hierarchy of most beneficial cues behaviors to constrain and specific linguistic targets or goals . the treatment plan was reviewed with the clinicians before the second day of therapy . from the second day onwards clinicians promoted individualized support with cues at a linguistic level suitable for each person and continued data tracking . each day clinicians reviewed the individual program and levels and made adjustments as needed . at the beginning of each session day the clinicians reminded each participant of the goals and constraints that had been established for them . for example a participant who was strong in producing nouns but limited in verbs had a goal to add a verb to create a 2word phrase . if a participant demonstrated a milder aphasia then the d level hierarchy of sentences was implemented . the treatment program for each of the 34 participant groups lasted 2 weeks with direct therapy for about 4 hours per day for 10 consecutive weekdays . the sessions were organized into 4 45minute periods with a 1015 minute break in between each session . at the beginning of each session participants were dealt cards and they were instructed to play a go fish type game . the cards provided the opportunity for the participants to interact with each other during an ongoing game that engaged participants visual attention and memory skills although these were not specifically targeted . clinicians were encouraged to use redirecting phrases such as try again and are you sure rather than using negative responses . if the other participants responded positively and the communicative exchange was successful clinicians were instructed not to correct communicative success is more important than the sentence accuracy . consistent with the current standards of care the no intervention group did not receive any specific treatment and the participants were asked to continue all previous activities as usual . all participants were asked not to take part in any other intervention during their involvement in the study and all complied . patients were assigned to receive either 2 weeks of ciat or no intervention and then to undergo nat within one week and 3 months of ciat completion figure 2 consort diagram . randomization occurred after consent and with the statistician blinded to participant performance on screening and baseline testing . we did not replace subjects who do not complete the full 2 weeks of therapy . therapists set up the intervention groups so that the coordinators cb anm who collected all nat data throughout the study remained blinded to group assignment . participants were asked not to reveal their group assignment to coordinators during the post treatment interactions . all participants received nat which included 1 the boston naming test bnt 2 the controlled oral word association test 3 the semantic fluency test sft 4 the complex ideation subtest from the boston diagnostic aphasia examination bdae 5 the peabody picture vocabulary test iii ppvt iii and 6 the mini communicative activities log mini cal which is a subjective measure of communicative abilities . all data were entered into redcap research electronic data capture for subsequent analysis . independent t tests the mann whitney u test and fisher s exact test were used to compare patient characteristics between patients who demonstrated a response or change and patients who did not . all statistical analyses were conducted using spss 22.0 ibm corporation armonk ny and r 2.15.3 base package . the tracking provided constant reminders to only provide cues that resulted in successful communication . missing scores were left missing and are excluded from analysis . two patients in the intervention group did not complete the study 1 due to lack of transportation and 1 due to hospitalization with an illness unrelated to the study . overall there were no significant differences in demographic characteristics and past medical history between the 2 groups table 1 . the mean age was 57 sd11 years in the intervention group and 51 sd13 years in the control group . most patients were caucasian 1014 71 in the intervention group and 910 90 in the control group . responders were less likely to have a history of hypertension 05 0 compared to non responders 1014 53 p0.053 . first the study included patients with highly variable levels of post stroke aphasia making the comparisons between the groups somewhat difficult . defining a responder as a participant with 20 improvement on at least 2 of the 5 tests then the number needed to show significant between group differences would be 62 and allows for the design of a more comprehensive trial . finally a significant improvement was noted in the mini cal results for the ciat group compared to controls . social factors may be related to both clinicians and other participants in the group . only in the original study were participants randomized to treatment group however unlike the current study the personnel collecting linguistic data were not blinded to treatment assignment in any of these studies . all these studies showed that while participants receiving treatment improved linguistic performance between group differences were minimal if any . a future study enrolling a highly variable group of participants would require a sample size of only 62 per treatment group to show a significant advantage of ciat over passive observation . but the effects observed by us are in line with the results of the original study by pulvermuller et al . a transfer package similar to that offered in motor rehabilitation studies will need to be developed and applied to this group . also the outcome measures should include measures of pre and post intervention discourse and assess changes in the severity of aphasia using e.g.", "a case of locked patellar dislocation with vertical axis rotation was first described in literature by cooper in 1844 . a 14year old healthy male child presented to accident emergency department with complaints of inability to walk or bear weight on his left lower limb after he spontaneously dislocated his patella while running on uneven ground . upon further inquiry the patient gave a history of similar episode 10 months back following a fall . he was given a full length leg cast for 1 month after which he was able to resume his daily activities without any difficulty . 1 . an attempt to closed reduction was made under conscious sedation but was not successful . a decision for open reduction the patella was found to be locked with its articular surface facing laterally and the medial edge of patella locked past the lateral femoral condyle and wedged into the lateral gutter . a small incision was given along the lateral retinaculum the index finger inserted was through it and the wedged medial patellar edge was freed from the lateral femoral condyle and at the same time lifting the patella out of the lateral gutter it was relocated to its anatomical position . progressive active and passive range of motion exercises were started after 3 weeks and full range of motion was achieved by 7 weeks . hackl et al reported a locked dislocation with bony avulsion of medial structures after fall . only a handful of cases have been reported in literature in whom there was no history of direct trauma . hence we would recommend that in the settings of patella being vertically dislocated and locked open reduction would be the management of choice as these types of dislocations are difficult to relocate by closed reduction . open reduction avoids osteochondral damage associated with repeated attempts of closed reduction and allows the surgeon to perform patellar realignment procedures in order to prevent further patellar dislocations in a setting of prior patellar instability .", "as similar with the abnormalities in the

monodigitate pattern is observed on longitudinal distal sections . all of these are easily distinguishable by histopathology except fibrokeratoma fibroma and saf which need more careful differentiation . also a single case of om with myxocollagenous stroma superficial acral fibromyxoma like om has been reported . a three dimensional spatial reconstitution of om helps in better understanding of its variable morphological characteristics .", "by 1908 there were close on four thousand workers there . a wooden hospital protected by mosquito screens was built at the end of the railway . in response neiva started administering it every day at the same dose of 50cg . and even amongst those who were taking the full daily dose there were still cases of workers who would fall ill or have a relapse when they went to the capital . even so if treatment was interrupted for one or two days malaria would strike . and oswaldo cruz himself when studying medicine in the 1880s belonged to a group of germanists who would meet up to learn the language in order to keep up with the latest medical breakthroughs published in german journals . during prowazek and giemsa s sojourn at the instituto oswaldo cruz the institution was also visited by ernst rodenwaldt an army physician also connected to hamburg s institute for maritime and tropical diseases . it was interrupted during the first world war but was soon re established along with an exchange of merchandise and capital and an influx of german migrants to brazil . amongst the workers being repatriated from the amazon outbreaks of fever were exacerbated by symptoms of diarrhoea dysentery and repeated relapses . as they observed these anomalies nocht and werner progressively raised the dose of quinine they administered twofold and even more . in no patients they also found it notable that the nervous system was affected in two serious cases both with symptoms of beriberi . meanwhile werner thought it unlikely that the second form during the passage through the insect existed . according to nocht 1919 the trypanosomes resistance to drugs was stable and was maintained after many passages while quinine resistance disappeared in plasmodia after prolonged interruption of medication in the same host . apart from the hypothesis that there was a specific form of the disease in the balkans and turkey other theories were also put forward to account for the failure of treatment or prevention using quinine . free in the blood stream their life cycle was interrupted and they were destroyed . a defender of darwin s theories and critic of the inheritance of acquired characteristics an idea associated with lamarck but admitted by darwin himself weissmann a german biologist proposed the almost absolute constancy and autonomy of what was known as the germinative plasma an element responsible for carrying the hereditary factors in a way that was completely immune to the influence of the sum the rest of the body which merely transmitted the germinative plasma from one generation to the next . but rodenwaldt s formulations about quinine resistance were more strongly influenced by wilhelm johannsen and erwin baur whose insights contributed towards a reworking of gregor mendel s ideas from the early 1900s onwards especially concerning the emergence of species . he concluded that an organism s appearance was the result of the influence of mendelian traits and also a response to its environment . basically rosenthal accused rodenwaldt of mistaking a non specific form of immunity observed in people from a region with chronic malaria with the specific elements of the defence mechanisms activated by the organism in its interaction with the pathogen . . according to schilling the conditions that neiva nocht werner mhlens and others have presented as being propitious for the development of quinine resistant races are valid . as helen tilley reports about britain s african colonies while they the colonial scientists evoked the authority of laboratory knowledge they simultaneously challenged the physical boundaries and natural validity on which that authority was based. according to leo slater by different routes from those of neiva and other tropical medicine specialists researchers working on new drugs for malaria did their best to reconstitute the complex connections between parasite host and vector in the laboratory . according to neiva one of the factors that exacerbated malaria amongst these population groups was the incorrect use of quinine which was sold mainly in the form of a sulphate that was effective neither for prevention nor for treatment . as head of public health in so paulo from 1916 to 1920 neiva faced some serious malaria epidemics in inland and coastal areas of brazil s richest state . from the 1920s onwards neiva started working mainly in the organisation and administration of scientific institutions and from 1930 as a politician . a mexican military doctor also censured him for behaving not as a scientist but as a sly travelling marketeer. a publication from the following year shows that he saw resistance differently from neiva and rodenwaldt which suggests that the latters hypotheses had not left the theoretical realm my personal views on the matter have always been that the apparent resistance to medicine was less a characteristic of the parasite itself or even of certain strains of parasites than of the infected individual in whom it represented a lowering of the protective powers of the organism . according to heiner fangerau the combination of mendel and weissmann s ideas that formed the groundwork for rodenwaldt s analyses of resistance represented a watershed for the theories of racial hygiene it becoming clear how predictable was the inheritance of isolated features. angela creager suggests that the researchers involved in bacterial genetics in the 1940s and 50s rejected the conceptions of lamarck by which microbes adapted to drugs and transmitted this property to their progeny .", "epithelial ovarian cancer constitutes the majority of disease types and this review will focus on reports relating to advanced epithelial ovarian carcinoma . a medline database search january 1966 to april 2009 was undertaken using key words epithelial ovarian cancer debulking surgery and interval debulking surgery resulting in 80 articles with 14 relevant papers . the articles in full were obtained for each of the papers and reviewed by the authors . . again over 6000 women whereby the administration of platinum was deemed more important in influencing survival rather than the achievement of optimum debulking surgery . and the gog by rose et al . failed to show any advantage of ids . another major difference was that in the eortc trial primary surgery was not necessarily performed by a trained gynaecological oncologist resulting in different extents of debulking . this was also concluded by rafii et al . in another recent study the complete response rates after three cycles of platinum taxane chemotherapy was 36.1 . after ids 80 of all patients were left with optimal residuals 2 cms . a retrospective study between 1980 and 1997 from vergote et al . between 1989 and 1997 patients received either upfront surgery or chemotherapy depending on the extent of the disease and the performance status . a large norwegian retrospective study n 789 carried out at the radium hospital looked at treatment model for 1st relapse of ovarian cancer of any stage . complete secondary cytoreductive surgery was found possible in a significant percentage of patients properly selected for this secondary surgery . indeed there is evidence of a shift from debulking for all to debulking for a select group or put another way increased individualisation of therapy . the eortc study has been presented at the igcs in bangkok and generated a lot of debate as to the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy . another factor which can not be ignored in the debate is the inherent tumour biology where the question raised by some and still requiring an answer is to know if it is the surgeon s skills or tumour biology which determines survival outcome . in this respect opinions vary regarding its impact on the ability to surgically debulk . the progress and accessibility to novel technologies applied to biology will make possible in the future the assessment of new prognostic profilesbased on genetic andor proteomic tumour characteristics .", "a 24year old man presented with a limbal mass in his left eye which had initially been suspected to be a papilloma based on clinical findings . langerhans cell histiocytosis lch is a relatively rare disorder characterized by monoclonal proliferation of histiocytes . uncorrected visual acuity was 2020 in the right eye and 2080 in the involved left eye . intraocular pressure was within normal limits and fundus examination was unremarkable . after surgery the patient received topical betamethasone 0.1 and chloramphenicol 0.5 eye drops along with non preserved lubrication four times a day for four weeks . on gross histopathological examination light microscopy disclosed non keratinized stratified squamous epithelium overlying a diffuse inflammatory background composed of nests and clusters of large histiocytes with indented and grooved nuclei intermixed with lymphocytes plasma cells and eosinophils figures 1a and 1b . despite the presence of mono and multi nucleated histiocytes amongst the intrastromal inflammatory cell infiltrates on histopathological examination of the primary lesion lch was not diagnosed initially which might be due to the very rare presentation of this condition in the limbocorneal area .", "a 2year old asian indian female presented to us with mild fever and swelling of the right upper lid of 10 days duration . cutaneous anthrax was unlikely as there was no history

guaranteed .", "patients from a national cohort were operated in 2000 and follow up was until december 2007 a mean of 7.5 years later . blood tests with carcino embryonic antigen measurement and ultrasonography of the liver and chest x ray were carried out . the regional committee for medical and health research ethics of western norway and the data inspectorate for national registries approved the study . the chi square test was used to compare groups with respect to categorical variables and analysis of variance for continuous variables . multiple prognostic factors were analysed with the cox proportional hazards model using the spss 17 package . 1kaplan meier survival curve for 269 patients resected for colon cancer in three norwegian hospitals in 2000 kaplan meier survival

differences was found in os log rank p 0.423 and 0.270 respectively . 2 . stage ii patients had os of 72.7 with 12 nodes harvested and 58.3 with 12 nodes p 0.124 and stage iii patients had a 5year os of 61.5 and 55.6 respectively p 0.508 . adjusted for hospital t4 tumors compared to t1t3 was a significant adverse factor for survival in the log rank test p 0.049 . os for stage iv was significantly worse p 0.001 . an increase in sample size to detect a difference of 50 vs. 60 with a power of 0.80 in a one tailed chi square test tumor locations were not different between the hospitals p 0.059 . 1 and did not differ between the hospitals log rank p 0.372 fig . age as a variable was highly significant both as a continuous variable and with a cutoff value of 69 years . advanced tnm stage had an adverse influence on outcome as the results for stage iv versus i iii and stage iii versus i ii were significant in the multivariate analysis . a recently published international multicenter study of a colorectal population reported an identical os of 58.8 for patients treated in 20002002 . an advanced stage may theoretically be better treated with more radical surgery even though the presence of skip lesions in rare instances may hardly explain this . in a swedish population based retrospective study a median number of six lymph nodes were detected in the specimens from 1856 patients operated between 1996 and 2000 . doubtless a standardized surgical approach in cooperation with a dedicated pathology service is necessary if a minimum number of nodes shall be found and consequently help in outcome assessment . five year os varied from 83.5 in lnr group 1 63.3 in lnr 2 to 18.8 in lnr group 3 . 26 27 the prognostic effect of lnr did not depend on the total number of lymph nodes nor on the number of positive nodes . in contrast berger et al . fifty eight percent of our stage iii patients had less than 12 lymph nodes examined . we did not study the effect of blood transfusion and emergency operations were not separated from the rest partly because they were few i.e. 15 reported by sjo et al . even though the number of urgently operated patients was small in this series as expected this small group had a higher mortality of 12.5 compared to 4.5 in the elective patients . however it requires close follow up with ct instead of the conventional ultrasonography and chest x ray examinations .", "mtd was 13 mg twice daily on a 2week on1week off schedule for this trial . grade 3 hypertension and proteinuria occurred in nine patients 11 and six patients 7 respectively . a positive correlation between the dose of lenvatinib and hypertension and proteinuria was observed . as of november 2013 nonetheless an updated survival data analysis of the select trial at a later cut off date june 15 2014 was presented at the 2015 european cancer congress.50 to adjust for the crossover and estimate the true os treatment effect the effect that would have been observed in the absence of switching a rank preserving structural failure time model was used . after 34 months of follow up of the trial for the lenvatinib arm the median os was not reached for this group . an ekg should also be performed prior to initiation of therapy considering the risk of qtc prolongation associated with multikinase inhibitors in general.51 frequent blood pressure monitoring should be performed throughout treatment . according to the select study protocol dose interruptions of up to 28 days for patients with grade 2 hypertension should be performed prior to dose reduction 20 14 10 mg d . also as described earlier lenvatinib has been associated with significant toxicity and treatment related deaths . a recent retrospective analysis of 500 patients with ptc showed tumor recurrence rates of 25 among those with a braf v600e mutation as compared to 9.6 in mutation negative patients.59 following braf mutations in thyroid cancers 40 the most frequent driver mutations occur in the ras genes . formal quality of life assessments were not reported for the select trial but sorafenib treated patients in the decision trial had lower on treatment scores for the functional assessment of cancer therapy general euroqol5d and euroqol5d visual analog scales suggesting a detectable negative impact of sorafenib therapy on health related quality of life.71 nonetheless in light of the toxicity profile the corollary is that physicians need to be fully aware and aggressively treat eventual aes to maintain quality of life . a retrospective analysis of 17 patients with sorafenib refractory thyroid cancer treated with salvage therapy including sunitinib n4 pazopanib n3 cabozantinib n4 lenvatinib n3 and vemurafenib n3 revealed an orr of 41 and a median pfs of 11.4 months.72 this suggests that tkis with different targets may still be effective for refractory disease .", "pnf lower extremity patterns were conducted 30 minutes day 5 days week for 6 weeks . balance was measured with the berg balance scale bbs timed up and go test tugt functional reach test frt and one leg stand test olst . adl were measured with the functional independence measure fim which consists of 13 items related to mobility and 5 related to recognition . aquatic pnf promotes the maximum usage of muscle fibers due to the intense circumstances caused by buoyancy and turbulence moreover the water acts as a form of resistance stimulating proprioception and thus helping to improve postural control and balance8 13 14 . a limitation of this study was that it utilized a small number of participants and it was not confirmed that the positive effects persisted . future research should address these things when investigating the effect of aquatic pnf lower extremity patterns in stroke patients .", "discovery of vitamin k antagonists vkas in anticoagulation occurred in the 1920s when the veterinarian frank schofield studied the hemorrhagic disease affecting cattle consuming sweet clover . karl link and his team studied spoiled sweet clover and in 1939 extracted dicumarol and identified the hemorrhagic agent which was the substance in the sweet clover affecting coagulation . however this first drug for oat subsequently was found to have drawbacks by reason of its long half life . by reason of its different reagent composition the quick technique is sensitive to the coagulation factors fibrinogen ii v vii and x while the owren technique is affected by deficiencies in factors ii vii and x. the quick method measures factor v and fibrinogen which are not dependent on warfarin therapy and this constitutes a drawback for oat . it is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract within 90 min and its half life is 3642 h. in the circulation warfarin is bound to plasma proteins mainly albumin . figure 1the enzyme reactions involved in the metabolic function of vitamin k. vitamin k dependent carboxylase catalyzes the transformation of peptide factors ii vii ix and x bound glutamate residues glu to carboxyglutamate gla residues in the presence of vitamin k hydroquinone carbon dioxide and molecular oxygen i . the reduction of the latter to vitamin k quinone is catalyzed by vitamin k epoxide reductase which can use certain dithiols as the reductants ii . a comparison between the pt methods has been published in a recent article and the owren pt was superior . the hierarchy of reference thromboplastin preparations was presented by van den besselaar and associates . as the who calibration procedure was complex and demanding in the second stage the recommendation for isi calibration was local calibration using certified lyophilized plasmas . all these former calibration models involve the principle that the calibrator contains an average amount of inactive coagulation factors inhibition which means an average correction for patient inr results . in addition the number of inactive coagulation factors varies markedly in different calibrator kits manufactured or local . every new anticoagulant therapy patient should be tested for inhibition at the commencement of therapy . the therapeutic range lies between thrombosis and bleeding and complications are serious and general .", "some reasons why this occurs are as follows 1 . as long as the patient looks viable it is emotionally easier to accept the pie in the sky bye and bye long shot cure . 3 . it is not uncommon for physicians to ask loaded questions in their quest for end of life decisions . accordingly some families feel that if life support systems can maintain vital signs for a day or a week then suspended animation should be possible indefinitely until a cure is found . the fundamental maxim for these patients should be comfort .", "a 25year old korean woman was diagnosed with aosd four years ago after experiencing a high spiking fever maculopapular rash and polyarthritis in her hands elbows and knees . in july 1998 she was admitted to our hospital because of slowly increasing proteinuria over a 7 month period without pitting edema or hypertension . immunofluorescence study for igg igm iga c3 c1 c4 fibrinogen albumin and light chains showed segmental

with epilepsy with or without evidence of a seizure excluding documented status epilepticus seizure duration 30 min or seizures without recovery in between and asphyxia if postmortem examination does not reveal a cause of death the diagnosis is definite sudep and if there is a preexisting condition before or after autopsy which could have contributed to the death it is classified as sudep plus . there was a history of neonatal hypoglycemia during an apparently normal vaginal delivery . 1 fig . a 42year old right handed male with seizure disorder was admitted for presurgical assessment . since then he had been experiencing episodes of intense fear followed by generalized tonic clonic movements . 6 the very first eeg change started with 5hz spike slow waves over the left parasagittal area with the maximum amplitude on c3 and f3 . during 24 months of antiepileptic regimen the frequency of seizures was reduced remarkably . furthermore in cases of epileptic cardiac dysrhythmia isolated eeg or ecg recording may prove insufficient and prolonged simultaneous eeg ecg monitoring may be required . increasing knowledge about sudep risk factors can have a significant preventive role . moreover strategies such as taking a detailed cardiovascular history to get the comprehensive clinical picture including a detailed history of symptoms risk factors and prior cardiac findings should be undertaken .", "this condition which is estimated to affect more than 2 million persons in the u.s . alone has increased mortality and morbidity compared to the general population 2 3 . as an example there is evidence that fetal hypoxia has a differential effect on the hippocampus of schizophrenics and their first degree relatives suggesting that this temporal lobe region may be sensitive to prenatal environmental conditions 3739 . as another example significant interaction between suspected hypoxia regulated vascular expression genes and serious obstetric complications predominantly hypoxia although the causes for prenatal complications are quite heterogeneous their diversity does not exclude a final common pathway and there is increasing discussion that the common pathway involves both the immune and vascular systems in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia 43 44 . a benefit of direct measurement of the adverse prenatal environment through genetic analysis is that it can facilitate hypothesis testing regarding the role of prenatal obstetric complications in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia . an individual who is determined to be rhesus d positive has red blood cells rbcs with this antigen while someone classified as rhesus d negative lacks this antigen . a byproduct of the destruction of rbcs is bilirubin thus hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice can occur as well as kernicterus which is deposition of bilirubin in the brain . an infant is said to have rhesus hemolytic disease of the newborn when clinical complications arise due to the rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility . because maternal sensitization usually does not occur until delivery of the first rhd incompatible pregnancy it is not until second and later incompatible pregnancies that risk for a maternal immune attack becomes appreciable . another way to look at the magnitude of the rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility effect is to compute the population attributable fraction that is the number of cases which would not occur if the risk factor is eliminated . pd .76 in a study conducted in nairobi compared to pd .66 in the finnish population . thus the frequency of rhesus negative mothers having rhesus positive children will vary across populations . abo maternal fetal genotype incompatibility occurs when a pregnant woman has type o blood and her fetus has type a or b . a third hypothesis is that male fetuses but not female fetuses experience schizophrenia effects due to hypoxia or hyperbilirubinemia a specific effect . however one issue with the latter model is that it forced the risk to first born incompatible children to be identical to risk to later born incompatible children and essentially produced an average relative risk across birth order groups . such misclassification would serve to underestimate the difference between groups and bias results toward the null hypothesis of no birth order effect . first evidence supporting the relevance of hla matching to neurodevelopmental disorders comes from a study that found that parents of children with autism were significantly more likely to share at least one hla a b or c antigen in common compared with parents of unaffected children . for each locus mother and offspring were considered to match if the offspring s alleles were identical to the maternal alleles or if the offspring s alleles were a subset of the maternal alleles . there was no evidence for violation of hardy weinberg equilibrium in the founder alleles consistent with random mating with respect to these three loci . because the firstborn child of a couple is at highest risk for preeclampsia one could also seek further evidence in support of an hla b matching preeclampsia relationship by testing for a birth order effect . a second area of research would focus on if how the maternal fetal genotype incompatibility integrates with genetic liability for schizophrenia phenocopy gene environment covariation and gene environment interaction . following the recent work of clarke et al . a third area of research would focus on hypotheses that hypoxia is the prominent schizophrenia producing effect of rhd hla b maternal fetal genotype incompatibility . a fourth area of research would focus on hypotheses to further examine offspring sex dependent differences in the schizophrenia producing effects of rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility . for this area of research hypotheses regarding sex dependent differences in amount of exposure threshold effect gestational timing of exposure timing effect and type of exposure that is hypoxia and hyperbilirubinemia specific effect are likely best tested using animal models which can systematically vary conditions of hypoxia and hyperbilirubinemia .", "a

excellent reviews concerning ecm molecules and cams 713 . at present 25 mmps have been identified under four major categories collagenases gelatinases membrane type and stromelysins table 1 . along these lines the secretion of mmps by the growth cone appears to result in the laying down of a pathway through the ecm . it appears that timps bind mmps at a 1 1 ratio such that when in balance the expression of timps matches that of mmps . and others 45 65 have shown that following mechanical brain injury mmps and particularly timps are produced by microglia and astrocytes located in cortex and white matter and may play a role in neural regeneration or lack of depending upon the degree of expression and the time since injury . although our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the functional remodeling of synaptic pathways remains incomplete it is becoming clear that such reconfiguration involves alterations in the levels of mmps and timps . a tetanization electrode was placed

unanswered questions regarding the influence of drugs on ltp stimulated mmp release and activation and equally important the role of timps during ltp . comprehensive answers to these and related

bifunctional protein acting as a pgd2producing enzyme as well as an intercellular transporter of retinoids or other lipophilic molecules . deletion of l pgds leads to accelerated glucose intolerance and induces obesity nephropathy and aortic thickening 36 37 . fujitani et al . showed that the level of l pgds mrna expression is increased in uc patients in parallel with disease activity . in a diabetic rat model ogawa et al . because l pgds has a smaller molecular weight than serum albumin it may be expected to appear in the urine even before albuminuria and hence prove as a more sensitive marker for early detection of renal injury . similarly in vivo studies in mice showed that the expression of l pgd synthase was induced in response to lps and pa103 . pgs are a group of 20carbon

proliferator activated receptor and it promotes adipocyte differentiation 5 6 . in mouse models of asthma and allergic disease pgd2 has a substantial proinflammatory effect regulating many hallmark characteristics including eosinophilia airway hyperreactivity mucus production and th2 cytokine levels 40 47 . the injection of pgd 2 into the skin has been shown to result in erythema edema induration and leukocyte infiltration . similarly in a model of experimental colitis cox2derived pgd2 acting via the dp receptor was shown to attenuate neutrophilic infiltration into colonic mucosa . in a human model of an acute inflammatory response induced by administration of lps which evokes transient flu like symptoms with pyrexia and a hemodynamic response song et al . have shown that tetranor pgdm increases markedly during this response and that pgj2 has antipyretic effects . although several studies have investigated the role of pgd 2 in inflammation the role of pgd2 in host immune response has been scantly studied . an earlier study showed that pgd2 concentration but not the pge2 or il1 concentrations is elevated in a time dependent manner in the csf of patients with african sleeping sickness caused by trypanosoma brucei . although the production of pgd2 was increased in vitro the functional effects of pgd2 in this setting remain unclear . in a mouse model of p. aeruginosa lung infection we have shown that inhibition of cox2 improves survival in a lethal model of p. aeruginosa infection . mice that were given intratracheal pgd 2 showed an enhanced clearance of p. aeruginosa from the lungs . these results were in agreement with our studies from l pgds knockout and l pgds overexpressing mice . table 1 provides a summary of the models of different effects of pgds pgd2 .", "a large number of studies on ca have demonstrated that ca has a wide range of biological activities including inhibition of tumor cells . according to preliminary studies we

four women are missing data on prolapse symptoms on 24 women are missing in table 4 the various possible risk factors including the presence of pop symptoms for the presence of oab symptoms are presented in a univariate logistic regression model . an or 1 indicates that the factor is positively correlated with the outcome variable an or 1 means that the factor indicates a negative correlation . this is comparable with other studies where a prevalence of 16.849 was found in women 3 8 . however by the nature of these epidemiological studies a causal relationship can not be established . nevertheless several other mechanisms might be considered . as in other studies we found the prevalence of oab symptoms increased with advancing age 3 8 . the study of cheung found a similar or for overweight where the study of lawrence found a higher or 2.73 . on the other hand choo et al . found that bmi was only a predictor for oab dry urgency with or without frequency or nocturia but not for oab wet urgency with urge incontinence with or without frequency or nocturia . found no relation between current smoking and urinary symptoms while a large cross sectional study showed that current and former smoking was associated with urgency . one study found that current smokers were 1.44 time more likely to develop oab and the increased risk for former smokers was nearly significant . a possible explanation for this finding is that women after prolapse surgery achieved de novo urgency as was found in 5 of the patients in one study . the strong point about this study is that it is a large cross sectional study in a homogenic female population which made multivariate analysis possible as a result however genetic and racial factors could not be included which is also an inherent weakness of the design . another weakness of this study is that not all factors of influence on oab are included such as food and beverages coffee and alcoholic consumption and the use of oab therapies bladder training and pharmacotherapy . other risk factors are continence surgery in the past age above 75 overweight and smoking .", "cd and uc have been associated with

the origin of novelty that are consistent with the fundamental genetic principles of gradual populational change . a hopeful monster is an individual phenotypically discontinuous from the range of

subtle predictions might arise from variation in genomic structure and development . 1 . all three models are special cases of the general quantitative genetic model thus reconciling sudden and gradual origins of novelty without requiring a special class of mutations or population dynamics .", "caries activity usually causes tooth decay or cavities and can even lead to the loss of afflicted teeth which is particularly harmful to children s growth and development . in this cross sectional study oral health survey was conducted from january to july in 2012 . all children and their parents were informed about the nature of the experiment and they gave their written informed consent . a dental mirror and exploring probe generally dental caries was diagnosed only if there was a prominent color shape or caries like change in pit fissure or smooth surface . all examinations were performed by eight calibrated professional dentists who were trained for the assessment of the dmftdmft dmft index prior to the oral survey . height was measured using harpenden stadiometer holtain ltd dyved uk by having the subject standing straight without shoes corrected to the nearest 0.1 cm . bmi was calculated using the following formula weight in kgheight in meters squared . all data were collected on standardized forms and a database was created with all the collected information including age and gender . to protect confidentiality the database was password secured and accessible to only one data analyst . a total of 758 children from 28 primary schools in qingdao were initially included in this study . subjects fell in the age range of 88.5 years with a nearly symmetric gender distribution 51.6 males and 48.4 females . considering all the male and female children the mean height was 132.1 cm and the mean weight was 19.0 kg . classification of body weight status according to cdc guidelines values of dmftdmft dmft in each bmi group were compared and the results showed statistically significant differences between different bmi groups p 0.1 for dmft dmft p 0.01 for dmft table 3 with the highest dmftdmft dmft values in the underweight group . a caries severity was evaluated by dmft dmft values b dmft values . our findings might add some support to the notion that the restoration rate correlated with the regional economy culture and education . lastly our data showed that the mandibular second deciduous molars accounted for over 50 of all the decayed teeth which suggested the necessity to pay more attention to protecting the particular teeth from caries at an early stage . according to the studies conducted in chengdu and shanghai the prevalence of obesity was about 3 respectively which was similar to our data on female children but significantly lower than our data on male children 17.2 . criteria recommended by cdc guidelines international obesity task force or world health organization might have contributed to such differences causing the difficulty in comparing the results of the studies . as a result however findings of obesity caries relationship in children from different countries have actually been mixed and inconclusive . conclusions on positive links no links and inverse links are all present . this can be due to the confounding factors such as age gender dentition race ethnicity and socioeconomic status which might affect the final conclusion . also we utilized two indices dmft and dmft dmft to assess the caries severity in children both in deciduous and mixed dentition . this result was consistent with mojarad s werner s and roswitha s reports . in addition china s one child policy has turned many children into the little emperor of their families which argues against the fact that underweight status of the children is due to poverty . a severe state of caries disease was revealed in this survey of 744 children aged 8 years for whom urgent dental intervention and treatment were needed .", "2002 morelli et al . 2009

48 h of neuromuscular blocking agents nmbas along with sedatives should be prescribed for early sepsis induced ards and pao2fio2 150 mm hg . a serious question that must be answered is whether strict implementation of the 7 recommendations proposed in the sscg 2012 report will reduce the mortality rate in ards patients . and they confirmed that compared with non adherence to lung protective strategies the estimated absolute mortality risk reduction over two years in a patient with half adherence to such strategies was 4.0 while perfect adherence resulted in a 7.8 risk reduction . . in such cases the tidal volume should be further reduced to as low as 4 ml kg pbw according to the ardsnet protocol . alveolar recruitability may be assessed at bedside in the near future by computed tomography ct and electrical impedance tomography eit thereby making it possible to individually optimize ventilator settings for ards patients . compared with cv hfo was hypothesized to be a superior ventilatory strategy as it could avoid cyclic collapse and hyperinflation of the alveoli . demonstrated in a recent prospective study that using high mean airway pressure in subjects under hfo worsened right ventricular function compared with cv in ards patients . commented in their editorial it was not hfo itself but the hfo protocols and management strategies used in these clinical trials that were less effective than the established lung protective strategy using cv . demonstrated that lung damage develops at strain the ratio of delta volume functional residual capacity frc 2 . as the

exposure to tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking . fifty seven per cent of all newly diagnosed malignancies and 71 of all cancer deaths occur in those 65 years of age . in recent years management of cancer in elderly population has not been adequately addressed as these patients have often been under represented in clinical trials of new cancer treatments and most clinical cancer trials have had arbitrary upper age limits . advancing age may be associated with progressive loss of stress tolerance decline in functional reserve of multiple organ systems high prevalence of co morbid conditions limited socioeconomic support reduced cognition and higher prevalence of depression . all these factors can decrease treatment compliance and prolong overall treatment time which is known to be a detriment to therapeutic outcomes to cancer directed therapy . for all compliant patients overall treatment time was calculated from the day of initiation of cancer directed therapy to completion of treatment . in this retrospective analysis patient and treatment characteristics the salient features were that majority 4247 of the elderly hnscc presented in loco regionally advanced stage iii iv the most common site of malignancy was oropharynx 2147 followed by oral cavity 1147 larynx 947 and hypopharynx 647 . general condition was fair in most of the elderly patients 3847 only 547 of the elderly patients were in good general condition while the remaining 447 were in poor general condition . compliance to treatment decreased as the stage of disease increased 80 for early stage versus 62 in loco regionally advanced stage . a further analysis on pattern of non compliance revealed that early non compliance to therapy was seen in 5 118 of the patients whereas majority 1418 of elderly patients showed mid course non compliance . only 17 318 of the patients were non compliant to treatment during the course of radiation delivery . a recent analysis of critical impact of radiotherapy compliance in treatment of advanced head and neck cancers the trans tasman radiation oncology group trog 02.02 trial revealed that patients with major deficiencies in their treatment plans had a markedly inferior outcomei.e . amidst the pre existing geographical variation with inferior treatment compliance and survival in the asian population compliance of elderly hnscc patients is of utmost importance as advancing age may be construed i with progressive loss of stress tolerance ii decline in functional reserve of multiple organ systems iii high prevalence of co morbid conditions iv limited socioeconomic support v reduced cognition and vi higher prevalence of depression all of which may be the reasons for poor treatment compliance . as per available records the reasons for this early to mid course non compliance finding the probable explanation could be a long median radiation waiting of two months at our cancer center during which some elderly patients may have preferred early cancer directed therapy at some other cancer centers . further the possibility of upstaging and disease progression during the radiation waiting period can not be ignored majority of the patients were already in a loco regionally advanced stage . as per available records the reasons for this early to mid course non compliance finding could not be evaluated . elderly patients were not subjected to comprehensive geriatric assessment before treatment decisions . in recent years the improvements in treatment modalities and techniques have made the delivery of cancer directed therapy safe and feasible in elderly hnscc patients . a larger prospective study performing a comprehensive geriatric assessment and evaluating the role of comprehensive interventions combining cognitive behavioural and affective components to improve compliance in elderly patients is warranted .", "as a service to our authors and readers this journal provides supporting information supplied by the

these studies a set of video recordings of facial expressions mannerisms and personality traits questionnaires were common methodologies with high reliability and validity 17 . some other researchers have focused on driver s physiological changes such as the measurement of eye activity heart rate skin electrical potential and specially eeg activity as a means to detect cognitive states 21 22 . although several physiological indices available for assessing the alertness level eeg signal may be one of the safest and most predictive 2325 since it immediately reflects brain activity . alpha rhythm has the frequency range from 813 hz which occurs during wakefulness especially in the occipital cortex area of the brain . although some definite trends were observed in the delta theta and alpha power frequency bands during fatigue the results of different studies may be influenced by inter individual and intra individual variations in eeg data 30 . changes in eeg power spectra are associated with fluctuations in the alertness state 31 . all the subjects held valid driving license with at least 2 years driving experience and had no history of prior brain injuries . after taking informed written consent the subjects were requested to stay awake 18 h before the experiments and refrain from caffeinated drinks or any other stimulant as well as cigarette smoking for 12 h prior to

subjects were asked to drive the monotonous road at a constant speed of 90 km h . at the same time a continuous eeg and eog records were taken during the driving on the car simulator . the descriptive statistics such as central and scattered indices were computed in order to describe the variables . compared with the initial section the f vas scores increase significantly p 0.001 during the final section of driving task which demonstrates that continuous monotonous driving may predispose the subjects to cognitive fatigue . meanwhile spearman s correlation test showed a relatively strong and

quantity of vascular fibrous matrix e.g. elastic fibers and collagen fibers in media an organic factor and by changes in smooth muscle tone a functional factor . in particular the production of no is important because it is a potent endothelium dependent vasodilator and reduces vasoconstrictor response to adrenergic receptor stimulation 14 . in cad patients endothelial dysfunction develops secondary to reduced no production and early reactivation by reactive oxygen species 18 . because majority of patients in cad group and only a small number of persons in control group was taking one

discharged patients the readmission rates show a significant drop from 47 to 8.9 between 2004 and 2008 2009 . it is possible that some unobserved bias meant that patients more likely to return were seen in the 2004 audit . accurate diagnosis and classification of seizure type are essential to the provision of quality patient care and good control . during the intervention study the involvement of early specialist opinion allowed for the streamlining of those who required eeg which occurred on the day of admission in approximately 54 of the study group and in total over 90 had the test done in 3 days or less . 84 of the retrospective sample had a ct performed whilst only 28 had an mri . this has been ameliorated lately by the addition of a second scanner . retrospective chart reviews which formed the basis of initial baseline data are hazardous for deciding on service provision due to the unreliability and potential bias in the data . furthermore the initial analysis was on a relatively small number of charts . in this study the pathway was implemented by a specialist service and thus the generalizability of the results in unclear . however the lack of widespread use of pathways for seizure presentations requited that a proof of principle study was required . future study should now focus on the use of an integrated care pathway icp without resource necessarily to a

. a hierarchical approach was used with independent variables entered in their theoretical order of importance . statistical significance was set at p0.05 . in reflection of their younger age more of the ethnibus than other respondents were married or cohabiting 58230 49285 49138 respectively . fewer ethnibus than other respondents were home owners 532208 73429 85239 respectively and fewer lived alone 519 48286 49137 respectively all differences were statistically significant at least at p0.01 . for detailed characteristics of the samples see supplementary table 1 . consistent with the opqol findings 2394 of ethnibus respondents were in the worst two casp19 categories 29 compared with 843 of ons respondents 25100 of the ethnibus sample fell in the worst two whoqol old categories compared with 1580 of the ons respondents see supplementary tables 3 and 4 . further analyses by total qol scores and ethnicity in the ethnibus sample showed that 58 26 of chinese people scored a good qol with the opqol compared with 28 33 of pakistani 20 31 of indian and 23 31 of black caribbean people test 28.064 2 degrees of freedom differences by ethnicity were not analysed in the other samples due to their low numbers in ethnic minority groups . fourteen of the 24 whoqol old items failed this criterion in the ethnibus sample only . as expected all items correlated more highly with similar than dissimilar items in the scales . lower correlations were explained by reported life changes in the intervening month demonstrating the difficulties of test retest exercises in older populations . about 4 days ago the plaster was taken off my left hand so now i can go on buses again my only means of regular transport apart from volunteer drivers a few friends and taxis . anyway it means i am free my husband of nearly 60 years was told he has lung cancer so it has changed very much how i feel . we are trying to be as normal as possible but it s very hard my daughter and her young son have now left our home and acquired her own house . we miss them a lot my husband has just come home after spending another 2 weeks in hospital suspected heart attack. all correlations were significant at least at p0.01 with the exception of whoqol old in the ethnibus sample which was p0.05 . the casp19 control and autonomy subscales and the whoqol old autonomy subscale also correlated significantly as expected in similar directions with self rated independence control over life and freedom in the ons sample r 0.472 p0.01 r 0.466 p0.01 respectively but not in the ethnibus sample . for comparability the same independent variables were entered into each model . the amount of explained variance of opqol scores in the model was high at 77 adjusted r 0.774 . again optimal ratings of active ageing most self rated qol domains and also self rated health status were significant in both samples . causal model underpinning opqol adl activities of daily living ns not statistically significant at least the 0.05 level opqol older people s quality of life . multiple regression of baseline 19992000 predictors of opqol at follow up 20072008 qol follow up sample final model . in contrast the casp19 model for the ethnibus sample was weak the amount of explained variance in casp19 scores was just 14 adjusted r 0.141 although the model was still significant . the significant variables were self rated active ageing three of the seven qol domain ratings and the number of social activities and helpers health status and housing tenure . however the whoqol old model for the ethnibus sample was weak although significant the amount of explained variance in whoqol old scores was just 5 adjusted r 0.048 . the characteristics of respondents to the ons omnibus and ethnibus surveys and the qol survey at baseline were comparable with population estimates from the last census . also although the sampling approach of the ethnibus survey was statistically robust it used focused enumeration . ethnic minority groups in britain live in a wide range of different communities and their diversity may also have affected responses in some way . multiple regression models supported its validity and underlying constructs . it is of potential value in the outcome assessment of health and social interventions which can have a multidimensional impact on people s lives .", "among identified species

infiltrating the inner third of the myometrium the actual risk of node metastases is substantial for grade 3 histologic type tumors and for the middle third invasion the risk of node metastases is substantial for grade 2 and 3 lesions . do we need to do complete dissection for positive detection because negative staging does not necessarily identify a subset that does not need further therapy is another debate . all underwent staging surgery comprising total hysterectomy bilateral salpingo oophorectomy and pelvic lymph node sampling by the same 2 surgeons cgz ts using the same technique and instruments . body mass indexes were not significantly different between laparotomy and laparoscopy groups being 26.2 vs 24.4 respectively . eight units of red blood cell suspension were transfused to the laparotomy group patients and 6 units to the laparoscopy group patients . every surgeon was doubtful about the outcome of this type of surgery . because of such doubt many institutions established pilot studies and some prospective small scale trials . at any rate some were successful with speeded up publication encouraging surgeons to switch to this type of surgery . it has the advantages of less pain early resumption of normal activities and overall improved quality of life . in contrast to scribner s study gemignani et al found the overall charges in the laparoscopy group significantly lower than that of laparotomy group considering fewer postoperative complications seen with the laparoscopic approach a factor that lowers overall hospital charges . another randomized study comparing the laparoscopicvaginal approach with the conventional abdominal approach for treatment of patients with endometrial cancer was performed including 70 patients with endometrial cancer figo stage i iii . in a review by lecuru and taurelle laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy was declared able to retrieve 90 to 95 of the nodes which was similar to that of laparotomy . dragging cancerous tissue through a small incision and exfoliation from the surface and implantation into the healing wounds are the main reasons for an increased likelihood of metastases or recurrences at that sites . a laparoscope with 5to 7fold magnification could sometimes be superior in identifying such deep bleeding locations however difficulty in suturing or unavailability of vascular clamps may prevent the appropriate approach . however experience is of the utmost importance and there is no way to start scoping without proper training . duration of laparoscopic surgery

admixed populations represent a useful resource for mapping complex disease genes by using this long range ald which requires fewer markers to screen the genome than other populations or approaches . ald under the hi model decreases for both linked and unlinked loci whereas ald under the cgf model for both linked and unlinked loci increases initially and then decreases adapted from pfaff et al . 2001 there are several ways in which admixture can be an important resource in the elucidation of genetic factors that contribute to the risk of common disease . it has also been shown that markers

series of reports and recommendations that are available at a public website httpoba.od.nih.govbiosecuritybiosecurity.html . despite this experience and carefully crafted guidance there are points in the deliberations where uncertainties and even contradictory information necessitate subjective decisions . i heard from members of the influenza research community and reviewed the world health organization who data indicating that this avian virus had a very high mortality rate in humans . a pandemic by such a pathogen could reasonably be concluded to cause such devastation that it should be prevented at all costs . i know from firsthand experience that the free flow of information is part of the best and most productive research endeavors and that any restrictions burden the progress . the conclusion that this virus could be adapted to mammal to mammal respiratory transmission was in my mind the foremost beneficial part of the research . the details of the research on the other

prenatal visit table 1 . a total of 2253 children were diagnosed with pd during the follow up period and most of them were admitted as inpatients 96.3 . age specific measures of association were confounded by year of birth birth weight congenital malformations and underlying comorbidities . departure from additivity is a better measure of biologic interaction and a lack of statistical interaction when measured as an interaction term in a log linear multiplicative multivariate model can easily be mistaken for a lack of biologic interaction.22 several investigators have identified potential biologic mechanisms that may explain how asthma increases the risk of pd . although imperfect sensitivity and specificity of exposure classification is possible several studies that have recently evaluated the quality of icd10based asthma diagnoses in the danish national registry of patients have found the diagnosis codes to be accurate.1718 one study that used 3550 medical records as

cardiovascular risk increases with age in both sexes the increase in age associated risk appears to be sharper in women . consistent with this notion each year of increasing age at natural menopause has been found to be associated with a 2 increase in total cardiovascular mortality 22 23 . aging rats exhibit periods of persistent estrous cycle which consists of elevated and constant levels of estradiol low levels of progesterone and lack of luteinizing hormone lh surges in addition to ovulation 24 31 32 . an ovariectomy is the removal of the ovaries which induces a surgical menopause characterized by the cessation of estrogen and progesterone as well as reduced production of testosterone . alterations in cardiac structure and function are not the only alterations found after ovariectomy . additionally no significant change was noted with myocardium left ventricular or right ventricular free wall weight in the aging human female heart with no underlying cardiovascular pathology nor were age associated changes detected in proportion shapes size or number of mononucleated and binucleated cardiac myocytes . aging in the female f344 was also associated with increases in collagen content and collagen cross linking . additional work perhaps using other rat models is needed in order to truly distinguish if these alterations are due to increasing age or if they are simply specific to the f344 strain . age related changes in cardiac structure were also found such as increase in heart to body weight ratio cardiomyocyte cross sectional area posterior wall thickening and left ventricle chamber dilatation . . however according to the ich s7b the use of rats for the safety testing of drugs is not considered appropriate due to differences in the ionic mechanisms of repolarization . in addition an increasing number of mutations in mitochondrial dna mtdna has been gradually observed during aging . an important function of heat shock proteins is to protect against age related protein misfolding 103105 . in the cytoplasm the p50 and p65 are found as an inactive heterodimer due to the binding of the ib kinase inhibitory proteins ikk and ikk . although the effects of estrogen on mapk signaling have been studied in several pathological processes for example breast cancer migraines and polycystic ovarian syndrome little is known regarding how this molecule affects mapk signaling in the heart . aging female and male hearts have shown increased apoptosis and inflammation as well as age associated gender differences in nfb signaling . apoptosis is increased in many cardiovascular diseases such as dilated and ischemic cardiomyopathy hypertrophic heart disease and arrhythmias 126 128 129 . abnormal proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells vsmcs play important roles in the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic diseases . advanced age has been found to be associated with impaired endothelial no synthesis and endothelial dysfunction 153 154 . although estrogen 17 estradiol has been shown to activate enos estrogen studies in rats have shown no effect or increased enos expression following estrogen treatment . aging has also been shown to increase the activation phosphorylation of p4442 and jnk mapks in the aorta while another work has shown that aging affects the ability of the aged aorta to activate p38 and jnk mapk signaling following mechanical loading . aging associated increases in oxidative stress can lead to alterations in the cardiac cell signaling which may lead to deleterious changes in the heart .", "although many nephrotoxic fungal compounds such as fumonisins are known only ota and partly citrinin can be firmly associated with spontaneous cases of mn . citrinin penicillic acid pa hydroxyaspergillic acid and secalonic acid . a positive correlation has been observed between the frequency of spontaneous porcine nephropathy in bulgaria and the rate of ota in corresponding feed samples . however the analysis for ota of various feed samples from farms with high frequency of spontaneous mycotoxic porcine nephropathy mpn revealed that the values were substantially low and ranged from 38 to 552 mean 207.1 65.14 ng g for 1993 and from 42 to 427 mean 114.06 35.79 ng g for 1994 respectively . all farms supplied by these plants subsequently produced some pigs with nephropathy and growth depression but after changing the certain suspected feeds the problems with poor growth of pigs disappeared . a potent synergistic effect was found between ota and pa mycotoxins produced by the same ochratoxinogenic fungi when the same mycotoxins were given simultaneously to pigs and chickens 22 2630 . in addition the overall concentration of ota in feed samples from 0.38 to 0.552 ppm were substantially lower than the 1 to 2 ppm required to reproduce mpn man of severity similar to that observed in spontaneous cases 18 21 23 53 . a similar multimycotoxin etiology was also found for south african mpn as the same mixture of mycotoxins 678 392 g kg ota 833 positives 1492 641 g kg pa 417 positives 50462 1301 g kg fb1 80 positives was found in south african feed samples from pig farms with nephropathy problems unpublished personal data . the rate of toxin coupling with sh radicals increases with ph as well as in high temperature . as a result this toxin usually accumulates at relatively low temperatures during the winter at which detoxification is more reduced than toxin production . it is known that the p. aurantiogriseum group including p. polonicum strain is a potent producer of pa which can also provoke dna breaks in mammalian cell lines as has been reported . in such a way it could appear that the source of pa in bulgarian feeds can be different from the source of ota . also the same changes apoptosis and karyomegaly in tubular epithelium provoked by p. polonicum extract could be induced by another unknown mycotoxin this would be of interest because the same mycotoxin could be partly responsible for the nephrotoxic damages described in bulgarian nephropathy . also rahimtula et al . the same include the use of management practices to prevent the production of ota by the storage fungi the feeding of contaminated grain to animal species that are less susceptible to the toxic effects of ota such as ruminants modification of the diet to promote enhanced hydrolysis of ota in the gastrointestinal tract or reduced absorption the use of a feeding regimen that can counteract the metabolic effects of ota the use of various procedures that can destroy ota such as physical and chemical methods for decontamination of commodities as well as the use of various feed additives which can protect against the toxic effects of ota etc . . as a result the bioavailability of ota and probably the toxicity to ruminants is decreased . another way to prevent the production of ota is prevention of the growth of the storage fungi . large quantities of ota can be produced at intermediate and high ambient temperatures and high moisture contents by species belonging to the penicillium and aspergillus whereas at lower ambient temperature the toxin can be produced by penicillium spp . only . in addition the moulds in the corn when stored at 21 moisture produced a large quantity of ota about 3.6 ppm whereas none of this toxin was found in corn stored at 16 moisture . chelack and collaborators 72 73 have used another way to control the growth of ota producing fungi . at ph 4.5 as occurs in silage fungal growth and ota production was completely inhibited by 0.02 potassium sorbate 0.7 methyl paraben and 0.2 sodium propionate . feeding studies have shown no toxic effects related to the ammoniation process but there are some changes in the nutritional quality of the feed such as a decrease in lysine and sulfur containing amino acids . however other than ammoniation many of the techniques proposed to remove mycotoxins are currently perceived as impractical ineffective andor potentially unsafe for largescale use . also scott reported that ota is completely destroyed during malting of barley . according to laciakova and collaborators formic acid of 0.25 concentration degraded ota after 3 h exposure propionic and sorbic acids in 1 concentration after 24 h exposure and benzoic acid in 0.5 concentration after 24 h exposure . however the supplementation of ota contaminated diet with activated charcoal was considered as an impractical method of reducing ota toxicity in chicks or pigs that were continuously consuming ota . cholestyramine in contrast to the nonspecific absorbent discussed above seems to be an effective absorbent of ota in the gastrointestinal tract of nonruminant animals . another way to reduce ota toxicity supposed a good understanding of the mechanisms of ota toxicity inhibition of phenylalanine metabolizing enzymes having in mind a phenylalanine moiety of ota enhancing of lipid perooxidation and inhibition of mitochondrial atp production . via the feed or water usually contains various biologically active compounds cynarine flavonoids cynaropicrin dehydrocynaropicrin grosheimin as well as a high content of calcium and ascorbic acid . it has been recommended as a diuretic agent in cardiac and renal insufficiency and might accelerate the urinary route of excretion of ota 26 27 30 . cynarine and flavonoids as well as some medical preparations prepared from artichoke extract chophytol and chophytamine have a potent hepatoprotective effect against hepatotoxic damage 105107 . also antipermeability and vasoconstrictive effects of water extract of artichoke could decrease oedema in various internal organs provoked by ota 18 27 29 30 94 . the high content of calcium and vitamin c in the steam extract probably has also a protective effect against ota toxicity via improving membrane integrity of cell organelles and skeleton strength of the chicks or via some other ways 27 29 94 since some authors reported that ascorbic acid supplementation 300 mg kg of laying hen diet that contained ota 3.0 mg kg partially reduced ota toxicity . the allicin in that study was formed in advance and included in a natural oil extract in commercial lots stabilized with natural antioxidants . this is an advantage when compared with fresh or dried garlic cloves since thiosulphinate is hardly formed in the ph conditions of the stomach and intestine after eating fresh or dried garlic . a protective effect against ota induced decrease of total serum protein was found in chicks of all antidote treated groups mentioned above but a protection against the increase of serum glucose was only seen in groups treated with roxazyme g and artichoke extract . also a protective effect against ota indiced increase of serum creatinine and urea was seen in all antidote treated groups especially on day 70 . however it appeared that the protective effect of phenylalanine was slighter than expected one in contrast to some of the other studied antidotes . in the same studies another plant extract rosallsat was also seen to protect against ota toxicity expressed by statistically significant protection against the ota induced changes in serum levels of total protein uric acid and cholesterol table 4 . in addition the toxicological investigations in the same experiments revealed that the contamination levels of ota in kidneys are lower in chicks treated with artichoke or rosallsat in addition to ota than in chicks only treated with the same feed level of ota . by 1990 at least nine countries have regulations for ota levels or had proposed and enforced official limits for ota . on the other hand european union decided on an official limit for ota in cereals designed for direct consuming of about 5 g kg . a much better procedure for preventing the exposure of humans to the toxin from meat would be a toxicological analysis of a few blood samples of pigs chicken from farms suspected of having mn several weeks in pigs or several days in chicken before slaughter and a change in the feed source for a week pigs or for 23 days chicken if it is necessary . because of the short half life of ota in pigs 72 120 hours and especially in chickens 4 hours its concentration in blood and various tissues quickly decreases after changing the feed source or after prolonging the period of feed deprivation before slaughtering . balkan endemic nephropathy ben in humans is another renal disorder having a similar pathological characteristics as mpn . the high humidity and the poor food storage conditions in endemic villages the low living and hygienic standard as well as the consumption of home prepared food from own crops bread bean and others 123 127 correspond to the fact that the moulds producing mycotoxins contaminate mostly home produced grain feeds stored in bad conditions and high humidity while the situation in the towns is markedly different foodstuff supply is centralized and quality controlled that explain the family character of ben only in rural inhabitants . also the focality and zonality characteristic for ben are typical for mycotoxicosis i. e. endemic dissemination and are determined mainly by the ecological conditions of the regions which are optimal for the development of the corresponding fungi and by the altitude . nephrotoxic mycotoxin ota has been suggested as one of possible disease determinants of ben based on a comparison of morphological and functional kidney impairment between ota induced mpn and ben . however ota was detected in a concentration range of 5100 g l only in 0.4 to 2.5 of a total 13797 analysed blood samples from 14 endemic areas in slavonski brod croatia during 9year 19811989 period and in a concentration range 250 g l in 0.2 to 4.5 of a total 6910 analysed serum samples from endemic village of kaniza over the 10year 19851994 period . it was found that changes in debrisoquine 4hydroxylation in vivo can occur in the rat in response to mouldy food and patients suffering from ben andor upper urothelial tumors were more frequently extensive metabolizers of debrisoquine db . a recent study in egypt revealed a positive correlation between ota and the end stage renal disease esrd or urothelial tumors in humans . patients with esrd as well as patients with nephrotic syndrom or urothelial tumors have significantly higher mean concentrations of ota in blood between 0.52 and 2.19 ng ml and urine between 0.36 and 3.09 ng ml than patients from control groups between 0 and 0.08 ng ml in blood and between 0.01 and 0.26 ng ml in urine . as natural killer cells are involved in the distribution of tumor cells the ability of ota to modulate the activity of these cells might contribute to its capacity to induce renal and hepatic carcinomas . a slow excretion of ota suggests a tendency to an increase of toxin levels in the serum as well as assumes a very constant rate of ota in human blood for a long period of time even after repeated exposure to very low concentrations . it can be supposed that only the free ota in the macroorganism has a toxic effect on the tissues as well that continuous persistence of ota in human blood and its slow excretion via kidneys may be influenced on the slow progression of ben . a method is also presented for calculating the daily consumption of ota through various food products on the basis of the measured content in plasma even though the toxicokinetic constants are unknown . it is important to mention that this calculation should give an underestimate of the intake since the value used for plasma clearance only involves glomerulal filtration . this underestimate could be as much as ten times if the ota clearance in man is more similar to those in rat mouse and pig than that in monkey . because of the increase of scientific reports on ota contamination in beverages and many kinds of food the who fao joint expert committee on food additives jecfa assessed the available information and proposed 112 ng kg b.w . having in mind the strong carcinogenic effect of ota its ptwi was later decreased to 100 ng kg b.w . which corresponds to about 14 ng kg body weight per day .", "distal anterior cerebral artery aneurysms also known as pericallosal artery pa aneurysms are located on the anterior cerebral artery distal

all but two cases that required surgical evacuation . however we have recently favored these remodeling techniques to achieve higher postoperative occlusion rates . early rebleeding was defined as expanding hemorrhage with worsening of the patient s condition within 30 days after coiling and diagnostic confirmation was made by ct when it showed an increased amount of hemorrhage compared with immediate postprocedural ct . variables showing a univariate association with a dependent risk factor p0.10 were included in the multivariate logistic analysis . chicago il usa . besides drip infusion of heparin during the procedure further antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications were not administered in the other two cases . in these six patients with periprocedural rebleeding no new neurologic deficit developed in three patients 36 50.0 but deterioration of consciousness resulting in death occurred in two patients 26 33.3 . according to the follow up images obtained 9 of the 10 initially occluded aneurysms remained completely occluded and the remaining one showed partial recanalization due to coil compaction . repeat follow up angiography at 20 months showed in this patient that the condition was stable and the patient concerned declined additional therapy . however the patient concerned did not experience any neurological symptom . a review of the literature revealed pa aneurysms have a higher procedure related rupture rate than non pa aneurysms . based on these reports and the fact that previous reports included unruptured cases whereas we did not we believe that our intraprocedural rupture rate is not excessive . a more distal location leads to catheter positioning via a longer segment in a small caliber vessel which reduces the degree of catheter deflection when a coil encounters resistance15 . accordingly our findings caution that decisions regarding endovascular treatment in cases showing preprocedural contrast retention should approached by carefully considering the possibility of periprocedural rebleeding . furthermore an existing adjacent hematoma was found to have a severe negative influence on clinical outcome .", "as a result of increasing

applications in this area there are technical challenges that still remain .", "a patient s journey may begin with transfer from an ambulance to the emergency room and then sometimes continues to surgery and intensive care followed by a general ward . this depending on multiple reasons and common causes could be their present sedation or altered mental status . patients want to feel safe and secure both before and after the transfer and they can easily become dependent on the staff . ambivalent feelings about the upcoming transfers are also shown to be common both positive and negative emotions have been reported 911 . discharge guidelines and policies are seen as important in the management of transfers 14 15 and are also considered an effective management tool to reduce length of stay in the icu and improve the utilization of icu resources 16 17 . a study by goldfrad and rowan 2000 found that the overall icu mortality is 25 times higher if the patient is discharged at night . in their study the staff estimated that only 44 of these patients were fully ready for the transfer compared with over 80 of patients who were transferred during the day . based on the experiences described by those involved in the process it can be argued that it is important to learn more about how to enhance and organize icu transitional care . the process requires a beginning middle and end and how the person feels and perceives the situation is critical as the process continues . the study has been approved by the northern ethical committee in sweden d number 07 159 . the first author informed and asked the nurses about participation in the study in accordance with verbal and written criteria . they were informed about confidentiality and their rights to withdraw their participation without giving reason . as the aim of the study was to describe and illuminate the transition process between icu and general ward qualitative content analyses were considered 25 26 . data were collected between 2008 and 2010 in two hospitals located in sweden with different sizes . the participants were recruited in three icus and five general wards specializing in surgical medical or general fields . all interviews were conducted by the first author . the participants had different genders and lengths of experience 125 years 3 were males and 12 were women . their ages varied between 25 and 62 years . the interview text was read several times to get a sense of the whole . this was followed by an open coding with handwritten notes and headings in the text using as many headings as possible close to the text in order to describe all aspects of the content . it also included attempts to help the patient reach the best possible condition in the different phases so that their recovery and the rehabilitation proceeded as planned . optimize vital functions . the icu staff interacted with technology and other senses to assess and perform clinical judgments . this was expressed not only as one important strategy to prevent readmission but also as something that often could not be done . reduce and adjust . weaning and timing of extubation was one important part which was expressed as often time consuming and difficult for less experienced nurses . the staff stated that patients should have time to recover from the state of full respiratory support proceed to minor support noninvasive respiratory support and finally manage to breathe at least 24 hours without respiratory support . in the interview it was also apparent that technology should be reduced and only used when needed in the icu since the environment in the icu could cause trouble for the individual patient . instead the use of technology should follow the need for hemodynamic assessment so that the patients and their families became used to fewer observations and monitoring once the patients were transferred . adjustments to care were often done in an interaction between ens rns and physicians and needed to be documented in the patient record to maintain consistency . i think that patients that we try to wean that have been here a long time also should be used to not have full monitoring often there are enough with a pulse oximetry part of the day . it was also considered essential and helpful if the patients got early and frequent physiotherapy at the icu.we help the patient to drink water which includes helping them grip the glass and set it to the mouth we have to tell them that everything is better than doing nothing you can do it in your own way . it was expressed as essential to interact with the families and inform them several times about the progress care plans and goals . some patients and families needed to hear the information often and asked repeatedly about things related to their medical status and upcoming transfer while others asked nothing . i think we can do even better especially to work more with individualized information for the families . collaborating involved communicating and coordinating between the care units for transferred patients . in some cases it also involved care planning meetings with families and different physicians . collaboration could also include planning for what room the patient should be placed in at the ward considering individual needs and if possible what nurse should be responsible . collaborating and arranging a pretransfer meeting between ward staff and the patients and their families before transfer was expressed as one appreciated strategy . for example what surgery they ve done drains and also quickly check the latest values i try to keep up reading about the patient before the transfer so i do nt have to start from zero knowledge . but both our physician and icus physician insisted and we took the patient and went away immediately when we came out from the elevator the patient s vital signs were deteriorating . we hurried as soon we could into the ward to get help and had to alarm for assistance . that you try to focus on that this is an important positive sign that the patient has to be transferred at a ward emphasize that now is the worst of the crisis over when the day of the transfer comes it may not be too ridden with anxiety for the patient either but you have to play down the whole and try to make it easier it might be a grief to leave the place where you have been so long and become better . it was important to seek resolutions for problems and to see each other as equal . the staff expressed that barriers could occur for collaboration that instead complicate the transfer for example blaming each other and not trying to understand each other s work situation . hence interprofessional respect between the staff at the units was essential and facilitated the process . if they knew in time they could plan their work which made the process feel easier and safer . sometimes you can feel that something is breaking out something will be wrong with the patient i think it depends of a combination of your own intuition and the patient s history . there are always some warning clocks when you are checking vital signs and something is wrong . instill hope and courage . creating a good encounter with the patients and their families at the first meeting either in the icu or when arriving at the general ward a good encounter included a personal meeting introducing the responsible staff and interacting and supporting individual needs . they expressed that families often displayed anxiety and had questions about the differences in the environments . it was also important to inform the patient and other family members that staff members were available at the ward even though they were not physically present at the patient s room all the time . it took some time to establish hope and courage and some were more difficult than others.the patients and their families can be in a shock reaction when they arrive and they still try to process and understand what happened according to my experience this is more often seen if the intensive period were short . depending on diagnosis this ability differed but the ward nurses expressed that the care in the icu often made patients immobilized and used to others taking care of their hygiene . according to meleis therefore we assumed that the care must be individualized even if there are routines and procedures to follow . hence it can be argued as logical to strive for a strengthening process that considers these needs and involves an active plan for a smoother transition . timing seemed to be a critical point and this is confirmed in a study by garland and connors 2013 . 2003 showed that readmission was more often seen when the time between extubation and discharge from the icu was short . extubation failure were significantly associated with lengthened hospital stays increased frequency of tracheotomy and of pulmonary complications worsened functional outcomes and increased mortality . however icus can identify beds at the unit aimed at intermediary care where patient care can proceed but with less technology and staff . miscommunication can lead to risk of prolonged stay lack of continuity of care suboptimal patient flow readmissions and patient dissatisfaction reports 34 35 . the results showed that the handover process is multifacetted and can therefore be difficult to compare and evaluate but they also show that standard report pages are one way to facilitate reporting . boutilier 2007 concluded that the most important thing in the icu transitional care process was to systematically communicate the necessary information to the receiving device so that patient safety was not threatened and to ensure the necessary continuity of care . one characteristic of transition is disconnectedness associated with disruption of the links on which the person s feelings of security depend . furthermore patients have a desire for normality and independence and wish to be able to have personal contacts also seen in a study by mckinney and deeny 2002 . a study by schandl 2011 actually showed that multidisciplinary icu follow up and the first six months after discharge are most important for follow up . the findings of our study show that collaboration includes respectful functional communication between units and different actions aimed to intertwine the healthcare chain . the results of their study showed as did this study that respect and equality are important . a liaison nurse coordinates the transfer and is helpful for the patients and their families 43 44.the results of this study indicate that there are benefits to a function like that . this process is described as an active unique nonlinear process with stages and phases . however the nature of intensive care and its environment makes independence and autonomy difficult . mcfetridge 2011 discussed the importance of a structured patient centered rehabilitation program that patients can follow on their journey from critical care to ward and finally through discharge from hospital . mcfetridge also claims that interaction in care is essential so as to prevent actions taken from becoming fragmented . hence the process should be seamless and transparent for all persons that are involved in the patient s care journey and include a multidiscipline approach and a family perspective . 2013 implies that there are social and cultural barriers to the implementation of guidelines and effective icu discharge . to summarize no guidelines in clinical practice are useful if there is low adherence . also important are resources time staffing and knowledge essential components in order to manage the organization of a safe transfer process from the icu to a general ward . a recent study showed that nursing care hours per patient in the icu and skill that mix significantly contribute to prevention of bloodstream infections and a shorter length of stay in the icu . 2011 found that caring for an increasing number of patients with complex problems caused stress for nursing staff already facing work overload in wards . both authors were familiar with chosen method . during the analysis they were both part of the process and discussed how to label the codes subcategories and categories until agreement . by presenting the process of the analysis and presenting the result with quotes from the text so it is possible for the readers to create their own value important for the study s credibility . a recent review described patients and families experiences about transfers from icu the themes were physical responses psychological responses information and communication safety and security and the needs of relatives all of which have been addressed in the sec model developed through this study . the significance of this study is also strengthened by a study by lin et al . 2009 who claim that clarification of guidelines and standardization of discharge decision making and handover are needed . according to massey et al . 2008 suboptimal care at the wards depends on failure to seek advice failure to appreciate clinical urgency lack of knowledge failure of the organization and lack of supervision . a recommendation for future studies is to explore safe transitions out of the family perspective in a systemic way .", " microglia are macrophage like resident immune cells in the central nervous system cns and possess both neurotoxic and neuroprotective function . another

interviews . besides displays of overt economic status a player would be expected to show he could afford and handle several women at the same time . a woman who crossed the strict boundaries that existed for gender relations was often labelled a bitch a term also sometimes used to describe women in general.they get a negative label they are called bitches . applying restrictive social norms to certain female behaviours was not the only way to define men s masculinity and to promote power imbalances . although findings might only be representative of this group of men we believe that this unique opportunity to reach men in this harsh urban setting provides important new knowledge on how contemporary masculine ideals affect gender dynamics that need to be addressed in hiv prevention .", "hence there is currently much debate regarding the actual benefits of such a strategy in intensive care patients in terms of outcomes . as with the other reported studies comparing protocols efficacy

takahashi and yamanaka developed a method for reprogramming human somatic cells so that they entered a pluripotent state allowing for further differentiation into other cell types including neurons . as generation and characterization of ipsc lines can be laborious and costly one obvious solution to assure the validity of ipsc disease models is to create research teams that work together on a particular disorder sharing ipsc lines and derived neurons . these included gene expression cell adhesion bioenergetics glutamate toxicity cell death calcium flux and trophic factor withdrawal . the common results that were recapitulated across the various laboratories highlight the integrity of the developed ipsc lines making the hd ipsc consortium study an impressive blueprint that is worthy of emulation . in tandem these papers catalogue a variety of phenotypes that were observed in hd ipsc derived neural progenitors and in medium spiny neurons . notably the expression differences between the hd ipscs and corrected hd ipscs were of an order of magnitude less than those between non related control ipscs and hd ipscs . an et al . also generated corrected hd ipscs by homologous recombination and showed that when compared to corrected hd ipscs hd ipscs have increased expression of genes that are induced by the tgf signaling pathway and decreased expression of cadherin pathway

patients are subdivided according to their main symptom that have been proposed in the so called rome criteria ibs with diarrhea ibs d ibs with constipation ibs c or ibs with mixed bowel habits ibs m . recently a number of bistable microbial groups i.e. as the development of ibs is multifactorial we hypothesized that the observed symptoms and development of pi ibs may arise from the interplay between the faecal microbiota the host immune response and psychological factors . by using a novel bioinformatic approach bootstrap aggregated rda method baggedrda we identified a combination of 27 genus like bacterial groups that significantly separated healthy controls and patients with ibs symptoms . this rank ordering reflected the patient s health status as it correlated with the increase of several immunological markers and intestinal complaints where as no such associations were observed when subdividing the patients according to their clinical status . although the intestinal microbiota of these patients was not studied in the light of the recent evidence it could be hypothesized that the etiology of the disease in the patients with psychological symptoms differs from those with microbial aberrations . 1 . the strongest difference was observed with the significant increase in the bacteroides ssp . and decrease of members of the uncultured clostridiales in the pi ibs patients . one of them was dialister which was recently identified as bistable i.e. being either abundant or nearly absent in contrast to most other bacteria that show gradual abundance distribution . abundance of the discriminating taxa creates the so called index of microbial dysbiosis imd . recently similar observations were made in humans by dicksved and colleagues who followed abattoir workers who have a high risk of contracting c. jejuni infection . the participants donated faecal samples at the start of employment and were then regularly followed . and decreased levels of firmicutes immediately after the infection . although the infectious agents in this study were diverse the differences in the microbiota profile were similar to what we found . hence the observed imd may be a reflection of the activity of the host s immune system . we mapped the microarray derived gene expression data from rectal biopsies to known biological functions using gene set analysis gsa . for example the majority of the dietary threonine is utilized for synthesising the secretory mucin and its dietary restriction results into impaired gut barrier . moreover the mucus structure and the extent of its glycosylation shape the microbiota composition and similar compositional changes have also been previously associated with barrier function abnormalities . fucosyltransferase2 is involved in the formation of the abo blood groups and its activity also creates adhesion receptor for several microbes . therefore it is interesting that fut2 deficient mice fut2 have been shown to display similar differences in their microbiota composition to what was found in our study i.e. in addition to alterations in the mucosal barrier genes we identified several other pathways including those that regulate cell junctions and inflammatory responses to be associated with the imd bacterial taxa . changes in the inflammatory response barrier function and microbiota composition could therefore lead into changes in the other host parameters such as gut brain axis receiving signals from these systems . the correlations between host response and microbiota aberration identified in our study are indicated in bold . this is of significance as it allows not only to diagnose these subjects but also may provide basis for treatment . dietary corrections represent the major approach in managing the ibs symptoms and it is expected that their efficacy depends on the individual s gut microbiota as microbial activity on food metabolism directly or indirectly contributes to many ibs symptoms . of note those children whose symptoms decreased during the test diet had lower abundance of bacteroides and dialister spp . we believe that the proposed model fig . 2 built on microbiota based patient stratification will not only give insight into the observed microbiota heterogeneity among ibs patients as well as its partial overlap with healthy controls but also represents a concrete step toward improved diagnostics and novel treatment options with improved efficacy . we are grateful to our collaborators notably prof robin spiller md and prof robert jan brummer md for helpful discussions . this work was partly supported by the finland academy of sciences grants 137389 141140 and 1272870 and the unrestricted spinoza of the netherlands organization for scientific

surface . amd has been successfully applied to a number of biological systems 10 and hundreds of nanosecond amd simulations have been shown to capture millisecond time scale events in both globular and membrane proteins . several kilocalories per mole . a minimal set of simulation parameters is dynamically adjusted to control the magnitude and distribution width of the boost potential . v1 v2 . as illustrated in figure 1 k0 determines the magnitude of the applied boost potential . 10kbt for accurate reweighting . for efficient enhanced sampling with the highest possible acceleration k0 can then be set to its upper bound as9the greater v that is obtained from the original potential energy surface particularly for large biomolecules the smaller k0 may be applicable to allow for accurate reweighting . alternatively when the threshold energy e is set to its upper bound e vmin 1k according to eq 5 we plug in e and k in eq 7 and obtain10we define the right hand side in eq 10 as k0 1 0v vmax vminvav vmin . e vmax for default k0 1 . as increases the v distribution becomes less harmonic and the reweighted free energy profile obtained from cumulant expansion to the second order deviates from the original . as demonstrated on the alanine dipeptide chignolin and t4lysozyme in this study a gaussian distribution of the boost potential is normally achieved in the gamd simulations . the anharmonicity of v distribution serves as an indicator of the enhanced sampling convergence and accuracy of the reweighted free energy . another four benzene molecules were placed in the bulk solvent at least 40 away from the ligand binding site in the starting configuration . bonds containing hydrogen atoms were restrained with the shake algorithm and a 2 fs time step was used . weak coupling to an external temperature and pressure bath was used to control both temperature and pressure . the electrostatic interactions were calculated using the pme particle mesh ewald summation with a cutoff

cutoff can be determined by iteratively increasing it until the minimum position of the pmf profile does not change . gamd provides enhanced sampling of conformational transitions in alanine dipeptide

short gamd simulations 2 ns were tested on alanine dipeptide to search for optimal acceleration parameters . after k0p reached its maximum 1.0 slight changes were observed when 0p was further increased from 2.0 to 3.0 . as shown in figure 2b the boost potential v applied in gamd simulation of the alanine dipeptide follows gaussian distribution . additionally the distribution anharmonicity of vof frames clustered in each bin of the 2d pmf exhibits values smaller than 0.10 in the low energy regions figure 2d which suggests sufficient sampling for reweighting using cumulant expansion to the second order . greater anharmonicity is found in high energy regions especially the energy barriers for which low boost potential is applied and less sampling is normally achieved . a scheme

the ionic liquids have been studied since the 1950s but they can not to be handled under an inert atmosphere . because of its extremely low volatility some of the rtils are promising environment friendly solvents instead of the volatile organic solvents in a range of science and technology applications such as media for organic and inorganic reactions materials processing electrochemistry and chemical separation . firstly pan powder was swollen by bmimcl at room temperature to give a white little viscous pulp . figure 1 shows the process of the dissolution of pan with ionic liquids bmimcl at 90c at the concentration of 10 wt . steady state rheological measurements were performed on a haake rs150l rotational rheometer using a 35 mm 1 cone and plate . according to the so called power law equation where k and n are constants for pseudoplastic liquids the viscosity should decrease nearly linearly with shear rate on the log log plot and the value of n is less than one . however it is surprising to find that the data of panbmimcl solution should be considered having two linear stages see figure 2 . it is known that n is used to indicate the non newtonian property of fluids . at high concentration the rheological behavior of panbmimcl solutions acts like that of liquid crystalline polymers lcp . besides it could be found in figure 3 that when at high shear rate the viscosity of high concentration solutions is lower than that of low concentration for example the viscosity of 22wt solution is the lowest among all the solutions when the shear rate is close to 1000 1s . as we known liquid crystalline polymers usually have rigid chain segment such as aromatic polyamide and aromatic polyester . and the amount of entanglements is so large that there is no enough time and much more difficulties for most of them to slip and disengage . commonly the viscosity follows the andrade or arrhenius equation to a good approximation in this equation a is a constant e is the activation energy . the slope of the straight line plotted by ln versus 1t is e r . the value of the energy of activation depends strongly on whether the viscosities at various temperatures are evaluated at constant shear stress or at constant shear rate . here since low molecular weight polymers has fewer entanglements than high molecular weight ones it is not surprising that deviations from newtonian behavior start at higher shear rates for the low molecular weight solutions . correspondingly the term g called the loss modulus is the out of phase component of the modulus and represents the energy dissipated as heat per cycle of deformation . the data shows that the loss modulus g is much higher than the storage modulus g. either module increases when the concentration increases or the temperature decreases . the data in fig . 7 shows that the complex viscosity angular frequency curves for the panbmimcl solutions of different concentrations90ca and temperature14wtb . . first the decreased viscosity makes the polymer solution easier to process or squirt through small channels such as spinning . as a result there is strong interaction between the cation and the nitrogen atom on the nitrile grouping .", "however it can be an inconvenient study with need for multiple projections to adequately demonstrate the fistula and its course . also being a luminal study the cause of the

the elderly they are most frequently seen with an intrathoracic malignancy and are most commonly associated with malignancy of the esophagus . in a large case series subsequent ulceration and necrosis of the malignant tissue leads to tissue breakdown and fistula formation . however in the indian subcontinent where the incidence of tuberculosis is high chest tuberculosis should be high in the list of differentials when a non malignant fistula is encountered . since the oral and pharyngeal phases of deglutition take no more than 2 seconds the acquisition can be triggered immediately after the

of the movement toward hospital cost containment in the last decade has been the replacement of expensive inpatient care with less costly outpatient care . cost finding methodologies are complex allowing hospitals considerable discretion in cost allocation patterns . an intended consequence of pps was the substitution of less expensive outpatient care for inpatient care without compromise of quality . new techniques in cataract extraction and cardiac catheterization for example have made it possible for people to undergo these procedures without an overnight stay . in 1984 49 percent of community hospitals reported having an organized outpatient department . another group of models following the work of mcfadden 1978 employs flexible functional forms that regress total cost on output levels and input prices and hence are more consistent with the characteristics of the standard economic theory of production . the majority of data used in this analysis comes from two independent sources the american hospital association 1984 88 aha annual survey of hospitals and the hcfa hospital cost reporting information system hcris data files . the hcris files are cycles one through five 1984 88 of pps supplemented by the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act tefra data set which was used to complete the pps data for 1984 . if capital is exogenous it will be uncorrelated with the error term in the cost function . although still imperfect it improves on many earlier cost studies that relied on cruder case mix measures . 1987 found that the county is an acceptable alternative to a uniform geographic area in defining markets . our service index approach to economies of scope differs from that of grannemann brown and pauly 1986 who include interaction terms between output pairs . finally dummy variables are included for teaching status population size and ownership . population of a hospital s surrounding community was coded by collapsing the metropolitan statistical area msa size into one of three groups large urban more than 1 million small urban 100000 to 1 million and rural . a useful procedure for detecting this violation of ols assumptions in the case of a multiple output cost function is the park glejser test see vitaliano 1987 for another application of this test to a hospital cost function . glejser 1969 generalizes the test to allow for the case of heteroscedasticity in which the error term is proportional to more than one of the explanatory variables . the inverse of the diagonal matrix contains the weights to be used in a weighted least squares wls regression . consequently wls regressions were performed for those years and ols was applied to 1987 . small rural markets tend to have lower input prices and because the only included input price is the wage index it is possible that the herfindahl measure could be incorporating the effect of omitted input price measures . previous authors grannemann brown and pauly 1986 vita 1990 failed to find evidence of complementarities among their specific measured outputs . as seen in the final column inpatient costs grew at an average annual rate of 6.6 percent and outpatient costs at a rate of 7.4 percent . additional econometric evidence of economies of scale appears in a study of the determinants of 1987 medicare hospital outpatient department costs by miller 1992 . because these operations are relatively costly it might be expected that they would drive up the average cost of a hospital outpatient visit . despite the focus on growth in ambulatory surgery it should be noted that such surgery comprises a relatively small portion of total outpatient volume . some states have instituted their own non medicare cost containment regulations that do not permit rate increases but do allow for volume adjustments . although the estimated equation is a variable cost function that excludes capital expenditures it is questionable whether a remaining non capital element of measured costs that is fixed with relation to number of discharges and number of outpatient visits could be significant . however the trends that are observed during the 4year period of study would hold assuming that the nature of fixed and joint costs is stable over time . another approach to disaggregation of cost components is that taken by aha in its method for representing multiple hospital outputs in a single measure . aha adjusts inpatient days by the same adjustment factor . however the authors counsel the use of charge data . if historical charge data are used for weighting of outpatient payment groups the system could be seriously distorted in favor of those procedures for which charges have been set well above costs . cost allocation patterns also have research implications particularly for the results of studies that rely on aha revenue ratio adjusted output measures .", "a total of 291study participants 97 wt children and 194 healthy controls based on an

with cancer with higher hb levels who are receiving esa were also addressed in many trials.2223 in addition the possible immunosuppressive effects of blood product transfusions that may have relevance to neoplasia progression were addressed before.24 25 in our pilot study we tested the feasibility of using iron supplementation alone to treat anemia in patients with cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy without the use of esas or blood transfusion which could be a valid alternative especially for patients with curable cancers . a large prospective safety comparison trial failed to show serious anaphylactoid reactions27 which is confirmed in our study in which no patients developed reactions and no patients withdrew from the study because of adverse effects .", " among this

generally and non specifically inhibited by pesticides they also are a likely source of candidate molecules that could be inhibited for target specific insect control since multiple classes of insect immunity genes including signaling pathways can be under strong selection for diversification . after amps are translated in the cytoplasm they are released into the hemolymph where their high concentrations and broad activity are thought to enhance clearance of invading microorganisms from the insect . bioinformatic and experimental data support the existence of the amp inducing toll and imd pathways in lepidopterans though not all components have been identified in model organisms such as m. sexta 32 35 . for example the lepidopteran grp2 which binds fungal cell wall 13 glucans and lta is absent from diptera . also for both m. sexta and b. mori there is experimental evidence linking the toll pathway with amp induction 116118 . genes encoding lysozyme moricin and defensin amps also were up regulated in the midgut of b. mori in the wandering stage consistent with the possibility that amp induction is imd mediated . finally in the lepidopteran beet armyworm spodoptera exigua rnai mediated knockdown of relish expression resulted in loss of cecropin induction upon fungal infection further strengthening the idea that the imd pathway may contribute to amp gene expression in lepidoptera though perhaps it is triggered by distinct signals .", "antiepileptic drug levels were within therapeutic range free phenytoin 1.3 g ml levetiracetam 5.9 g ml and lamotrigine 2.3 g ml .

beginning a combination therapy of apheresis statins and probucol . additionally almost all patients were interested in learning more about alternative treatments suggesting that they would prefer an alternative treatment which could match the results provided by apheresis . by defining the observational period initial time point as the first documented ehr visit we excluded 20 events before apheresis and 2 events after apheresis from the cardiac event rate calculation . although lipid apheresis was performed every two weeks ldl values were not measured ever two weeks due to clinical

pathological description of ad because of the lack of edema and lymphocyte infiltration 911 17 18 . because of apoe s essential genetic and therefore presumably biochemical contribution to ad pathology and cognitive decline it is critical that its role in the ad pathogenic pathway amyloid cascade be elucidated in order for therapeutics based on apoe to be designed . because apoe expression and lipidation is stimulated by lxr activation the results were interpreted as proof that increased apoe levels help microglia clear a and amyloid as indeed some earlier cell culture experiments had suggested . if apoe is an amyloid catalyst then reducing apoe levels or function in the brain should result in reduced amyloid deposition and reduced cognitive decline . all experiments carried out so far in vitro or in transgenic mice indicate that the ability of a to form neurotoxic filaments or oligomers and cause cognitive decline are increased in the presence of apoe particularly mouse apoe and human apoe4 with apoe2 being protective . because apoe clearly has the ability to catalyze the conversion of a into oligomeric and polymeric structures it is reasonable to assume that those structures will be more difficult to clear and that such difficulty will be detected as clearance inhibition in the brain for instance by apoe4 in pulse chase type experiments while the higher apoe levels in blood may aid the clearance of a from the circulations figure 1 . furthermore the inflammatory cytokine il1 that is overexpressed in ad brain induces astrocyte expression of act and blocking il1 expression in app transgenic mice by ibuprofen treatment thereby reducing mouse act expression lowers amyloid formation and restores cognition .", " fractures are frequent in the elderly and

longer and ages they will be unhealthy and pose a greater burden on health systems . countries have long reported causes of death or mortality statistics based on who s 1992 international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems icd10 . a considerable academic literature built up around clinical and other uses of the icidh but much of this literature was critical of the underlying model of disability . after presentation before the executive board in december 2000 the classification was put on the agenda of the fifty fourth world health assembly and renamed the icf . a health condition may also include other circumstances such as pregnancy aging stress congenital anomaly or genetic predisposition . domains are a practical meaningful set of related physiological

relation with social impairment and hypochondriasis table 3 . a qualitative study showed that iranian infertile couples show emotional reactions such as fear concern anxiety and depression as a result of fear of the failure of treatment during fertility treatment . positive correlation between the level of depression and anxiety and other dimensions of experiences during infertility treatment might be accompanied with social impairment thus affecting the levels of depression and anxiety . although this research did not evaluate mental health before and after the beginning of gnrh agonists but this might explain women s psychological disorders before ovulation stimulation regarding high frequency of mental disorders at the time of ovulation stimulation . another finding of this research was

for the photoswitching observed in dronpa.47 this is supported by the fact that mutating either val157 or met159 with smaller residues accelerates photoswitching presumably by decreasing steric hindrance to cistrans isomerization.48 the m159 t and v157 g mutations also decrease the quantum yield of dronpa from 0.85 to quantum yields of 0.23 and 0.77 respectively.48 recently it has been suggested that adoption of a trans configuration can not solely be responsible for the nonfluorescent form.49 on the basis of nmr analyses miyawaki et al . in pyp the asymmetric proteinchromophore interaction probably serves as the initial accelerant for the light induced photocycle50 which ultimately leads to a cistrans isomerization.51 the chromophore in wild type gfp is planar due its extended system see figure 1 however the energy barrier to deformation is low and the protein matrix in wild type gfp exerts some strain away from planarity . as shown in figure 2 gfp adopts two states the neutral state a of the chromophore with the phenolic oxygen protonated and the anionic species b the change from forms a to i is solely a protonation change while the change from i to b is a conformational change with most changes occurring at thr203.67 in order to see whether the gfp chromophore has different dihedral freedom in forms a b and i we conducted molecular dynamical simulations with a freely rotating chromophore as described in the . figure 5 and table 1 show that the chromophore in bfp has significantly more rotational freedom than that available to the chromophore in gfp and that the bfp cavity is less complementary to a planar chromophore than the gfp cavity is that is the bfp sampled structures are further from a planar chromophore 0 and the intercept for the best fit line through the bfp structures is further from the origin than that of gfp . 73 the resultant mutant yfp is red shifted by 16 nm relative to gfp s65 t and does indeed have a stacking interaction between the chromophore and tyr203.74 on the basis of the crystal structure of yfp remington et al . a plot of the distance vs the angle between the phenol planes in our freely rotating simulation and the csd structures shows that the protein matrix of yfp restricts the distance between tyr66 and tyr203 from being larger than 4.18 but that the angles between the two phenols have as much freedom in yfp as in the small molecule structures with intermolecular distances of less than 4.18 see figure 9 .", " especially in this setting a negative mutation result can be either due to the true absence of the mutation in the tumor cells or insufficient percent tumor cellularity that falls below the analytic sensitivity threshold thereby resulting in the failure to detect the mutation even despite the presence of the mutation . sanger sequencing is also relatively more labor intensive and time consuming than targeted methods and can lead to longer turnaround times . in contrast to the general sanger sequencing approach targeted mutation detection methods such as pcr restriction fragment length polymorphism real time pcr pyrosequencing high resolution melting analysis hrma and pcr fragment analysis can be utilized . as mentioned previously ffpe cell blocks represent the traditional cytopreparatory platform on which ancillary molecular diagnostic tests are performed . alk gene loci that have not undergone rearrangement typically display fused orange and green signals yellow or juxtaposed touching orange and green signals . as mentioned previously paraffin embedded cell blocks are processed similarly to paraffin embedded tissue blocks thus cell blocks are traditionally used for the performance of alk rearrangement fish assays . emerging

extracapsular cataract extraction with phacoemulsification via temporal clear corneal and a single superior side port incision . about 10 seconds after the injection we recognized the mistake and the anterior chamber was irrigated with 100ml of a balanced salt solution cytosol ophthalmicstm for one minute . oral prednisolone 20 mg and ofloxacin 300 mg were used as well . almost every ocular drug can be potentially toxic to the corneal endothelium and the risk of endothelial toxicity is increased when used in the anterior chamber because of its direct contact to the endothelium . besides irreversible damage to the corneal endothelium and corneal edema high concentrations of gentamicin solutions can induce retinal hemorrhage edema and obliteration of the retinal vasculature when injected in the vitreous resulting in optic atrophy retinal pigment degeneration or neovascular glaucoma.1718 in our case the toxicity of the gentamicin to the corneal endothelium was expected to be significant due to the fact that the concentration of the gentamicin injected in anterior chamber and corneal stroma was 40 times more than that of previously mentioned studies . in our case we reported a favorable visual outcome with immediate irrigation of the anterior chamber with a balanced salt solution after the inadvertent injection of high dose antibiotics and steroids .",

preventing and treating it the need to more research is felt .", "a retrospective analysis was conducted using data collected from patients who received milrinone treatment for 3 days at the seoul national university children s hospital from january 2005 to december 2012 . in total 2299 eligible admissions were identified during the study period . accordingly the most common type of surgery was closure of the ventricular septal defect followed by repair of tetralogy of fallot and coarctoplasty . although diverse arrhythmias occurred in 75 10.3 admissions only 3 0.4 required reduction or discontinuation of milrinone infusion to alleviate arrhythmia . based on univariate logistic regression analysis of group a data the following parameters were associated with the development of arrhythmia male gender age 3 months and cardiopulmonary bypass time 180 minutes . although the korean national insurance covers only 35 hours of milrinone use we found that milrinone was frequently prescribed for a longer duration in actual settings suggesting a significant off label use . furthermore only 3 0.4 of the 715 admissions in group a experienced hypotension that required a reduction in milrinone infusion rate . cardiopulmonary bypass is known to be associated with thrombocytopenia that results from hemodilution and mechanical disruption.27 in the present study patients who developed thrombocytopenia had a longer cardiopulmonary bypass time and aorta clamping time .", "brown squard syndrome bss which occurs due to dysfunction of the spinothalamic tract typically reflects the hemisection of the spinal cord at the cervical or thoracic level . among the multiple etiologies the most common cause is penetrating trauma such as a gunshot78 . a 25year old machine operator was involved in a violent episode and was stabbed in his right neck with an electric screw driver bit that was thrown by the opponent . an immediate interventional angiography was undertaken without general anesthesia due to the nature of the emergency . the neurological motor function of the right upper and lower extremities recovered to 35 and 45 respectively with persistent decreased sensory

os junction and thinning of the onl were clearly demonstrated by sd oct . better oct findings correlated to better vision prompt treatment at disease onset and less incidence of systemic corticosteroids andor immunosuppressant at 12 months after onset . clinical findings of late vkh patients vary greatly . all eyes displaying intact cost lines displayed normal is os junctions or rpe layers whereas those displaying intact is os junctions or normal rpe layers displayed disrupted cost lines . a former paper reported a similar correlation in patients with macular holes 12 20 .", " a common observation when complex proteomes are analyzed is that the lists of proteins identified are often quite variable which has raised concerns about the general value of proteomics for most applications if it actually does have poor reproducibility . all data were consistently analyzed and filtered as described in materials and methods which resulted in estimated false positive rates fpr calculated by dividing reverse hit peptide counts by forward hit peptide counts of 1.6 and 1.4 for 2d and 3d data respectively . a nonredundant peptide counts from a single 2d analysis combined data from increasing numbers of replicate analyses and the 3d method . a among proteins common to both data sets 491 proteins were identified by two peptides in the 2d repetitive data set . a similar increase 61 was observed in repetitive mudpit using nine analyses.10 as expected the greatest positive impact on proteome coverage was use of a second replicate run which increased the number of proteins identified by two or more peptides by 33 while doubling instrument time . although producing more fractions per gel lane increases the number of in gel digestions the overall increase in total analysis time for a proteome is minor . a recent study suggested good reproducibility was achievable across 27 laboratories on a simple 20protein mixture after uniform data processing was used.35 but this simple sample of abundant proteins at the same concentration does not reflect real biological complexity .", " as several authors have noted further studies are required to understand

treated the setting in which treatment is delivered including the funding arrangements and costs incurred the attitudes and perceptions of staff about the treatment and the other psychological and physical disorders diseases and disabilities that may co occur with the condition being treated . a final benchmark was an outpatient evaluation of group cbt for depressed patients treated within diagnostically heterogenous groups . comparing the present results with those of in the depressed outpatient sample it is apparent that inpatients were more severe at admission than the outpatient population i.e. although the changes during the cbt program are comparable to those in published studies one possible interpretation of the present findings is that the patients would have improved to the same degree due to their hospital stay . follow up tests revealed no significant differences between groups at admission but the patients who had completed cbt were less depressed m 13.1 than those who never began cbt m 16.6 t611 2.56 p .05 who in turn were not different from those who had dropped out of cbt m 16.9 t516 0.10 p ns . assuming a degree of symptom specificity of treatments because cbt is focussed on symptoms of depression and anxiety the changes in these domains should be greater during cbt whereas the earlier phase in an inpatient admission will be focussed on acute symptom management . although there was no difference in bdi scores before and after cbt between patients with more secondary medical conditions f6146 1.67 .06 p ns there was a hint that patients with

similar finding has also been demonstrated by aziz1 in the ramadan study with the lowest prevalence of hypoglycemia 4.58 . these agents drugs reduce serum glucose concentrations and improve the glycemic control by augmenting the effects of incretins hence this strategy is also called incretin based therapy for diabetes management . as the dpp4 inhibitors contrary to this normal physiology in diabetic patients the balance between insulin secretion and hepatic glucose production is dysregulated . in type 1 diabetic subjects there is absolute insulin deficiency due to autoimmunity against cells with destruction of these cells as compared with type 2 diabetic subjects who exhibit relative insulin deficiency with insulin resistance.2526 furthermore absolute or relative hyperglucagonemia due to deficiency of incretin hormones in diabetic state is a hallmark of both type 1 and type 2 diabetic subjects.2728 in other words in type 2 diabetic subjects there is insulin resistance and hyperglucagonemia . however this risk was significantly reduced when vildagliptin was prescribed during ramadan fasting and this has also been recently reported in indo pakistani populations from the uk and in cohorts of uk south asian muslim patients in the vector vildagliptin experience compared to gliclazide observed during ramadan study.4042 furthermore in general these agents have also been demonstrated to be safer in older age group.43 a recent observational study which combined metformin and vildagliptin therapy together with or without ohas during ramadan fasting has demonstrated advantage of reduced hypoglycemia incidence.44 they have shown one case of severe hypoglycemia in the arm treated with oha compared to the vildagliptin group which showed no hypoglycemia event . the hypoglycemia events were 12 times more in the group treated with oha as compared to the vildagliptin group . a recent review published in switzerland and france has studied worldwide the role of dpp4 inhibitors including vildagliptin during ramadan fasting and has come to the conclusion that the anti diabetic agents dpp4 inhibitors could be a more safer option while managing type2 diabetes during ramadan fasting with a very low risk of hypoglycemia.47 another prospective noninterventional study published in france to assess real life rate of hypoglycemia during ramadan fasting in patients with type 2 diabetes and their ongoing dual therapy of metformin vildagliptin or metformin sulfonylurea has shown that hypoglycemia as an adverse events aes was higher in su group as compared to

excretion of ctx was significantly lower in aged mice than in young mice fed the high p diet . however it is generally known that age related increase in serum pth contributes to the increase in bone resorption . a decline in intestinal ca absorption is also one of the causes of age related bone loss . from the results of bone resorption and formation markers high bone turnover with resorption exceeding formation since high bone turnover is a risk factor for bone fracture and osteoporosis a high p diet might be a risk factor for bone loss not only in young mice but also in aged mice . although the mechanism underlying the high p diet induced decreased ca absorption remains unknown it is thought that the formation of insoluble ca and p salts in the intestinal lumen is an important factor . furthermore the high p diet affected pth secretion differently in young and aged mice leading to an increase in the rankl opg mrna ratio in aged mice .", " despite advancements in modern

assembly properties of rbps puts them at risk of aggregating during aging in a multicellular organism and not just in the context of disease . by western blot we confirmed that reduced daf2 signaling abrogated their aggregation with age figures 1e and s2b . because of the small size of the age dependent stress granule like puncta it was not possible to assess the mobility of tiar2 or pab1 in these structures . furthermore we did not observe a general induction of pab1 stress granules in young double transgenic animals expressing both kin19 and pab1 figure s6j . as yet it remains unclear whether reduced fitness is a cause or consequence of pab1 aggregation . apart from accelerating pathology indirectly by reducing cellular health the presence of stress granule proteins in pathological protein

reported results are likely a function of the wearer s ability to maintain homeostasis of their tear film overcoming the drying effect of contact lenses.10 it appears that certain procedures may influence tear osmolarity more than others . in a recent 2013 article no change in tear osmolarity or any other dry eye diagnostic test was observed after refractive surgery despite a decrease in corneal sensitivity.26 after cataract surgery tear osmolarity has been noted to increase.27 the difference here may be explained by the subjects ages average age was 26 years in the refractive surgery study26 and 71 years in the cataract surgery study.27 older patients may take longer to recover from surgically induced ocular trauma.27 trabeculectomy surgery performed on a patient population with an average age of 71 years also had higher tear osmolarity than a control group this result was attributed to the presence of the bleb the use of mitomycin c which may cause epithelial damage or the residual effects of long term use of glaucoma medications before surgery.28 no difference in tear osmolarity was noted between the eye that underwent eyelid reconstruction surgery and the un operated eye of the same patient this result may be related with corrective tearing as evidenced by the higher schirmer s test results in the operated eye.29 table 4 shows studies that investigated the effect of various ocular and systemic conditions on tear osmolarity . of the systemic conditions diabetes was found to increase tear osmolarity.3031 an increase in tear osmolarity was correlated with an increase in diabetes duration . for instance eyes with pseudoexfoliation syndrome a condition that is thought to alter goblet cell activity and mucin production have been reported to have increased tear osmolarity when compared to a control group.38 patients with pterygia a predominantly inflammatory condition also show increased tear osmolarity when compared with a control group.39 keratoconus has been demonstrated to reduce corneal sensitivity but tear osmolarity was similar to a control group . it may also be due to the difference in disease severity of the tested groups given the strong correlation between tear osmolarity and disease severity.911 the more severe the ded the higher the threshold and the greater the variability in the tear osmolarity value.9 the currently agreed upon value that discriminates between healthy and dry eyes is when the higher tear film osmolarity value of the two eyes is 308 mosm l.510 as with any diagnostic tool interpretation must be based on the complete clinical picture including other diagnostic tests that might be helpful in determining the dry eye etiology.10 certain commonly encountered external factors such as contact lens wear may or may not increase tear osmolarity depending on the individual response.224 the impact of environmental factors such as temperature humidity and airflow on tear osmolarity appears unclear as is the effect of sex hormones these factors would benefit from further investigation.2021253637 the effect of ocular surgery on tear osmolarity may be partially dependent on the patient s age the type of surgery performed and the ability of the eye to recover.2629 systemic conditions commonly believed to result in dry eye such as dehydration diabetes and thyroid ophthalmopathy have been shown to increase tear osmolarity as expected.313235 ocular conditions such as herpetic keratitis pterygia and pseudoexfoliation syndrome have also been demonstrated to increase tear osmolarity.383941 keratoconus largely viewed clinically as a non inflammatory condition was not associated with increased tear osmolarity.40 some pharmaceuticals such as mucin altering drugs and glaucoma medications appear to increase tear osmolarity while others such as artificial tears likely lower tear osmolarity.202843 research into the effect of anti inflammatory medications on tear osmolarity has produced varied results the topic deserves further investigation.484951 there are limitations in any review of this nature and consequently to any of our comments related to the factors associated with osmolarity . by confining the review to tear osmolarity related discussions of some of the dry eye issues such as the effect of hormones in some papers will have been missed .", " anemia which can be defined as hemoglobin less than 13 g dl or hematocrit less than 36 is a relatively common preoperative finding . anemia is especially prevalent in patients with cancer and treatment plans often include surgery . a low initial hemoglobin level measured at disease presentation is a risk factor for further development of anemia throughout the course of treatment . endogenous erythropoietin normally stimulates the bone marrow to increase red blood cell rbc mass under hypoxic conditions but if this nonhemodynamic response to hypoxia is impaired then hemoglobin levels do not rebound sufficiently . although allogeneic blood is now reportedly safer than ever safety issues with the blood supply still exist . first the eligible donor pool is shrinking and second surgery in these

with the past medical history of diabetes coronary artery disease and psoriasis presented with acute onset of diffuse abdominal pain 2 days prior to admission to the hospital . because the patient s vital signs stabilized after being resuscitated the decision was made to obtain a ct scan to better assess the location of the perforated viscus . although a rare disease splenic abscess should be included on the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting to the hospital with peritonitis or pneumoperitoneum . in retrospect an open laparotomy was the best approach to this patient s care as it allowed for better visualization and irrigation of the abdominal cavity . although our transesophageal echocardiogram and panorex were both negative we believe this splenic abscess developed as a result of translocation of the oral flora as the patient was complaining of a tooth ache 1 week prior to her presentation . although there is still controversy in the current literature when managing splenic abscesses our recommendation is splenectomy especially in the case of ruptured splenic abscess resulting in hemodynamic instability .", "a precise understanding of prognostic factors is

mediators and exogenous substances released under homeostatic or pathologic conditions such as asthma . because of these associations with immune responses many researchers have hypothesized that icam1 could function in signal transduction . activation of pkc causes decreased collagen expression via the extracellular signal regulated kinase kinase mekerk signaling cascade a response that is opposed by pkc . because multiple signaling pathways contribute to the key cellular responses important in lung biology therapeutic strategies targeting pkcs may be more effective if combined with inhibitors of other pathways for additive or synergistic effect . cell surface tyrosine kinases receptors play pivotal roles in development tissue repair and normal cellular homeostasis . both acute

increasing costs of healthcare expenditures over the next 10 years i.e. by multiplying diabetes population figures by the per capita healthcare expenditures the total healthcare budget for people diagnosed with diabetes is derived . analysis of the 1992 2010 moh database suggests that the number of people diagnosed with diabetes increased by 1.6 million or 183 during the last 18 years . comparison of the 2010 diabetes figure to the 1992 figure suggests that the net number of people diagnosed with diabetes is growing by about 0.1 million per year . it is important to mention that the population age 60 years and above represents the highest percentage increase among population diagnosed with diabetes during the last 18 years of analysis . although the population diagnosed with diabetes comprises more than 9 of the saudi population in 2010 almost 1 in 11 people in saudi arabia having diabetes and if the present prevalence rate remains unchanged over time the ratio of people with to without diabetes will increase by almost 1 in 5 people having the disease in 2020 . although the diabetes cost estimates presented in this research study might be conservative for several reasons omitted from this analysis due to data limitations is the number of people who reported that they had diabetes in both private and other governmental e.g.", " of these participants 3664 were

right eye while the treating physician attempted to remove the residual rust ring after removal of a piece of metallic foreign body . after 48 h of treatment there was no significant improvement in the right eye . concerns were raised about possible complications such as secondary angle closure glaucoma and prolonged hypotony . as the wound was completely punched out injected viscoelastic materials in the anterior chamber came out from the wound which made it quite difficult to dry the surface of the cornea for application of tissue adhesive . therefore to provide a necessary support for the gluing amniotic membrane plugging was tried but it was too slippery to be fixed on the wound . a blunt 27gauge needle with a 2mm bent tip attached to a viscoelastic injecter was gently inserted into the anterior chamber through the paracentesis . a second advantage of this technique is that the iris is introduced to the perforation site from inside the eye in a controlled manner to prevent excessive iris prolapse and provide a stable support for the tissue adhesive .", "however this view has been challenged and a recent large scale study has shown that relatives of individuals affected with schizophrenia have increased risks of bipolar disorder and vice versa . although these findings were interesting incomplete penetrance of the mutations and lack of power made the results equivocal . a burden analysis study of approximately 200 affected individuals identified two translocation events at nrxn1 in separate samples one disrupting the coding sequence and the other lying 5 to the gene . a further study of over 1000 pedigrees using approximately 10000 single nucleotide polymorphisms snps identified a 300 kb deletion of coding exons of nrxn1 co segregating with autism . a whole genome screen for large chromosomal abnormalities using array cgh performed in 93 individuals with schizophrenia identified a hemizygous loss at nrxn1 in one case . although the available data provide relatively strong evidence that disruption of the neurexin1 locus nrxn1 is a risk factor for schizophrenia and asds evidence in relation to bipolar disorder is lacking . deletions of neurexin result in increased lethality normal synapse number and gross anatomy but severely impaired synaptic functioning a pattern strikingly similar to neuroligin gene knockouts . further work on the biology of neurexins neuroligins and related proteins is certainly required and it seems likely that the pathogenic roles of these proteins will be illuminated by further human genetic studies .", " an accurate determination of the absence of fever in a child assures parents and saves cost by preventing unnecessary investigations and medication . in a study in new york usa of the 78 of caregivers

this underscores the fact that the use of palpation as a means of assessing fever by mothers is common and universal . children under the age of 5 years presenting for care with their mothers were recruited for the study . frequencies percentages and mean were analysed where appropriate . a sensitivity of 82.4 obtained in this study is similar to those reported by okposio and abhulimhen iyoha

study and that of okposio and abhulimhen iyoha8 used axillary temperature of 37.5c as the definition of fever . although palpation overestimates fever the elicitation of fever by mothers would encourage early presentation as it has been documented that the concern for fever is a strong motivational factor for seeking medical care.2 the educational qualification of a mother did not influence

discussion suggests there are several hypothetical reasons why the sglt2 transporter represents an opportune target for managing blood glucose . a detailed summary of clinical findings has recently been published.55 the mechanism of action of sglt2 inhibitors predicts a beneficial effect but the long term glucose lowering capacity in a clinical setting may not impart significant reductions in hba1c . although the sglt2 inhibitors mechanism of action would make them suitable for initial monotherapy in patients with early stage t2 dm it is unlikely they would be considered at this stage . by promoting an escape mechanism for glucose sglt2 inhibitors introduce a new mode to the control of t2 dm . insulin dependent therapies become less effective with the development of insulin resistance andor deterioration of cell function particularly in patients with low insulin resistance high glucose or poorly controlled disease . by increasing excretion of glucose sglt2 inhibitors offer an opportunity to increase calorie loss in t2 dm patients most of whom are overweight . in a clinical setting it would be easy to overcome any benefits that patients may derive from sglt2 inhibition if they perceived the drug as a means of acclimatized to higher levels of plasma glucose would experience a marked change in appetite with substantial loss of glucose calories.67 one final issue is that for these drugs to work they need to be delivered to the epithelial luminal surface of the nephron requiring them to be cleared by the glomerulus .", " a blinded two member clinical event committee

study shows that atf6 also contributes in an xpb1s independent manner to lipid biogenesis and er expansion an er stress response which was thought to be predominantly mediated by the irei pathway . accumulation of pip3 seems to be crucial for the recruitment of autophagy proteins such as atg18wipi1 to the i m which is important for atg9 trafficking and therefore for the initiation of the

" endoscopic injection is frequently used now as a firstline treatment because it involves less pain and a shorter hospitalization period and leaves no scar in contrast to open reimplantation . however when an injection treatment fails open ureteral reimplantation should be considered for treating persistent vur . among them 64 underwent open reimplantation as a primary procedure group a and 17 underwent it after failed endoscopic injection group b . all patients were classed in terms of preoperative reflux grade using voiding cystourethrography vcug . however group a still had more patients with high grade reflux after endoscopic surgery than did group b p0.020 . as seen above endoscopic treatment of children with vur had many advantages and a high success rate but there were also many failures especially in the children with more severe reflux . however there were no significant differences in operation time postoperative complications hospitalization period or surgical

brain stem infarction bulbar palsy motor neuron disease peripheral neuropathy huntington s chorea parkinson s disease multiple sclerosis myasthenia gravis or muscle disease.4 the second may be attributable to congenital traumatic inflammatory tumors or post operative lesions of the vocal cords . dysarthria due to hypothyroidism had been reported only once previous to this case.3 the pathophysiology of dysarthria in hypothyroidism can be explained by edematous swelling of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal structures in combination with macroglossia.3 it has been shown that macroglossia in hypothyroidism is caused by a thickening of the epithelial tissue.6 these changes can also explain the choking and the dysphagia which this patient experienced .", " apart from this the greater

inappropriate use of inpatient hospital care improve continuity of care and enhance the client s quality of life in the community franklin et al . a brief examination of the role of case management within the local service network suggests at least three phases in the formalization and centralization of these support services . as more community hospitals including the kaiser hospital physicians home care agencies and other providers became involved with aids care informal approaches to case coordination became much more difficult . case management services are offered to pwa s and persons with severe arc . although san francisco has embraced what has come to be known as a brokering model of case management under which case management involves gaining access to and coordinating existing services communities with fewer available aids services have adopted a direct service model wright sklebar and heiman 1987 in which case managers not only plan for care but directly provide those services not otherwise available to pwa s . although many factors besides case management explain the shorter length of stay in san francisco scitovsky cline and lee 1986 arno and hughes 1987 there remains reason to believe that in other communities aids may prove the exception to prior findings on the limited impact of case management by demonstrating that these services can shorten hospital stays and thus reduce the overall costs of caring for persons with aids .", " a classical paradigm has been the fact that the more adipose tissue the higher the prevalence of metabolic diseases and it is this relationship that has interested researchers . although in early obesity there is an increase in lipogenic gene expression to store fat rapidly in long term obese subjects this expression decreases perhaps due to a late adaptive process aimed at limiting further development of fat mass . a possible explanation for this reversal is that once the storage capacity of the adipocytes is reached the cells reduce their ability to synthesize additional fatty acids following a natural inhibitory feed back process . a recent collaboration has found an adaptive response to compensate the antilipogenic effect associated with ir maintaining lipid desaturation through preferential scd1 regulation and facilitating fat storage in adipose tissue . another example of up regulated molecules in obesity is rab18 which is a gtpase that has been found to regulate intracellular membrane bidirectional trafficking of lipids in lipid droplets it is involved in the mechanism to release lipids from lipid droplets in adipocytes . adipocytes are the main units in adipose tissue and this tissue is considered to control the whole body metabolism so dysregulation can have huge consequences for health . however it has been noticed that morbidly obese patients have this process endangered in the same way that occurs with caspases and bcl2 proteins or tweak and trail concerning to apoptosis or

parameters for maternal and fetal outcomes were noted . a statistically significant and direct correlation was also found between serum uric acid and spot urine p c ratio r 0.355 p 0.002 table 2 . a stillbirth occurred in a patient with severe preeclampsia induced at 30 weeks who had significant proteinuria 534 g day a spot p c ratio of 0.9 and normal serum uric acid levels . 24h urine protein estimation has been considered the gold standard for testing proteinuria but has the disadvantage of consuming time delaying diagnosis and thus delaying initiation of appropriate management . in 120 preeclamptic women the mean age was 26 years and mean gestational age was 32 weeks . but overall the differences in maternal and fetal outcomes related to 24h urine protein levels greater than or less than 300 mg did not attain statistical significance . he concluded that serum uric acid is a poor predictor of maternal and fetal complications in women with preeclampsia .", " acute liver failure alf can be caused by the ingestion of mushrooms containing exceptionally powerful hepatotoxins . even if phallotoxins are highly toxic to liver cells they add little to the amanita phalloides toxicity as they are not adsorbed from the intestine and do not reach the liver . about 60 of absorbed amanitin is excreted into the bile and is returned to the liver via the enterohepatic circulation 4 1115 . 3648 h after ingestion signs of liver involvement may appear . a complete analysis of the world experience in treatment of amatoxin poisoning was published in 2002 by enjalbert et al . according to retrospective data most authors indicate that silibinin and n acetylcysteine nac may be effective in the management of patients with amanita phalloides poisoning 1 2 4 21 . administration of silibinin is recommended if the patient is seen within 48 hours of ingestion .", " a number of systemic conditions might predispose patients in developing endogenous endophthalmitis including diabetes mellitus

coexisted with diabetes mellitus and 50 of them had liver abscess . concluded that in endogenous klebsiella endophthalmitis presence of hypopyon and unilateral involvement are associated with poorer prognosis . despite treatment although previous studies suggested that fungal endogenous endophthalmitis was associated with better vision compared with bacterial endogenous endophthalmitis 810 our findings showed no significant difference in the proportion of eyes with fc or better vision at the latest follow up .", "a 46year old woman presented with left side radiculopathy started 2 weeks

type i lesions not related to septal branches or the atrioventricular av node type ii lesions compromising blood supply to septal branches emerging from the left anterior descending artery lad type iii lesions compromising blood supply to the av node and type iv lesions compromising blood supply both to septal branches emerging from the lad and to the av node table 1 . in contrast the rb group

however revascularization of the stenosed coronary artery could not reverse conduction disturbances.56 in the present study status of cad on admission showed significant difference between the ib group and the rb group . as male gender and smoking status are distinct risk factors of cad it seems that gender and smoking status are not major components in the reversibility of avb . by screening all patients with new onset avb who visited our hospital majority of patients had no evidence of cad while only 2 patients presented with unstable angina . avb in patients with cad other than ami is usually irreversible therefore implantation of a pacemaker should be considered on a preferential basis .", " bmi is a reliable indicator for estimation of body fat wherein a high bmi value usually indicates high levels of body fat and vice versa . body weight was recorded with an avery weighing scale accurately to within 50 g. body surface area bsa in square meter m was calculated from the

response amplitude of the sbns was described as a function of saccade direction in 400 saccades by fitting gaussian curves to data see figure 8b in indicating that the sbn lfps can be fine tuned over all the directed saccades . a description of the synaptic properties of the major neural sites involved in execution of a saccade provides the basis for developing quantitative computational models of the neural network . as motoneurons receive excitatory input from the ipsilateral ebn the burst discharge in them during a saccade is adequately similar to the ebn bursting . each neuron s dendrite rise time constant determines the delay to emulate the postsynaptic potential propagation along the dendrite consistent with the initiation of firing with respect to the saccade onset provided in table 1 . as described the number of active neurons impacts the control of saccades instead of the variations in the firing rate of those neurons under the time optimal control strategy . as demonstrated this system parameter is determined by reducing from a maximum of 100 active neurons until the eye position estimate from the mfm and the whole muscle model match . each active neuron exhibits the pause slide step firing trajectory as later shown in figure 11 substantiating the physiological accuracy of the agonist controller model .", " cigarette smoking is a major cause of disease affecting several systems in the human body.12 although reducing cigarette consumption does not improve prognosis3 smoking cessation has important beneficial socioeconomic and health related implications.45 however quitting smoking is a very difficult task . although millions of people use them all over the world there is lack of clinical evidence on their efficacy in reversing smoking related disease and conditions . chronic idiopathic neutrophilia cin is a condition characterized by asymptomatic elevation of white blood cells wbcs and neutrophil count that persists for years without any underlying disease.9 smoking has been implicated as a cause of this condition910 and leukocyte count is a predictor of future cardiovascular events.1112 to the best of our knowledge we report for the first time a case study of a subject with cin that was reversed by smoking cessation with the daily use of electronic cigarettes . although still inadequate research on electronic cigarettes has progressed over the past year . flouris et al19 found that no elevation in wbc count was found after electronic cigarette use in comparison wbc and neutrophil counts were significantly elevated immediately after tobacco cigarette smoking.19 farsalinos et al20 studied smokers and electronic cigarette users with echocardiography before and after smoking and electronic cigarette use respectively.20 acute diastolic dysfunction was observed in smokers immediately after smoking 1 cigarette while diastolic function was preserved after using the electronic cigarette for 7 minutes . despite all this data and the fact that no study has found that electronic cigarettes are more harmful when compared to tobacco cigarettes it must be emphasized that research is still in its infancy . in conclusion we presented a case of a young smoker having cin and low grade inflammation which was reversed after smoking cessation .", " all patients underwent non enhanced ct scans immediately and

although the occurrence of parenchymal hemorrhage after endovascular therapy is multifactorial careful patient selection based on pretreatment imaging studies judicious management of blood pressure and reduced use of contrast agents and thrombolytic drugs during the endovascular procedure are all needed to decrease the occurrence of parenchymal hemorrhage . although this is a novel finding in studies regarding mechanical thrombectomy using stent retrievers a history of previous stroke tia has been found as a predictor of short term and long term mortality in patients with acute ischemic stroke compared with healthy control subjects in observational studies . baseline aspects measured by ct or mri has been found to be an independent predictor of clinical outcome after stent retriever

in addition to the decrease of let7a mir15a and mir16 they also found underexpression of mir21 mir141 mir143 mir145 and mir150 in acth secreting pituitary adenomas compared with normal pituitary tissues . besides mir107 was found to be overexpressed in gh secreting and nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas and inhibited the expression of pituitary tumor suppressor gene aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein aip . mir200c which has been characterized as a tumor suppressor or oncogene in different cancers also inhibited apoptosis in pituitary adenoma cells by targeting the pten akt signaling pathway . deregulation of bmi1 has been revealed to affect apoptosis thus mir128 which was downregulated in gh secreting pituitary tumors could also affect apoptosis by directly regulating bmi1 . although invasion and metastasis are rare in pituitary tumors studies provide some clues of mirnas function in pituitary tumor invasion and metastasis figure 1 . accumulating evidence demonstrates that a large number of mirnas have altered expression in pituitary adenomas and these mirnas may play important roles in tumor progression by targeting multiple genes .", " all of these

systems have been generated how the system learns to recognize new viruses which the components of the systems are and how they are produced how the virus is recognized and destroyed what countermeasures the viruses use and which non immunity processes crispr cas components participate in . further a recent investigation of uncultured microorganisms headed by jillian banfield indicate that in some major bacterial lineages only 10 contain crispr cas systems . in the case of the acid mine drainage viral community early experiment on the role of crispr cas in virus host interaction in laboratory settings was published in 2013 using the bacterial dairy workhorse streptococcus thermophilus and its d2972 phage . another study on the same species demonstrated that in addition to the expected competition between crispr cas immunity and phage escape mutants there were some unanticipated results phages could establish themselves in a culture containing one but not 2 spacers targeting it bacteria without crispr cas immunity persist in cultures despite presence of a large amount of phage and bacteria with 2 spacers targeting a phage could still not establish themselves in a population of phage sensitive bacteria . came from the observation that while phage readily generates escape mutants the dms3vir phages still became extinct after some time in p. aeruginosa cultures . to confirm that the interplay between diversity and immunity was not limited to the type i f crispr cas system of p. aeruginosa the role of diversity in type ii a system on infection of s.

surgery and the macula on during the entire follow up were included . comparing the preoperative characteristics of the overall study patients the g1 patients all of whom were in the macula on group were statistically different for the following table 2 . 3 percentage of previous cataract surgery in g1 is slightly higher . because the central vision was not affected by the rd it is likely that both the patients and the general practitioners underestimated the severity of the disease and that may explain the delayed diagnosis . for our patients with macula on rds the evaluations were made only by indirect ophthalmoscopy or fundus biomicroscopy at 24 or 48 hours prior to the surgery . as mentioned we did not perform oct on patients preoperatively to rule out a subclinical extension of subretinal fluid under the fovea a reason which could explain why some eyes with similar alterations have functional results significantly better than others . first is that the study design was not intended to solve the question of vision loss in patients with macula on rd but in view of the lack of reports on va loss after macula on rd surgery we have considered that our data could be interesting .", " in fact ros may cause severe damages to several cellular macromolecules including proteins lipids and dna thus contributing to the development of many pathological conditions . as sod2 is the primary antioxidant enzyme in mitochondria protecting cells from oxidative injuries we have evaluated the role exerted by this enzyme in sh sy5y cells in the course of diclofenac treatment . a similar picture emerged when sh sy5y cells were incubated with 150 m diclofenac and analysed at different times . as shown in figure 7 the addition of sstrx partially reverted the programmed cell death provoked by the drug . a deeper insight on the involvement of mitochondria in the diclofenac induced apoptosis was realised with a western blotting analysis aimed at the evaluation of the cytochrome c release from mitochondria . also in our neuronal cell system diclofenac provokes an early and significant increase of the intracellular ros levels . also in our system the diclofenac treatment induces an early mitochondrial hypopolarization correlated to an increase of the intracellular ros levels both events representing typical features of the onset of mitochondrial apoptosis .", " the bacterium escherichia coli is widely used as indicator of the bacteriological condition of food and environments due to its almost exclusively fecal origin . according to some authors the

of the tumor to adjacent structures . an immunohistochemical study showed that the tumor was positive for neuroendocrine markers such as cd56 synaptophysin and chromogranin . among the many types of paraganglioma an exclusively dopamine producing type is extremely rare . blood pressure is sometimes elevated after the removal of this tumor presumably because of the same mechanism . because of the rarity of this tumor there are no definite criteria for evaluating its malignant potential .", "a ct angiography showed a dvt in the left mid femoral to popliteal and posterior tibial veins fig . 2c .

further appears that there was no statistically significant difference in support scores between patients with moderate levels of anxiety depression and those with no anxiety depression . adjusted regression to the following factors gender marital status educational level years of problem relations with nursing medical staff and patients and if their lifestyle has been affected . 22 hemodialysis patients experience high levels of anxiety and depression for reasons which limit their independence such as visits to dialysis center every three days connection to dialysis machine diet and fluids restrictions and loss of available time . 22 also stated that among demographic and clinical characteristics those related with anxiety and depression are age diabetes and antidepressants or beta blockers . 26 illustrated that persistently high anxiety and depression are associated with reduced perceived social support . 29 showed that perceived social support from family was negatively correlated with depression . firstly it is essential for health professionals to develop intervention strategies to strengthen hemodialysis patients social networks and secondly to encourage patients to express their feelings and address their psychological needs thus confronting with the psychological burden of the disease .", "for management dilation or stretching of the

as atherosclerosis andor calcification was also recorded . in addition both a morphological evaluation and measurement of the diameter of the svc and inferior vena cava ivc were also performed . in the present study we measured the diameters of the major systemic vessels and compared those data to previously published human data table 1 . accurate preoperative imaging of donor vasculature is of great importance because vascular variations such as accessory arteries and early branching are particularly important when determining optimal organ extraction procedures and the type of anastomosis . angiography using mdct is fast safe minimally invasive and now is routinely used in the preoperative evaluation of potential human donors for renal and liver transplantation .", " add pak2 20 g in 2

is to prevent atp dissociated from pak2 after dilution . inactive pak2 was subjected to h d exchange for 0 10 min and analyzed by maldi tof . identification of the pepsin digested fragments is a critical step of the h d exchange experiment . the back exchange is the inevitable loss of deuteration in all deuterated and pepsin digested peptides in the mass measurement process .", "a step forward in this area has been achieved through the acceptance of the definition of inappropriate test demand that appears to be a request that is made outside some form of agreed guidance 11 . among the several progress a special attention should be deserved to the national minimum retesting interval project promoted by the clinical practice section of the association for clinical biochemistry acb in the uk uses a state of the art approach to set consensus evidence based recommendations on when a test should be repeated . for all these measurands harmonization of available methods and diagnostic systems should be promoted . as test results are increasingly transferred electronically the argument for adopting a single standardized set of units needs immediate uptake 34 . however a body of evidence has been accumulated on the relevance of the extra analytical phases namely the pre analytical steps their vulnerability and impact on the overall quality of the laboratory

" apoptosis was significantly increased in cells treated with pa alone 133 p 0.01 pa versus bsa . 100 nm exendin4 treatment with pa presence resulted in a significant decrease of apoptosis 87 p 0.01 pa ex versus pa . all these results strongly suggested that exendin4 protected min6 cells against lipotoxicity at least in part via activation of erk12 signaling pathway . although roles of exendin4 on cell proliferation and antiapoptosis have been demonstrated in cells its mechanisms are not fully understood . accumulating evidence supports the role of glp1 mimetics and enhancers in regulating proliferation and protecting from cellular apoptosis . after exendin4 treatment we observed that these alterations were partially counteracted figure 3 . further study on the relation between erk12 activation and inhibition of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway may reveal more detailed molecular mechanism of glp1 mediated cytoprotective role on pancreatic cells .", " 2 reasonable questions to ask are whether the various labeling steps alter the original distribution of the mrnas samples and if they do to what extent does this occur in order to address these questions an experiment could be designed utilizing a large quantity of rna from distinct contrasted biological systems . a corollary question was whether every instance of significant change in the steady state level of a particular mrna would suggest a correlation between the activity of the cognate gene and the physiological response . assay validation studies18 concluded that whenever slopes values were greater than 3 they would disqualify the data set for downstream analysis since an advanced degradation of the rna would cause the measurement to be unreliable . altogether these initial explorations allowed for the conclusion that the rna molecules quantified in this study were not degraded and were suitable for subsequent correlation studies . a reasonable approach to identify these elements was to perform a parametric test assuming a normal distribution of the mrna level populations . however there are ample gene expression studies reported in the literature where the variability in rna content is attributed exclusively to biological variability . if the original distribution of rna had been the unique contributor of variability the samples would have clustered into two groups only .", " during

misincorporation of an adenine instead of cytosine causing g ct a transversion mutation . 8oxodg has also been implicated in an event called transcriptional mutagenesis tm whereby a misincorporated adenine in the transcribing mrna leads to the generation of mutated species of protein figure 1 . as discussed previously accumulation of ros induced dna damage like oxidation of bases and single strand breaks have been implicated in the etiology of ad pd als and other neurological disorders . although the exact causes for this selective vulnerability is yet to be elucidated da metabolism itself has been considered as a major culprit for selective degeneration . in fact under in vitro conditions allowing tm event it has been shown that each round of transcription keeps producing a mutant transcript as long as 8oxodg lesion is not repaired . 8oxodg derived tm species may trigger this process leading to the pathogenesis of pd . comprehensive investigation on age dependent changes in syn mrna profiles as well as identification of tm species supported by functional studies on mutant proteins will definitely add a new dimension to the understanding of syn pathology in conjunction with oxidative stress .", " a recent study on balance and pilates demonstrated that pilates can be effective for enhancing both static and dynamic equilibrium capacity in university students in a

account anticipated seasonal circulation . in 6 sputum samples the bacterial pathogen was only detected in sputum and not in the concomitant nasopharyngeal aspirate moraxella catarrhalis n 3 haemophilus influenzae n 4 and sphingomonas paucimobilis n 1 . another study by lahti et al found evidence for a bacterial infection from induced sputum in 79 of cases but only included patients with radiologically confirmed pneumonia . another limitation of our study is that we can not rule out the possibility that occasionally the induced sputum did not reflect the etiology of the alrti because we did not compare the induced sputum cultures with material retrieved directly from the lungs by bronchoalveolar lavage or thoracocentesis which would obviously have been unethical to perform in

dsas4 elongated reasonably well in vitro consistent with the previous observation of immobile but well elongated sperms in testes of the mutants . based on live imaging and local drug treatment data we found that microtubules at the tail tip region with particularly fast turn over rate and active sliding motion are essential for sperm tail elongation . in addition gigantic sperms in drosophilidae appear to have multiple evolutional origins it will be of interest to search for the crucial process that may have permitted the appearance of long sperm by asking which step of sperm elongation

placed within the 3utr sequence of a heterologous gene and are only transcribed . the genes hosting mutant repeats are usually a marker gene such as gfp or dsred . a serious difficulty in identifying the involvement of rna toxicity in polyq diseases is the overlap with the polyq toxicity in models expressing cag repeats from the orf and placing the repeat in the untranslated sequence of a

wntcatenin signaling activation . in this study we sought to further characterise nci8642 activity using biochemical and biophysical approaches and to extend its characterization in relation to lrp6 given the prominent expression in brain of lrp6 and its relevance to the neurodegenerative diseases field . for the functional studies catenin translocation and tcf luc reporter assay wnt3a cm was used at a 1 2 dilution . after 1 hour at 25c dkk1 was injected over immobilized lrp6 for 240 s at the flow rate of 10 l min . after 24 hours culture medium was replaced with 50 l dkk1 cm diluted as appropriate in optimem . after one hour incubation 37c the cells were stimulated by adding 50 l of wnt3a cm 50 of the final volume and supplemented with either dmso or nci8642 at the indicated final

child presented to accident emergency department with complaints of inability to walk or bear weight on his left lower limb after he spontaneously dislocated his patella while running on uneven ground . a decision for open reduction the patella was found to be locked with its articular surface facing laterally and the medial edge of patella locked past the lateral femoral condyle and wedged into the lateral gutter . a small incision was given along the lateral retinaculum the index finger inserted was through it and the wedged medial patellar edge was freed from the lateral femoral condyle and at the same time lifting the patella out of the lateral gutter it was relocated to its anatomical position . hackl et al reported a locked dislocation with bony avulsion of medial structures after fall . hence we would recommend that in the settings of patella being vertically dislocated and locked open reduction would be the management of choice as these types of dislocations are difficult to relocate by closed reduction . open reduction avoids osteochondral damage associated with repeated attempts of closed reduction and allows the surgeon to perform patellar realignment procedures in order to prevent further patellar dislocations in a setting of prior patellar instability .", " as similar with the abnormalities in the dopaminergic neural system in individuals with substance

maritime and tropical diseases . according to nocht 1919 the trypanosomes resistance to drugs was stable and was maintained after many passages while quinine resistance disappeared in plasmodia after prolonged interruption of medication in the same host . apart from the hypothesis that there was a specific form of the disease in the balkans and turkey other theories were also put forward to account for the failure of treatment or prevention using quinine . according to schilling the conditions that neiva nocht werner mhlens and others have presented as being propitious for the development of quinine resistant races are valid . according to leo slater by different routes from those of neiva and other tropical medicine specialists researchers working on new drugs for malaria did their best to reconstitute the complex connections between parasite host and vector in the laboratory . according to neiva one of the factors that exacerbated malaria amongst these population groups was the incorrect use of quinine which was sold mainly in the form of a sulphate that was effective neither for prevention nor for treatment . a publication from the following year shows that he saw resistance differently from neiva and rodenwaldt which suggests that the latters hypotheses had not left the theoretical realm my personal views on the matter have always been that the apparent resistance to medicine was less a characteristic of the parasite itself or even of certain strains of parasites than of the infected individual in whom it represented a lowering of the protective powers of the organism .", " a medline database search january 1966 to april 2009 was undertaken using key words epithelial ovarian cancer debulking surgery and interval debulking surgery resulting in

been used widely for improving knee pain in oa.89 in our previous studies we demonstrated that glucosamine containing supplements gcq or gcqid glucosamine hydrochloride chondroitin sulfate type ii collagen peptides quercetin glycosides imidazole peptides proteoglycan and vitamin d were effective for relieving knee pain andor locomotor functions in randomized placebo controlled trials.1011 the effects of thermal and exercise therapies on locomotor functions and their mechanism in patients with knee oa have been elucidated with biomechanical methods12 but the biomechanical mechanism of the effects of supplements such as gcqid on locomotor functions has not been reported . exclusion criteria were the same as in our previous study11 and typical reasons for exclusion were the following fast walking speed 1.6 m s presence of hyperuricemia diabetes cardiovascular disease hepatic disease renal disease or heart disease presence of rheumatoid arthritis that may cause joint pain surgical treatment of knee joints needed or undergone daily use of a cane daily or occasional vigorous exercise need for pharmacological articular treatments during the study period a history of osseous or articular diseases other than oa within the past 3 months routine use of health food or medicine that may affect the outcome of the study and presence of any medical condition as judged by the medical investigator . for the biomechanical mechanism of efficacy for locomotor functions motion capture analysis in a normal walking state was conducted to obtain data on gait parameters . changes in measurements during the intervention were compared with baseline using the steel test for jkom total score glfs5 score and questionnaires dunnett s test was used for the vas score for jkom knee pain normal walking speed and parameters measured by motion capture analysis . correlation analysis between changes in parameters analyzed by the motion capture system and locomotor functions that involve the knee joint over the 16week intervention period was conducted and pearson s correlation coefficient r value for parametric variables and spearman s rank correlation coefficient value for nonparametric variables were calculated . angle of soles at the end of the stance phase significantly increased at week 8 and at week 16 compared with the baseline p0.05 p0.01 and angle of toe at the beginning of the stance phase significantly increased at week 16 compared with the baseline p0.01 . as it has been reported that walking speed is mainly controlled by stride length and cadence16 gcqid s effect of increasing normal walking speed was likely attributable to increased stride length .", " after reviewing the relevant literature and extant guidelines a brief questionnaire was constructed

commodities as well as the use of various feed additives which can protect against the toxic effects of ota etc . as a result the bioavailability of ota and probably the toxicity to ruminants is decreased . however the supplementation of ota contaminated diet with activated charcoal was considered as an impractical method of reducing ota toxicity in chicks or pigs that were continuously consuming ota . in addition the toxicological investigations in the same experiments revealed that the contamination levels of ota in kidneys are lower in chicks treated with artichoke or rosallsat in addition to ota than in chicks only treated with the same feed level of ota . a slow excretion of ota suggests a tendency to an increase of toxin levels in the serum as well as assumes a very constant rate of ota in human blood for a long period of time even after repeated exposure to very low concentrations . it can be supposed that only the free ota in the macroorganism has a toxic effect on the tissues as well that continuous persistence of ota in human blood and its slow excretion via kidneys may be influenced on the slow progression of ben . a method is also presented for calculating the

constants for pseudoplastic liquids the viscosity should decrease nearly linearly with shear rate on the log log plot and the value of n is less than one . at high concentration the rheological behavior of panbmimcl solutions acts like that of liquid crystalline polymers lcp . besides it could be found in figure 3 that when at high shear rate the viscosity of high concentration solutions is lower than that of low concentration for example the viscosity of 22wt solution is the lowest among all the solutions when the shear rate is close to 1000 1s . the value of the energy of activation depends strongly on whether the viscosities at various temperatures are evaluated at constant shear stress or at constant shear rate . here since low molecular weight polymers has fewer entanglements than high molecular weight ones it is not surprising that deviations from newtonian behavior start at higher shear rates for the low molecular weight solutions . 7 shows that the complex viscosity

", " it is known that the brain adaptively recalibrates itself to small ( 100  ms ) auditory  visual ( av ) temporal asynchronies so as to maintain intersensory temporal coherence . \n here we explored whether spatial disparity between a sound and light affects av temporal recalibration . \n participants were exposed to a train of asynchronous av stimulus pairs ( sound - first or light - first ) with sounds and lights emanating from either the same or a different location . following a short exposure phase , \n participants were tested on an av temporal order judgement ( toj ) task . \n temporal recalibration manifested itself as a shift of subjective simultaneity in the direction of the adapted audiovisual lag . \n the shift was equally big when exposure and test stimuli were presented from the same or different locations . \n these results provide strong evidence for the idea that spatial co - localisation is not a necessary constraint for intersensory pairing to occur . ", " nucleosomes , a basic structural unit of eukaryotic chromatin , play a significant role in regulating gene expression . \n we have developed a web tool based on dna sequences known from empirical and theoretical studies to influence dna bending and flexibility , and to exclude nucleosomes . \n nxsensor ( available at ) finds nucleosome exclusion sequences , evaluates their length and spacing , and computes an  \n accessibility score giving the proportion of base pairs likely to be nucleosome - free . \n application of nxsensor to the promoter regions of housekeeping ( hk ) genes and those of tissue - specific ( ts ) genes revealed a significant difference between the two classes of gene , the former being significantly more open , on average , particularly near transcription start sites ( tsss ) . \n nxsensor should be a useful tool in assessing the likelihood of nucleosome formation in regions involved in gene regulation and other aspects of chromatin function . ", " mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue ( malt ) lymphomas are characterized by lymphoepithelial lesions pathologically . \n colonic malt lymphomas are relatively rarer than lymphomas of the stomach or small intestine . \n endoscopically , colonic malt lymphoma frequently appears as a nonpedunculated protruding polypoid mass and/or an ulceration in the cecum and/or rectum . \n we report a unique case of a colonic malt lymphoma presenting as a semipedunculated polyp . a 54-year - old man was found to have a 2-cm semipedunculated polyp in the sigmoid colon during screening colonoscopy . \n the polyp was removed by endoscopic mucosal resection . \n histologic examination of the resected polyp revealed diffuse epithelial infiltration by discrete aggregates of lymphoma cells . \n we diagnosed the tumor as low - grade b - cell malt lymphoma by immunohistochemical staining .

", " diclofenac , a nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug , induces apoptosis on the neuroblastoma cell line sh - sy5y through a mitochondrial dysfunction , affecting some antioxidant mechanisms . \n indeed , the time- and dose - dependent increase of apoptosis is associated to an early enhancement of the reactive oxygen species ( ros ) . \n mitochondrial superoxide dismutase ( sod2 ) plays a crucial role in the defence against ros , thus protecting against several apoptotic stimuli . \n diclofenac decreased the protein levels and the enzymatic activity of sod2 , without any significant impairment of the corresponding mrna levels in the sh - sy5y extracts . \n when cells were incubated with an archaeal exogenous thioredoxin , an attenuation of the diclofenac - induced apoptosis was observed , together with an increase of sod2 protein levels . \n furthermore , diclofenac impaired the mitochondrial membrane potential , leading to a release of cytochrome c. these data suggest that mitochondria are involved in the diclofenac - induced apoptosis of sh - sy5y cells and point to a possible role of sod2 in this process . ", " the contamination of seafood by bacteria of fecal origin , especially escherichia coli , is a widely documented sanitary problem . \n the objective of the present study was to isolate e. coli strains from the gills , muscle , and body surface of farmed nile tilapias ( oreochromis niloticus ) fresh - marketed in supermarkets in fortaleza ( cear , brazil ) , to determine their susceptibility to antibiotics of different families ( amikacin , gentamicin , imipenem , cephalothin , cefotaxime , ciprofloxacin , aztreonam , ampicillin , nalidixic acid , tetracycline , and sulfametoxazol - trimetoprim ) , and to determine the nature of resistance by plasmid curing . \n forty - four strains ( body surface = 25 , gills = 15 , muscle = 4 ) were isolated , all of which were susceptible to amikacin , aztreonam , cefotaxime , ciprofloxacin , gentamicin , and imipenem . \n gill and body surface samples yielded 11 isolates resistant to ampicillin , tetracycline , and sulfametoxazol - trimetoprim , 4 of which of plasmidial nature . \n the multiple antibiotic resistance index was higher for strains isolated from body surface than from gills . \n the overall high antibiotic susceptibility of e. coli strains isolated from fresh - marketed tilapia was satisfactory , although the occasional finding of plasmidial resistance points to the need for close microbiological surveillance of the farming , handling , and marketing conditions of aquaculture products .

", " purpose : of this study was to explore the effect of social support on the levels of anxiety and depression of hemodialysis patients.material and methods:258 patients undergoing hemodialysis were enrolled . a questionnaire developed for the purpose of the study \n was used to collect data through the interview process . apart from socio - demographic , clinical and other characteristics \n , the questionnaire also included the multidimensional scale of perceived social support ( mspss ) to assess social support from significant others , family and friends , and the questionnaire hospital anxiety and depression scale ( hads ) to assess the levels of anxiety and depression of patients.results:53,9% of the participants were male while 34,1% of the participants were > 70 years old . 32,9% and 30,2% of the participants felt high levels of anxiety and depression , respectively . \n analysis of data showed a statistically significant association between anxiety / depression and social support from significant others , family and friends ( p=<0,001 for all associations ) . \n in particular , patients with high levels of anxiety and depression felt less support from their significant others , family and friends . \n the multinomial logistic regression , showed a statistically significant effect of social support from friends in anxiety levels ( p=0,004 ) . \n an one point increase of the support from friends seems to reduce by 57% the probability of having high levels of anxiety . in addition , statistically significant effect of social support from significant others , family and friends was observed on the levels of depression ( p=<0,001 , p=0,001 & p=0,003 , respectively ) . \n specifically , an one point increase of the support from significant others , family and friends it was found to reduce by 77% , 71% and 56% respectively the probability of experiencing high levels of depression.conclusions:phyco-social evaluation is essential when providing holistic care to hemodialysis patients . ", " esophageal achalasia is a motility disorder characterized by impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter and dilatation of the distal two - thirds of the esophagus . \n this condition may be a non - frequent reason of extrinsic compression of left atrium . in turn \n , this can be a cause of some hemodynamic changes such as chest discomfort , dyspnea or reduced exercise tolerance , systemic hypotension and tachycardia . \n we describe a case of a patient with esophagus achalasia compressing the left atrium and inducing hemodynamic compromise . \n the diagnostic methods , as chest x - ray , computed tomography ( ct ) , manometry , and 2d - trans - thoracic echocardiography ( tte ) demonstrated the esophagus dilation , the impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter , and its compression on the left atrium . \n three - d trans - thoracic echocardiography ( 3d - tte ) was firstly performed also . \n this last examination pointed out better than 2d - tte the extrinsic compression of the left atrium due to the esophagus dilatation . \n therefore , 3d - tte is a true improvement for the echocardiographic diagnosis of the left atrial compression induced by esophageal achalasia . ", " due primarily to the increasing shortage of allogeneic donor organs , xenotransplantation has become the focus of a growing field of research . \n currently , micropigs are the most suitable donor animal for humans . however , no standard method has been developed to evaluate the systemic vascular anatomy of micropigs and standard reference values to aid in the selection of normal healthy animals as potential organ donors are lacking . using 64-channel multidetector row computed tomographic angiography ( mdcta ) , we evaluated morphological features of the major systemic vessels in micropigs and compared our results to published human data . \n the main vasculature of the animals was similar to that of humans , except for the iliac arterial system . \n however , diameters of the major systemic vessels were significantly different between micropigs and humans . \n specifically , the diameter of the aortic arch , abdominal aorta , external iliac artery , and femoral artery , were measured as 1.50  0.07 cm , 0.85  0.06 cm , 0.52  0.05 cm , and 0.48  0.05 cm , respectively , in the micropigs . \n this mdcta data for micropig major systemic vessels can be used as standard reference values for xenotransplantation studies . \n the use of 64-channel mdcta enables accurate evaluation of the major systemic vasculature in micropigs . ", " amide hydrogen / deuterium exchange ( h / d exchange ) coupled with mass spectrometry has been widely used to analyze the interface of protein - protein interactions , protein conformational changes , protein dynamics and protein - ligand interactions . \n h / d exchange on the backbone amide positions has been utilized to measure the deuteration rates of the micro - regions in a protein by mass spectrometry1,2,3 . \n the resolution of this method depends on pepsin digestion of the deuterated protein of interest into peptides that normally range from 3 - 20 residues . \n although the resolution of h / d exchange measured by mass spectrometry is lower than the single residue resolution measured by the heteronuclear single quantum coherence ( hsqc ) method of nmr , the mass spectrometry measurement in h / d exchange is not restricted by the size of the protein4 . \n h / d exchange is carried out in an aqueous solution which maintains protein conformation . we provide a method that utilizes the maldi - tof for detection2 , instead of a hplc / esi ( electrospray ionization)-ms system5,6 . \n the maldi - tof provides accurate mass intensity data for the peptides of the digested protein , in this case protein kinase pak2 ( also called -pak ) . \n proteolysis of pak 2 is carried out in an offline pepsin digestion . \n this alternative method , when the user does not have access to a hplc and pepsin column connected to mass spectrometry , or when the pepsin column on hplc does not result in an optimal digestion map , for example , the heavily disulfide - bonded secreted phospholipase a2 ( spla2 ) . \n utilizing this method , we successfully monitored changes in the deuteration level during activation of pak2 by caspase 3 cleavage and autophosphorylation7,8,9 . ", " according to a patient - centered viewpoint , the meaning of harmonization in the context of laboratory medicine is that the information should be comparable irrespective of the measurement procedure used and where and/or when a measurement is made . \n harmonization represents a fundamental aspect of quality in laboratory medicine as its ultimate goal is to improve patient outcomes through the provision of an accurate and actionable laboratory information . \n although the initial focus has to a large extent been to harmonize and standardize analytical processes and methods , the scope of harmonization goes beyond to include all other aspects of the total testing process ( ttp ) , such as terminology and units , report formats , reference intervals and decision limits , as well as tests and test profiles request and criteria for interpretation . \n two major progresses have been made in the area of harmonization in laboratory medicine : first , the awareness that harmonization should take into consideration not only the analytical phase but all steps of the ttp , thus dealing with the request , the sample , the measurement , and the report . \n second , as the processes required to achieve harmonization are complicated , a systematic approach is needed . \n the international federation of clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine ( ifcc ) has played a fundamental and successful role in the development of standardized and harmonized assays , and now it should continue to work in the field through the collaboration and cooperation with many other stakeholders . ", " type 2 diabetes is a heterogeneous disorder that develops as a result of relatively inappropriate insulin secretion and insulin resistance . increased levels of free fatty acids ( ffas ) are one of the important factors for the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and contribute to defective -cell proliferation and increased -cell apoptosis . \n recently , glucagon - like peptide-1 ( glp-1 ) receptor agonists have been shown to possess an antiapoptotic effect , by increasing -cell mass and improving -cell function . \n however , their effects on -cells in vitro against lipotoxicity have not been elucidated completely . in this study \n , we investigated whether the glp-1 receptor agonist exendin-4 displays prosurvival effects in pancreatic -cells exposed to chronic elevated ffas . \n results showed that exendin-4 inhibited apoptosis induced by palmitate in min6 cells . \n after 24  h of incubation , exendin-4 caused rapid activation of extracellular signal - related kinase 1/2 ( erk1/2 ) under lipotoxic conditions . \n the erk1/2 inhibitor pd98059 blocked the antilipotoxic effect of exendin-4 on min6 cells . \n exendin-4 also inhibited the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis . \n this inhibition is associated with upregulation of bcl-2 . \n our findings suggested that exendin-4 may exert cytoprotective effects through activation of erk1/2 and inhibition of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway . ", " ribonucleic acids ( rna ) are hypothesized to have preceded their derivatives , deoxyribonucleic acids ( dna ) , as the molecular media of genetic information when life emerged on earth . \n molecular biologists are accustomed to the dramatic effects a subtle variation in the ribose moiety composition between rna and dna can have on the stability of these molecules . while dna is very stable after extraction from biological samples and subsequent treatment , rna is notoriously labile . the short half - life property , inherent to rna , benefits cells that do not need to express their entire repertoire of proteins . \n the cellular machinery turns off the production of a given protein by shutting down the transcription of its cognate coding gene and by either actively degrading the remaining mrna or allowing it to decay on its own . \n the steady - state level of each mrna in a given cell varies continuously and is specified by changing kinetics of synthesis and degradation . because it is technically possible to simultaneously measure thousands of nucleic acid molecules , \n these quantities have been studied by the life sciences community to investigate a range of biological problems . \n since the rna abundance can change according to a wide range of perturbations , this makes it the molecule of choice for exploring biological systems ; its instability , on the other hand , could be an underestimated source of technical variability . we found that a large fraction of the rna abundance originally present in the biological system prior to extraction was masked by the rna labeling and measurement procedure . \n the method used to extract rna molecules from cells and to label them prior to hybridization operations on dna arrays affects the original distribution of rna . \n only if rna measurements are performed according to the same procedure can biological information be inferred from the assay read out .
