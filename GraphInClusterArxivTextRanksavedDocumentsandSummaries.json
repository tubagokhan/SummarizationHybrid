collinear shg configuration discussed elsewhere @xcite to perform spectroscopic shg measurements on square arrays of 1  @xmath1m - tall 4h - sic and 6h - sic pillars with the main axis of the arrays in the _ xz _ plane of incidence . \n the fundamental radiation incident at 28 and 62 degrees with respect to the normal to the sample surface was focused onto the sample with a peak fluence on the order of 10 mj/@xmath2 . \n both 4h and 6h - sic samples were c - cut so that the _ c_-axis of the crystals was parallel to the surface normal . \n typical shg and linear reflectivity spectra collected using the fel radiation for the two incident polarisations are presented in fig .  \n [ general],b - e . \n there , the respective spectra of the bare substrate are shown for comparison . \n for _ p_-polarised fundamental radiation ( fig .  \n [ general],d ) , the shg response features two pronounced peaks located at the zone - center frequencies of transverse and longitudinal optical phonons in sic @xcite , around 797 @xmath3 and 965 @xmath3 , respectively . the corresponding shg spectrum from the nanopillars demonstrate a much stronger shg signal at around 900 @xmath3 . due to the absence of this peak in the shg spectrum \n when the fundamental radiation is _ \n s_-polarised , we attribute this shg feature to the excitation of the monopole sphp mode in the nanopillars @xcite .    in general , \n the outgoing shg field @xmath4 is related to the incident electromagnetic fields @xmath5 via the so - called local field factors @xmath6 :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the nonlinear polarisation and @xmath9 is the nonlinear susceptibility tensor . \n the excitation of the sphp monopole mode leads to strong localization of the _ z_-projection of the fundamental electric field @xmath10 ( normal to the surface plane ) and thus a resonant enhancement of @xmath11 . \n the latter results in a pronounced increase of the shg output when the fundamental radiation is _ p_-polarised . \n however , the sphp dipole modes observed in the range of 920960  @xmath3 rely on the resonant enhancement of the in - plane electric fields described by the local field factors @xmath12 and thus can be excited with both _ \n p_- and _ s_-polarised fundamental radiation . \n the total shg response is given by a vector sum of the terms on the right hand side of eq .  \n ( 1 ) originating from various tensor components of the nonlinear susceptibility @xmath13 . \n as the strength of @xmath14 is the largest in this spectral range @xcite , the sphp monopole mode , with an enhancement of @xmath11 , naturally results in a higher shg output than the dipole modes .    \n the results of the systematic studies of the shg response of various arrays of nanopillars are summarized in fig .  \n [ shifts ] for the 4h - sic ( a , c ) and 6h - sic ( b , d ) samples . \n the panels ( a - b ) illustrate the evolution of the shg spectra upon varying pillar diameter @xmath15 . \n it is seen that upon decreasing @xmath15 , the sphp monopole - driven shg peak exhibits a clear redshift . \n remarkably , while the sphp monopole mode shifts in the range of about 890 - 910 @xmath3 , the shg enhancement factor associated with the excitation of the sphp monopole mode varies strongly with @xmath15 . \n the panels ( c - d ) offer a zoom - in into the evolution of the sphp monopole mode - driven shg for a large variety of nanopillar arrays , indicating that the variations of the shg enhancement are observed for both 4h and 6h samples . \n the dependences of the sphp monopole - driven shg output on the spectral position of the sphp monopole mode for the two sic polytypes are shown in fig .  \n [ analysis],a with open symbols .     \n = 1200 , 1100 and 1000 nm , respectively . \n , scaledwidth=47.0% ]        the strong dispersion in the sic reststrahlen band suggests that the observed spectral dependence of the shg enhancement could be captured in numerical simulations . \n we calculated shg response using both linear and nonlinear sic dispersion@xcite , the results of the simulation of the linear optical response@xcite , and nonlinear polarization @xmath16 from eq .  \n ( 1 ) spatially integrated over the sic volume , with the following non - zero components of the nonlinear susceptibility : @xmath14 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 . \n the resultant shg spectra simulated with comsol multiphysics software ( www.comsol.com ) are shown in fig .  \n [ analysis],b with full symbols . \n it is seen that the steep experimental dependence can not be quantitatively described within the simple model used in the calculations , which yields only a moderate increase of the shg output when the sphp monopole mode frequency is decreased .    \n we note the work of carpetti _ \n et al_. @xcite where the authors thoroughly examined plasmon - induced shg enhancement from arrays of au nanoparticles as a function of the inter - particle distance @xmath19 . in the regime of @xmath20 ( as it is in our case ) , the dependence of the shg output on @xmath19 was explained in terms of the changing filling factor ( and thus the associated number of active nanoemitters ) . \n for very small inter - particle gaps ( @xmath21 ) , a modulation of the shg output has been attributed to the modification of the electromagnetic field localization in the gaps @xcite . \n further , a large mismatch between the spatial period of the nanopillars @xmath22 and the resonant light wavelength @xmath23 rules out the excitation of propagating surface polaritons @xcite which are known to enhance the shg output @xcite . \n since all these effects are included in our simulations , we conclude that the origin of the observed shg enhancement is unrelated to the periodicity of the array .    \n an alternative scenario for the observed trend could invoke modifications of the non - local shg contribution enhanced by a regular array structure . \n the importance of the non - local shg was already demonstrated in a number of subwavelength - separated plasmonic nanoobjects @xcite . \n the amplitude and phase of this non - local shg source depends on the electric field distribution , i.e. on both the pillar size @xmath15 and the periodicity @xmath24 . \n as such , the interference conditions between the shg sources vary for different samples , thus resulting in a strong modification of the shg output .    \n further , the apparent difference in the shape of the resonant shg output for the 4h and 6h samples ( see fig .  [ shifts ] ) is related to the anisotropic nature of sic . \n the hexagonal sic polytypes are known to exhibit zone - folded weak modes in the reststrahlen region @xcite originating from particular stacking of the atomic layers along the _ \n c_-axis of the crystal @xcite . \n these weakly ir - active zone - folded modes can be visualised in the reflectivity measurements at oblique incidence @xcite . \n although zone - folded modes exist in both 4h and 6h polytypes , different stacking of the sic atomic layers is responsible for them having different frequencies , as illustrated in fig .  \n [ analysis],c - d . \n the additional periodicity in the crystal results in folding of the large brillouin zone thus modifying the phonon dispersion and making the excitation of phonons with non - zero wavevectors ( @xmath25 ) possible . \n it is seen in fig .  \n [ analysis],d that the zone - folded mode in the 6h - sic polytype with the reduced wavevector @xmath26 @xmath27 can be excited in the range of @xmath28  @xmath3 which is close to the typical monopole sphp resonant frequency of the sic nanopillars discussed above . \n in particular , the interaction of the sphp and zone - folded mode which shifted the apparent spectral positions of the monopole sphp eigenmode in the linear response @xcite , is seen responsible for the complex structure of the resonant shg output in our experiments ( fig .  \n [ shifts],d ) . \n the weak ir activity of the zone - folded modes is related to the large negative dielectric permittivity of sic in the reststrahlen band . as such , the out - of - plane component of the electromagnetic field @xmath10 remains small which inhibits the coupling of incident light to the zone - folded phonon mode . \n however , the excitation of the sphp monopole mode in the nanopillars drives a strong increase of @xmath10 , which facilitates the sphp monopole interaction with the zone - folded phonon ( fig .  \n [ analysis],c ) .    \n figure  [ analysis],a illustrates the effect of the zone - folded mode on the observed shg output . \n the open red squares ( 4h ) and blue circles ( 6h ) depict the shg intensity obtained at the sphp monopole ( resonant ) frequencies , and the dashed lines illustrate a clear correlation between the maximum shg output and the spectral position of the sphp monopole peak . \n similar trends are observed for the 4h and 6h - sic samples as long as the sphp monopole and the zone - folded mode are well - separated . \n when these two resonances start to overlap , an additional enhancement of the shg output produced at the sphp monopole resonance in 6h - sic samples is observed . \n moreover , the dependence of the shg signal at the frequency of the zone - folded mode @xmath29  @xmath3 ( green triangles ) exhibits a much faster increase when the two resonances are brought together ( dotted line ) , indicating an efficient interplay between the sphp monopole and the zone - folded mode .    \n we note that the interaction of the localized sphp eigenmodes and the intrinsic excitations of the medium is a unique fingerprint of mid - ir nanophononics . indeed \n , surface plasmon excitations in metals rely on the free electron gas , which is essentially isotropic . as such , the shg output of plasmonic nanostructures is ( i ) largely determined by the metal of choice , usually au , ( ii ) exhibits only weak spectral dependence @xcite and ( iii ) is limited by robust phase relations in the likely case of multiple shg sources @xcite . on the contrary , the flexibility of the sphps is provided by the coupling of the surface phonon polariton excitations to the intrinsic bulk phonon modes . the latter can be engineered by designing artificial metamaterials based on hybrid multilayer structures @xcite , thus allowing for an effective control of their optical properties . to summarize , \n we have observed shg output enhancement associated with the excitation of the sphp eigenmodes in an array of nanopillars grown from sic of different polytypes . \n the strongest shg output is associated with the excitation of the monopole sphp mode characterized by strong localization of the normal to surface projection of the electric field @xmath10 . \n the spectral positions of the shg peaks shift according to the geometric parameters of the nanophononic structures . \n we found a strong dependence of the magnitude of the shg enhancement on the resonant frequency . \n this experimentally observed dependence can not be quantitatively described by simply taking into account the sub - diffractional field localization and the dispersion of the linear and nonlinear optical properties of sic . \n further , we discuss the interplay of the sphps and the intrinsic crystalline anisotropy for an efficient nonlinear - optical conversion . this mechanism is supported by the shg spectral measurements on the 6h - sic nanopillars where excitation of the sphp monopole mode interacting with the weak zone - folded phonon resulted in an additional enhancement of the shg output . \n the presence of intrinsic resonances strongly alters the phase relations in their vicinity , providing a natural way for optimizing the shg response in a relatively narrow spectral range . \n our findings demonstrate high potential of mid - ir nonlinear nanophononics as a novel and promising platform for nonlinear optics and illustrate the rich opportunities it provides for efficient control over nonlinear - optical response .    \n the authors thank g.  kichin and a.  kirilyuk ( radboud university nijmegen ) for stimulating discussions . \n s.a.m . acknowledges the office of naval research , the royal society , and the lee -

ibs are characterized by similar nearest neighbour and next - nearest neighbour hopping integrals , the parent compounds of the most studied families of ibs ( e.g. bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 and

phenomenology in the normal as well as in the superconducting state.@xcite moreover , even if signs have been reported @xcite , the evidence for a charge order in the phase diagram of ibs still remains elusive .    \n nominally , half band filling can be approached in bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 ibs by replacing ba with an alkali atom a = k , rb or cs , resulting in 5.5 electrons per fe atom.@xcite

given band localize the electrons of other bands remain delocalized , leading to a metallic behaviour and eventually to superconductivity . \n this orbital selective behaviour should give rise to markedly @xmath12-dependent response functions @xcite and to a sort of @xmath12-space phase separation of metallic and insulating - like domains . \n the point is , what happens in the real space ? \n will one probe the sum of the insulating and metallic response functions or should one detect a real space phase separation@xcite also in afe@xmath3as@xmath3 ibs @xcite , with different local

quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) are quite powerful tools which allow to probe the local response function and charge distribution . moreover , in nqr experiments @xcite the magnetic field , which often acts as a relevant perturbation , is zero . here \n we show , by combining @xmath0as and @xmath13rb nqr and @xmath1rb nmr measurements , that in

approaching localization while others probe dynamics possibly associated with a metallic phase with a pseudogap.@xcite upon further decreasing the temperature the volume fraction of the heavy electron phase vanishes while the one of the metallic phase , which eventually becomes superconducting below @xmath15 k , grows . \n thus , we present a neat evidence for a charge order in rbfe@xmath3as@xmath3 akin to underdoped cuprates . \n the charge order favours a phase separation into metallic and nearly insulating regions , which could result from the theoretically predicted orbital selective behaviour.@xcite    nqr and nmr measurements were performed on a rbfe@xmath3as@xmath3 polycrystalline sample with a mass of about 400 mg , sealed in a quartz tube under a 0.2 bar ar atmosphere in

further details on the sample preparation and characterization are given in the supplemental material.@xcite    first of all we shall discuss the appearance of a charge order in the feas planes of rbfe@xmath3as@xmath3 , as detected by @xmath0as nqr spectra . for a nuclear spin @xmath16 , as it is the case of @xmath0as and @xmath1rb , the nqr spectrum is characterized by a single line at a frequency@xcite @xmath17 with @xmath18 the nuclear quadrupole moment , @xmath19 the main component of the electric field gradient ( efg ) tensor and @xmath20 its asymmetry @xmath21 . \n hence the nqr spectrum probes the efg at the nuclei generated by the surrounding charge distribution . above 140 k , @xmath0as nqr spectrum ( fig.[figspec ] ) is centered around 14.6 mhz , with a linewidth of about 170 khz , while @xmath1rb nqr spectrum is centered around 6.2 mhz with a width of about 20 khz . \n the relatively narrow nqr spectra confirms the good quality of our sample . \n we performed density functional theory ( dft ) calculations using elk code in the generalized gradient approximation@xcite in order to derive _ ab initio _ the electric field gradient and nqr frequency . for @xmath0as and @xmath1rb \n we obtained @xmath22 mhz and @xmath23 mhz , respectively , in reasonable agreement with the experimental values in spite of the significant electronic correlations.@xcite this shows that dft is still able to provide a fair description of the system as far as it remains a normal metal .    upon cooling the sample below @xmath4 \n k significant changes are detected in @xmath0as nqr spectra ( fig . \n [ figspec ] ) . \n the spectrum is observed to progressively broaden with decreasing temperature and below 50 k one clearly observes that the spectrum is actually formed by two humps nearly symmetrically shifted with respect to the center ( fig.[figspec]a ) . \n the presence of two peaks in the @xmath0as nqr spectra has already been detected in different families of ibs and associated with a nanoscopic phase separation in regions characterized by different electron doping levels.@xcite however , at variance with what we observe here , the two peaks observed in other ibs do not show the same intensity @xcite and the spectra show little temperature dependence , namely the nanoscopic phase separation is likely pinned . under both high magnetic field and high pressure \n an asymmetric splitting of @xmath0as nmr spectrum was detected also in kfe@xmath3as@xmath3 which , however , is absent in zero field ( nqr).@xcite here we observe the emergence of an nqr spectrum which recalls the one expected for an incommensurate cdw,@xcite which causes a periodic modulation of the efg at the nuclei and gives rise to two symmetrically shifted peaks in the spectrum . \n the efg modulation could involve also the onset of an orbital order@xcite or a structural distortion , possibly coupled to the charge order . \n although it is not straightforward from our data to discriminate among these scenarios , it is clear that we detect a symmetry breaking below @xmath5 to a low temperature phase characterized by a spatial modulation of the efg , namely by a charge order .    \n @xmath1rb nqr spectrum does not show a significant broadening upon decreasing the temperature but is characterized by a @xmath24 which , at @xmath25 k , shows a temperature dependence similar to that of the @xmath0as nqr spectra full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , proportional to the charge order parameter ( fig.[figspec]c ) . below \n @xmath7 @xmath1rb @xmath24 flattens and deviates from @xmath0as nqr fwhm . \n the fact that the nqr spectrum of the out of plane @xmath1rb nuclei is less sensitive than @xmath0as one to the charge order is an indication that the order develops in the feas planes and that the modulation of the efg at @xmath0as nuclei should occur over a few lattice steps , otherwise one should expect a splitting also of the narrow @xmath1rb nqr spectrum . \n it is interesting to notice that at a temperature of the order of @xmath7 an abrupt change in the uniaxial thermal expansion occurs,@xcite evidencing also a change in the lattice properties .    \n now we discuss the temperature dependence of the low - energy dynamics probed by @xmath0as and @xmath1rb @xmath14 . \n the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate was determined from the recovery of the nuclear magnetization after exciting the nuclear spins with a saturation recovery pulse sequence . \n the recovery of @xmath0as magnetization in nqr is shown in fig.[figrec]a . \n one notices that a single exponential recovery describes very well the recovery of the nuclear magnetization at @xmath26 k , as it can be expected for a homogeneous system where all nuclei probe the same dynamics \n . however , below @xmath6 k one observes the appearance of a second component characterized by much longer relaxation times . \n namely , a part of the nuclei probes dynamics causing a fast relaxation ( @xmath27 ) and a part of the nuclei a slow relaxation ( @xmath28 ) . \n accordingly , the recovery was fit to @xmath29 \\,\\,\\ \n , , \\ ] ] with @xmath30 the nuclear magnetization at thermal equilibrium , @xmath31 and @xmath32 the fraction of fast relaxing and slow relaxing nuclei , respectively , @xmath33 a factor accounting for a non perfect saturation by the radiofrequency pulses and @xmath34 a stretching exponent characterizing the slowly relaxing component . as the temperature is lowered \n one observes a progressive increase of @xmath32 with respect to @xmath31 and at the lowest temperature ( @xmath35 k ) , about 80% of the nuclei are characterized by the slow relaxation ( fig.[figrec]c ) . \n it is important to notice that in rbfe@xmath3as@xmath3 wu et al.@xcite ( in nmr , not in nqr ) did not observe a clear separation of the recovery in two components as we do here but they did observe deviations from a single exponential recovery below 20 k which , however , were fitted with a stretched exponential , likely yielding an average @xmath14 value between @xmath28 and @xmath27 . \n remarkably also @xmath1rb nmr @xmath14 clearly shows two components below 25 k and just one above.@xcite    @xmath0as @xmath14 was measured both on the high frequency and on the low - frequency shoulder of the nqr spectrum and it was found to be the same ( fig.[figt1]a ) over a broad temperature range . \n moreover , at @xmath36 k we carefully checked the frequency dependence of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 and found that neither the two relaxation rates nor their amplitude vary across the spectrum ( fig.[figrec]b , see also ref . ) . \n this means that nuclei resonating at different frequencies probe the same dynamics which implies that the charge modulation induced by the charge order has a nanoscopic periodicity.@xcite one could argue that the two components are actually present at all temperatures but that they arise only at low temperature once nuclear spin diffusion@xcite is no longer able to establish a common spin temperature ( i.e. a common @xmath39 ) among the nuclei resonating at different frequencies . \n however , we remark that since the nuclear spin - spin relaxation rate ( @xmath40 ) is constant @xcite and the width of the nqr spectrum is nearly constant below 40 k ( fig.[figspec]c ) the poor efficiency of nuclear spin diffusion should not vary , at least for @xmath41 k. hence , the appearance of different relaxation rates below @xmath7 should arise from a phase separation causing a slight change in the average electronic charge distribution causing little effect on the nqr spectra ( see fig . \n [ figspec ] ) but a marked differentiation in the low - energy excitations @xcite , which starts to be significant at low temperature \n once the effect of electronic correlations is relevant .    \n one has to clarify if the relaxation mechanism is magnetic , driven by electron spin fluctuations , or quadrupolar , driven by efg fluctuations , typically induced by cdw amplitude and phase modes.@xcite in order to clarify this point we measured the ratio between @xmath1rb and @xmath2rb @xmath14 ( fast component ) at a few selected temperatures below 25 k. the ratio @xmath42 , in good agreement with the ratio between the square of the gyromagnetic ratios of the two nuclei @xmath43 , showing that the relaxation is driven by the correlated spin fluctuations and not by charge fluctuations associated with cdw excitations . since @xmath0as shows a temperature dependence of the relaxation analogous to the one of @xmath1rb ( fig.[figt1]a ) we argue that also @xmath0as @xmath14 is driven by spin fluctuations . \n thus we can write that @xmath44 the form factor giving the hyperfine coupling with the collective spin excitations at wave - vector @xmath45 , and @xmath46 the imaginary part of the dynamic susceptibility at the resonance frequency @xmath47 .    \n now we turn to the temperature dependence of @xmath14 above @xmath6 k and of @xmath28 and @xmath27 below that temperature . above \n @xmath7 @xmath14 increases with a power law @xmath48 , with @xmath49 for @xmath0as , and flattens around @xmath4 k ( fig.[figt1]a ) , in very good agreement with the results reported by wu et al.@xcite from @xmath0as nmr . \n notice that @xmath5 corresponds to the temperature below which we start to observe a significant broadening of @xmath0as nqr spectrum . \n hence , the power law behaviour of @xmath14 seems to arise from the onset of the charge order .    \n below @xmath6 k @xmath27 deviates from the power law behaviour and progressively flattens on decreasing temperature ( fig.[figt1]a ) . \n the same behaviour is detected for @xmath1rb nmr @xmath14 , although the flattening starts at a higher temperature , suggesting that @xmath7 might be field dependent . \n on the other hand , @xmath28 gets progressively longer as the temperature is lowered and follows an activated trend with an energy barrier @xmath50 k.    the behaviour of @xmath27 is characteristic of a system approaching a qcp where localization occurs . in fact , from moriya self - consistent renormalization ( scr ) approach for a quasi-2d system with af correlations , one should have @xmath51,@xcite with @xmath52 the static susceptibility at the af wave - vector . in the proximity of the qcp @xmath53 , \n leading to a weak logarithmic divergence of @xmath54 for @xmath55 , while at higher temperature @xmath52 should show a curie - weiss behaviour , yielding a nearly flat @xmath14 , as we do observe in rbfe@xmath3as@xmath3 ( fig.[figt1]a ) . \n the corresponding behaviour of @xmath56 is reported in fig.[figt1]b .    on the other hand , @xmath57 , corresponding to the relaxation rate of the majority phase at low temperature , shows the opposite trend ( fig.[figt1]b ) , decreasing upon cooling . \n being the system metallic at low temperature , the deviation of @xmath57 from the constant korringa - like behaviour @xcite expected for a metal should possibly be associated with the opening of a pseudogap , similarly to what one observes in the underdoped regime of the cuprates,@xcite and in agreement with theoretical predictions for hole - doped ibs.@xcite    in conclusion , our results show that , akin to cuprates , a charge order develops also in the normal state of ibs when the electronic correlations are sizeable . \n accordingly , the presence of a charge order appears to be a common feature in the phase diagram of cuprate and iron - based superconductors and could play a key role in determining the superconducting state properties.@xcite moreover , we observe a local electronic separation in two phases characterized by different excitations which could possibly be explained in terms of the orbital selective behaviour@xcite predicted for ibs . \n finally we remark that the occurrence of an electronic phase separation is theoretically supported by a recent study of the electron fluid compressibility .
