{"all_summary": ["In reviewing DOD federal civilian deployment records and other electronic documentation at selected component locations we found that these components lacked documentation to show that they had fully complied with DODs force health protection and surveillance policy requirements for some federal civilian personnel who deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq. As reflected in table 2 based on the deployment records maintained by the components at locations included in our review the overall number of federal civilian deployment records lacking documentation of only one of the required immunizations for deployment to Afghanistan and Iraq was 285 out of 3771. With increases in the departments use of federal civilian personnel to support military operations DOD officials have recognized the need for more complete and centralized locationspecific deployment information and deploymentrelated health information on its deployed federal civilians. Although DOD federal civilian and military personnel generally receive various special pays to compensate them for conditions of deployment in certain scenarios that we modeled the overall amounts of compensation payments were higher for DOD federal civilian personnel than for military personnel as illustrated in tables 6 and 7. Both DOD federal civilian and military personnel who are injured in the line of duty are eligible to receive continuation of their pay during the initial period of treatment and may be eligible to receive recurring payments for lost wages. In addition to disability compensation both DOD federal civilian and military personnel have access to disability retirement benefits for permanent total disabilities. However the benefit amounts generally differ for each group. In addition to lump sum and recurring benefits survivors of deceased DOD federal civilians and military personnel receive noncash benefits. The department acknowledged the necessity for all deployed civilians to receive required medical assessments and immunizations and that documentation must be available in every instance. In the absence of more specific details on its planned actions we continue to emphasize the departments need for a comprehensive oversight and quality assurance mechanism without which it will not be effectively positioned to ensure compliance with its policies or ensure the health care and protection of its deployed federal civilians as they continue to support contingency operations. Moreover as we noted in our report to provide assurances that the results of our review of hard copy deployment records at the selected component locations were accurate we requested that each components designated medical personnel reexamine those deployment records that we determined were missing required health documentation. As we noted in our report we did not make direct analytical comparisons between compensation and benefits offered by DOD to deployed federal civilian and military personnel because such comparisons must account for the demands of the military service such as involuntary relocation frequent and lengthy separations from family and liability for combat. Specifically we reviewed hard copies of deployment records for 454 out of a reported 822 federal civilian personnel at seven component locations and automated deployment records for 2977 out of the reported 2977 federal civilian personnel at the other location where all deployment records were being maintained electronically. To determine the extent to which DOD has established and the components have implemented medical treatment policies for DOD federal civilians who deployed in support of contingency operations we examined pertinent medical treatment policies for DOD federal civilian employees who required treatment for injuries and diseases sustained while supporting contingency operations. For military personnel we also deducted the amount of pay not subject to taxes due to the combat zone exclusion family separation allowance basic allowance for subsistence and basic allowance for housing. Using these assumptions we generated an adjusted gross income and used that as input into a commercial tax program Turbo Tax to obtain federal taxes owed. As table 14 shows DOD federal civilian personnel with permanent partial disabilities receive payments based on salary and dependents while military personnel receive payments based on the severity of the injury and their number of dependents as long as the condition persists.", "Our current system for taxing business income causes economic inefficiency because it imposes significantly different effective rates of tax on different types of investments. As a result resources have been shifted away from higherreturn business investment into owneroccupied housing and within the business sector resources have been shifted from higherreturn corporations to noncorporate businesses. Furthermore the complexity of and frequent revisions to the tax system make it more difficult and costly for taxpayers who want to comply to do so and for IRS to explain and enforce tax laws. Both income and consumption taxes can be levied on individuals or businesses or on a combination of the two. Under a pure worldwide system all of the income that a U.S. corporation earns abroad would be taxed at the same effective rate that a corporation earning the same amount of income domestically would pay. On the other hand a pure territorial system may be less complex for IRS to administer and for taxpayers to comply with than the current tax system because there would be no need for the antideferral rules or the foreign tax credit which are among the most complex features of the current system. Our publication Understanding the Tax Reform Debate Background Criteria and Questions may be useful in guiding policymakers as they consider tax reform proposals. To the extent tax expenditures are retained consideration should be given to whether they could be better targeted to meet an identified need. Tax changes that increase efficiency can also increase the longterm rate of economic growth if they increase the rate of technological change however not all efficiencyincreasing tax changes will do so.

In 1994 Congress required that CMS conduct a survey of ASC costs no later than January 1 1995 and thereafter every 5 years to revise ASC payment rates. To determine the OPPS payment rates CMS first calculates each hospitals cost for each service by multiplying the charge for that service by a costtocharge ratio computed from the hospitals most recently reported data. When radiology services were billed with procedures in the ASC setting these services generally were performed and billed by another part B provider. However in the hospital outpatient setting some additional services were included on the hospitals bills. As ASCs generally receive payment from Medicare only for procedures they typically include only those procedures on their bills. In the case of the laboratory services billed with procedures in the ASC and hospital outpatient department settings those services were not costs included in the payment for the procedure in either setting and were paid separately in each case. In the case of the hospital outpatient department setting the payment was generally made to the hospital while for procedures performed at ASCs payment was made to another provider who performed the service. Although costs for individual procedures vary in general the median costs for procedures are lower in ASCs relative to the median costs of their APC groups than the median costs for the same procedures in the hospital outpatient department setting. The APC groups in the OPPS reflect the relative costs of procedures performed in ASCs in the same way that they reflect the relative costs of the same procedures when they are performed in hospital outpatient departments. In 1990 when CMS revised the payment system based on a 1986 ASC survey CMS found ASCs average laborrelated share of costs to be 34.45 percent and used this percentage as the laborrelated portion of the payment rate. We created a similar list of additional services for each of the top 20 procedures when they were performed in hospital outpatient departments. To compare the Medicare payments for procedures performed in ASCs and hospital outpatient departments we identified whether any additional services included in our analysis resulted in an additional payment. Because there were no recent existing data on ASC costs we surveyed 600 ASCs randomly selected from all ASCs to obtain their 2004 cost and procedure data. We summed the costs of the resources for each procedure and created a relative weight scale by dividing the total cost of each procedure by the average cost across all of the procedures. We compared electronic CMS data with the original document sources for a large sample of records performed electronic testing for errors in accuracy and completeness and reviewed data for reasonableness. For each procedure performed by a responding ASC facility we summed its allocated direct and indirect costs to determine a total cost for the procedure. We also calculated a ratio between each ASC procedures median cost under the OPPS and the median cost of the procedures APC group using the data obtained from CMS referred to as the OPPStoAPC cost ratio.", "Accordingly it is critical for IRS to effectively implement information security controls and an agency wide information security program in accordance with federal law and guidance. In a February 2016 update the agency reported that an additional 390000 accounts had been accessed. The online Get Transcript service has been unavailable since May 2015. The service on IRSs website allowed taxpayers to retrieve their IP PINs online by passing IRSs authentication checks. As we reported in March 2016 IRS has implemented numerous controls over key financial and tax processing systems however it had not always effectively implemented access and other controls including elements of its information security program. These controls include identification and authentication authorization cryptography audit and monitoring and physical security controls among others. Specifically IRS had established policies for developing contingency plans for its information systems and for testing those plans as well as for implementing and enforcing backup procedures. Nevertheless the control weaknesses can be attributed in part to IRSs inconsistent implementation of elements of its agencywide information security program. In addition the agency had not fully addressed previously identified deficiencies or ensured that its corrective actions were effective. In commenting on drafts of our reports presenting the results of our fiscal year 2015 audit the IRS Commissioner stated that while the agency agreed with our new recommendations it will review them to ensure that its actions include sustainable fixes that implement appropriate security controls balanced against IT and human capital resource limitations. IRS has taken steps to address IDT refund fraud however it remains a persistent and continually changing threat. IRS partners with financial institutions and other external parties to obtain information about emerging IDT refund trends and fraudulent returns that have passed through IRS detection systems. In November 2015 IRS reported that it had developed a database to track leads submitted by financial institutions and the results of those leads. In addition to filing returns many taxpayers often call IRS for assistance. From January 1 through March 19 2016 IRS received about 35.4 million calls to its automated and live assistor telephone lines about a 2 percent decrease compared to the same period last year. In April 2016 IRS officials told us that the agency established a team to consider our prior work in developing this strategy or benchmarking its telephone service.

The performance appraisal process for staff that evaluates the merits of applications filed with INS called adjudicators focused mainly on the number of applications reviewed not the quality of the review. This policy is intended to prevent aliens from having to wait for INS to adjudicate their application before they can work. An investigation into INS initiative to process naturalization applications more quickly found the initiative to be fraught with quality and integrity problems resulting in ineligible applicants receiving citizenship. As we reported in our applications processing report despite these pressures to complete applications more quickly INS backlog of applications increased to about 4 million applications by the end of fiscal year 2000 a fourfold increase since 1994. For example field and policy manuals were out of date and there was not one place that program staff could go for direction. Our recent work shows that coordination and communication is still a problem. INS Investigations officials told us that the autonomy of the individual units and the lack of a single chain of command to manage INS antismuggling investigations were major obstacles to building a more effective antismuggling program. In our H1B report we stated that adjudicators told us that they did not have easy access to casespecific information that would have helped them correctly decide whether an application should be approved or denied. INS had no single repository of information where adjudicators could find the most up to date information on such things as adjudication processes and legal and regulatory policies. On June 1 1999 the Border Patrol apprehended ResendezRamirez trying to cross illegally and had him processed through the IDENT system. INS failed to 1 1 ensure that components outside of the Border Patrol such as Investigations understood IDENT policies particularly the lookout policy and 2 provide adequate IDENT training for all INS staff. Effective communication has also been a problem between INS and local communities. Effectively using information technology continues to remain a challenge for INS. INS is in the process of developing this plan. Existing INS systems used to process applications do not provide accurate and reliable data. Due to the lack of accurate data in its computer systems INS will have to do another handcount of all pending applications at the end of fiscal year 2001 if it hopes to obtain an unqualified opinion on its financial statement. Our work indicates that INS needs to improve its program management in several fundamental areas including having efficient processes and clear policies and procedures providing adequate staff training and aligning its workforce with its workload.", "The health concerns over TCE have been further amplified in recent years after scientific studies have suggested additional risks posed by human exposure to TCE. In the current Congress legislation has been introduced that would require EPA to establish a health advisory for perchlorate as well as requiring public water systems serving more than 10000 people to test for perchlorate and disclose its presence in annual consumer confidence reports. Nevada required the KerrMcGee Chemical site in Henderson to treat groundwater and reduce perchlorate concentration releases to 18 ppb which is Nevadas action level for perchlorate. DOD is undertaking a number of activities to address emerging contaminants in general including the creation of the Materials of Evolving Regulatory Interest Team MERIT to systematically address the health environmental and safety concerns associated with emerging contaminants. As we have previously reported DOD must comply with cleanup standards and processes under applicable laws regulations and executive orders including EPA drinking water standards and statelevel standards. In the absence of a federal perchlorate standard DOD has also initiated perchlorate response actions to clean up perchlorate contamination at several active and formerly used defense sites under its current perchlorate policy.", "To help save costs in preparing for the 2020 Census the Bureau has been researching and testing new methods and technologies to redesign the Census to more costeffectively count the population while maintaining highquality results. In mid2015 the Bureau conducted the 2015 Census Test in Arizona to test among other things the use of a field operations management system to automate data collection operations and provide realtime data and the ability to reduce the nonresponse followup workload using data previously provided to the government as well as enabling enumerators to use their personally owned mobile devices to collect census data. Also in mid2015 the Bureau conducted an optimizing selfresponse test in Savannah Georgia and the surrounding area which was intended to further explore methods of encouraging households to respond using the Internet such as using advertising and outreach to motivate respondents and enabling households to respond without a Bureauissued identification number. As a result of these decisions the Bureau estimates saving 5.2 billion. The Bureau expects to reuse selected systems make modifications to other systems and develop or acquire additional systems and infrastructure. Specifically with preparations for endtoend testing less than 2 years away the window to implement CEDCAP which is intended to be the backbone of the 2020 Census is narrow. Additionally while the Bureau has demonstrated improvements in IT management as we have previously reported it faces critical gaps in its IT workforce planning and information security. The Bureau agreed with our recommendations and has taken steps to address them. For example in September 2014 the Bureau released a plan that identified inputs such as research questions design components and testing that were needed to inform the operational design decisions expected in the fall of 2015. In response in 2013 the Bureau completed an enterprisewide competency assessment and identified several missioncritical gaps in technical competencies. Additionally there are other gaps in key positions such as the Chief of the Office of Information Security and Deputy Chief Information Security Officer Big Data Center Chief Chief Cloud Architect and the CEDCAP Assistant Chief of Business Integration who is responsible for overseeing the integration of schedule risks and budget across the 12 projects.

However program officials indicate the services forecasts are generally inaccurate which can make demilitarization planning challenging. Officials stated that the amount of funding has caused them to be reluctant to initiate projects that increase demilitarization capacity or efficiency since these capabilities may not be utilized in the future due to funding shortfalls. Such transfers could allow DOD to reduce demilitarization costs and the size of the CAD stockpile while also reducing the need for other government agencies to procure new stocks of ammunition. To improve the completeness and accuracy of information on the weight of items in the CAD stockpilethe key measure used by DOD to manage the conventional ammunition demilitarization operation establish a plan to 1 identify and record to the extent possible the missing or inaccurate weight information for existing ammunition records in the CAD stockpile and 2 ensure that all items transferred to the CAD stockpile including for example components removed from larger weapons and nonstandard ammunition have the appropriate weight data. To improve the visibility and awareness of serviceable excess ammunition in the CAD stockpile that could potentially be transferred to other government agencies develop a systematic means to make information available to other government agencies on excess ammunition that could be used to meet their needs. The directives instructions and manuals we reviewed in the table above established and implemented policy as required. For example DOD Instruction 5160.68 assigns responsibilities and mission functions for conventional ammunition management to the Secretary of the Army the military services and USSOCOM. To assess the extent to which the Department of Defense DOD has adequately maintained and shared information on the quantity value condition and location of excess obsolete and unserviceable conventional ammunition for each military service we reviewed DODs inventory data on excess obsolete and unserviceable conventional ammunition held in the conventional ammunition awaiting demilitarization and disposal CAD stockpile as of February 2015 to determine how complete and accurate the data are. After initial discussions with DOD officials we determined that the department does not consider the value of ammunition in the management of its CAD stockpile so we did not review the value of the conventional ammunition. We interviewed service officials in the Army Navy Air Force and Marine Corps to learn how ammunition is managed once the decision is made to demilitarize and transfer it to the CAD stockpile. To describe DODs policies and procedures governing the demilitarization of excess obsolete and unserviceable conventional ammunition and discuss the extent to which they are consistent with DOD guidance for developing policies and procedures we obtained policies procedures and guidance on demilitarization.

The optimizer has been used by Joint Munitions Command since 1999 as a tool to assist in demilitarization program planning provide justification to answer questions received from Congress as well as Army headquarters and provide the most economic allocation of resources among the government depots. For example most of the depots have the capability to conduct demilitarization through open burn and open detonation. The cost of carrying out demilitarization is an estimate prepared by the depot of the cost to demilitarizing specific ammunition using a particular demilitarization capability. Additionally officials make adjustments to the optimizer results to ensure each depot is provided sufficient work to maintain demilitarization capabilities.", "These agreements are typically between DOE and states. DOEs six largest sites reported completing a total of 2901 of their 4262 milestones and met the original completion date for the milestones an average of 79 percent of the time. Specifically Many of the milestones do not indicate what cleanup work has been accomplished. DOE has reported that the remaining cleanup activities present enormous technical and management challenges and considerable uncertainties exist over the final cost and time frame for completing the cleanup. Regulators at the four sites we visited said that the compliance agreements they oversee and the milestones associated with those agreements provide a way to bring DOE into compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations. They said the agreements also help to integrate the requirements under various federal laws and allow regulators to track annual progress against DOEs milestone commitments. Because regulators have been so willing to adjust milestones DOE officials reported missing a total of only 48 milestones or about 1 percent of milestones that have been completed. The Presidents budget submitted to the Congress does not provide information on the amount of funding requested for DOEs compliance requirements. DOE sites prepare budget estimates that include compliance cost estimates and submit them for consideration by DOE headquarters. As a result of this process DOE sites usually have at least two different estimates of their compliance costs for the same budget year. The study reported that factors contributing to the failure of these efforts included a lack of consistent vision about how to use risk to establish work priorities the lack of confidence in the results by DOE personnel the unacceptability of the approaches to stakeholders at the sites and DOEs overall failure to integrate any of the approaches into the decision making process. DOEs new initiative provides additional funds for cleanup reform and is designed to serve as an incentive to sites and regulators to identify accelerated risk reduction and cleanup approaches. At the same time DOE is considering how best to develop a riskbased cleanup strategy. These initiatives affected how DOE approached the cleanup work the relationship DOE had with its contractors and in some cases the schedule for completing the work. Based on our review of past evaluations of these initiatives and discussions with DOE officials and regulators at DOE sites it appears that DOE proceeded with these initiatives without significant resistance or constraints as a result of the compliance agreements. Furthermore they said DOEs initiative lacked specific details and they had numerous questions about the criteria DOE will use to select sites and the process it will follow at those sites to develop an implementation plan to accelerate cleanup and modify cleanup approaches. Most regulators said they would not view as favorable any attempt by DOE to avoid appropriate waste treatment activities or significantly delay treatment by reducing funding available to sites. In addition these regulators said that if DOE misses the milestones after reducing the funding at individual sites they would enforce the penalty provisions in the compliance agreements.", "For example some adopted children may have histories of longterm institutionalization e.g. Most domestic adoptions handled through private adoption agencies attorneys and others primarily involve infants or adoptions by a stepparent. Unregulated transfers do not follow the adoption process which generally involves many steps to help ensure that the child is legally adopted and placed in an appropriate and permanent home. For these adoptions states set requirements for home studies preadoption training and postadoption services. Some federal funding is available for adoption services in addition to any funding from state local or other sources. International adoptions in the United States have changed over time from a system that predominantly involved the adoption of infants and toddlers to one that has involved an increasing proportion of older children and those with special needs. Many stakeholders we interviewedincluding officials from selected states child welfare and adoption organizations and adoption agencies expressed concern with the adequacy of the information provided to prospective parents on the behavioral and mental health conditions of a child adopted internationally. For example Wisconsin officials told us the state requires 18 hours of training and the same topics are required for international and foster care adoptions. All seven of our selected states provide some kind of postadoption services for families who adopted from foster care and internationally. It found that about onethird of these states offered almost no postadoption services other than a subsidy for adoptive families. Another limitation to accessing postadoption services that many stakeholders expressed concern about was the cost of intensive services which can be expensive for all families. Because we did not investigate these posts further and because discussions between online participants can be continued privately we were unable to determine whether a child was actually transferred to another family. Given limited funding officials from most selected states child welfare and adoption organizations and adoption agencies we interviewed expressed concern about the level of support for post adoption services. Additionally the revisions require families to disclose if they have experienced a disruption or dissolution of an international adoption in the past. Specifically we conducted interviews with 45 agencies and organizations including officials from federal and selected state agencies child welfare and adoption organizations and adoption agencies to acquire a range of perspectives on this topic reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations selected state laws and federal and selected state policies reviewed and analyzed documentation provided by officials we interviewed conducted a search of related literature and reviewed relevant articles and searched online forums on selected social media sites to find illustrative examples of families who may be considering unregulated transfers. In the states selected the team conducted interviews with officials from state child welfare agencies and other relevant offices such as those from state attorney general offices departments of justice and adoption agency licensing offices. To examine selected state efforts related to unregulated transfers we reviewed information on recently enacted laws proposed legislation and other documents provided by child welfare and other agency officials in our seven selected states. We analyzed posts on two of the eight forums that involved individuals who posted that they were seeking a new family for their child or who posted that they wanted to adopt a child.", "When a veteran submits a benefits claim to any of VBAs 57 regional offices a Veterans Service Representative VSR is responsible for obtaining the relevant evidence to evaluate the claim. VBA has designed a uniform curriculum for training new VSRs and RVSRs that is implemented in three phasesinitial orientation training a 3week training session referred to as centralized training and comprehensive on thejob and classroom training after centralizing training. For example each topic included in this training program contains a detailed lesson plan with review exercises student handouts and copies of slides used during the instructors presentation. Regional offices determine the training topics that are used to meet the remaining 20 hours based on local needs and input. According to central office officials they provide feedback to the regional offices on their current plans as well as guidance on what topics to include in the next years training plans. Although some regional offices collect some training feedback it is not shared with VBA central office. Experienced staff differed in their assessments of the VBAs annual training requirement with some indicating they struggle to meet this requirement because of workload pressures or that training topics are sometimes redundant or not relevant to their position. VBA has made some efforts to evaluate its training for claims processors. While some staff at all of the regional offices we visited told us that the additional training better prepared them to perform their jobs with onthe job training identified as a useful learning tool others told us that the training could not always be completed in a timely manner due to regional office priorities. In addition to elements that are evaluated in purely quantitative terms VBA uses a cooperation and organizational support element for VSRs and RVSRs that requires supervisors to assess whether their staff are exhibiting a number of behaviors related to performing well as a claims processor. Managers in one regional office commented that the system would produce more accurate overall performance ratings if staff were given an overall rating of excellent when they had for example exceptional ratings on three of five overall elements and fully successful ratings on the other two. In many ways VBA has developed a training program for its new staff that is consistent with accepted training practices in the federal government. For example VBA plans to consult with regional office staff to evaluate its annual 80hour training requirement and will examine if staff performance ratings clearly differentiate between overall performance levels.

Veterans Benefits Claims Further Improvements Needed in Claims Processing Accuracy.", "A hospital may generally qualify for SCH status by showing that because of factors such as isolated location weather conditions travel conditions or absence of other like hospitals it is the sole source of inpatient hospital services reasonably available in a geographic area. Since 1987 DHA has reimbursed hospitals for claims using the agencys DRGbased payment system which was modeled after Medicares system. Under this system claims are priced using an annual standard amount and a weighted value for each DRG. Instead DHA generally reimbursed SCHs based on their billed charges for inpatient care provided to TRICARE beneficiaries. Based on these calculations each SCH fell into one of two categories 1 SCHs with baseyear ratios higher than their Medicare costtocharge ratios or 2 SCHs with base year ratios lower than or equal to their Medicare costtocharge ratios. Twentyfour percent 111 of 459 of the hospitals that were designated as SCHs during fiscal year 2012 with baseyear ratios less than or equal to their Medicare costtocharge ratios did not qualify for a transition period because either their reimbursement increased to their Medicare costto charge ratio or they continued to be reimbursed at their Medicare costto charge ratio. According to TRICAREs fiscal year 2013 claims data 120 SCHs approximately 30 percent of all SCHs were already reimbursed using rates that were at or below their Medicare costtocharge ratios. We also found that the majority of SCHs58 percent 265 of 459had fewer than 20 TRICARE admissions during this time while 10 percent 44 of 459 had 100 or more TRICARE admissions. TRICARE beneficiaries demand for inpatient care at SCHs also may be affected by the availability of inpatient care from their respective military installation. We found that 24 of the 44 SCHs we identified as having 100 or more TRICARE admissions in fiscal year 2013about halfwere within 40 miles of a military installation that only had an outpatient clinic. We found that TRICARE inpatient admissions for these 24 facilities ranged from 101 to 2178 in fiscal year 2013 and 6 of them were among the 10 SCHs that we interviewed because they had the highest number of TRICARE admissions the highest reimbursement amounts or both. Officials from DHAs TRICARE Regional Offices and the managed care support contractors also told us that they have not received complaints or heard of issues from beneficiaries about their ability to access inpatient care at SCHs.

Third in contrast to a single bill for all the services provided during an episode of care under the previous fee schedule under reasonable charges VA must prepare a separate bill for each provider involved in the care and an additional bill if a hospital facility charge applies. The increased collections in fiscal year 2002 reflected that VA processed a higher volume of bills than it did in the prior fiscal year. For example a study completed last year estimated that 23.8 percent of VA patients in fiscal year 2001 had billable care but VA actually billed for the care of only 18.3 percent of patients. For example although Network 9 Nashville had above average increases in collections for both inpatient and outpatient care it still had coding backlogs in four of six medical centers.

Mr. Chairman this concludes my prepared remarks. GAO011157T.", "To help meet the first two strategic objectives noted above one of the key goals of TVAs 10year plan was to reduce debt from its 1997 levels by about onehalf to about 13.2 billion. recover the costs through rates of its deferred assets from about 8.5 billion to 500 million which TVA estimated to be the net realizable value of its deferred nuclear units. TVA planned to generate cash that could be used to reduce debt by increasing rates beginning in 1998 reducing expenses and limiting capital expenditures these actions would increase its financial flexibility and future competitiveness. To determine TVAs financial condition we analyzed TVAs debt and fixed costs and then compared TVA to its likely competitors. TVA officials attribute the 1.4 billion debt reduction shortfall over the first 3 years to four factors. TVA had forecast about 1.7 billion in capital expenditures over that 3year period its actual capital expenditures were almost 500 million more about 2.2 billion. TVAs overall plan for recovering the costs of its deferred assets through 2007 is being reduced significantly. Although reducing debt and the amount of deferred asset costs that have not yet been recovered are important to TVA as it prepares for competition TVAs future competitiveness will be based to a large degree on market conditions and how TVA will be restructured if and when TVA loses its legislative protections. TVA officials told us that higher projections are warranted now than when it prepared its plan in 1997 primarily due to projected increases in the price of natural gas but also due to a combination of other factors including the extreme volatility of spot prices in the summer months increasing power demands beyond what they expected 3 years ago shortages or at least shrinking surpluses of both generating and transmission capacity and a better understanding of the increased costs of complying with environmental regulations that are likely to take effect between now and 2007. To assess the progress TVA has made in achieving its key objective of altering its cost structure from a rigid high fixedtovariable cost relationship to a cost structure with more financial flexibility and to put TVAs financial condition in perspective we compared TVA to likely competitors in terms of 1 total financing costs 2 fixed financing costs and 3 net cash generated from operations as a percentage of expenditures for property plant and equipment and common stock dividends. If TVA is required to compete with other electricity providers depending on the market price of power and TVAs cost of providing power recovery of these deferred assets could be difficult. Although TVA enjoys these competitive advantages its high debt and unrecovered costs would present challenges in a competitive environment. Stranded costs occur when a utility moves from a regulated to a competitive environment and is unable to recover certain costs because the market price of power will not allow it to generate revenue at a level sufficient to recover these costs. The three deferred nuclear units with costs of about 6.3 billion as of September 30 2000 that TVA has not yet begun recovering are a primary reason for TVAs potential exposure to stranded costs. Writing off the costs of the overvalued assets to retained earnings immediately would mitigate potential stranded costs and eliminate the need to recover the cost of these assets from future ratepayers making a utilitys power rates potentially more competitive. If TVA is attempting to recover more of these costs than other utilities in a competitive market and as a result its rates are above market it could have stranded costs. As noted above due to the uncertainty of the future market price of power we also do not conclude on whether TVA will be competitive in the future. Debt and deferred assets The progress TVA has made in achieving the goals of its 10year business plan for reducing debt and deferred assets.", "A subset of consolidated contracts is bundled contracts that the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997 defines as the consolidation of two or more procurement requirements for goods or services previously provided or performed under separate smaller contracts into a solicitation of offers for a single contract that is likely to be unsuitable for award to a small business concern due to the diversity size or specialized nature of the elements of the the aggregate dollar value of the anticipated award the geographic dispersion of contract performance sites or any combination of these three criteria.

In fiscal years 1998 and 1999 when the legislative goal increased to 23 percent small businesses received 23 percent of total federal contract expenditures. SBA has identified several categories of procurements that are excluded from the base because SBA officials believe that small businesses do not have a reasonable opportunity to compete for them including 1 foreign military sales 2 procurement awarded and performed outside the United States 3 purchases from mandatory sources of supplies as listed in the Federal Acquisition Regulation and 4 purchases for specific programs from the Departments of State Transportation and the Treasury. Despite this overall decline in contract purchases small businesses received a higher share in fiscal year 1999 than in fiscal year 1993 of expenditures on new contracts worth 25000 or more than for 5 of the 8 categories of goods and services of government procurement equipment research and development architect and engineering automatic data processing services and other services. Since FPDS does not collect detailed data on purchase card expenditures we could not determine what share of such governmentwide expenditures are going to small businesses. We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Administrator of SBA the Director of OMB and the Administrator of GSA. We conducted our review between March and October 2000 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Staff acknowledgements are listed in appendix IV. Indefinitedelivery indefinitequantity contracts include GWACs and GSA federal supply schedule contracts. Authorized buyers at agencies place separate orders for individual requirements that specify the quantity and delivery terms associated with each order and the contractor delivers products or services directly to the agency. Our objectives were to identify 1 provisions in acquisition reform legislation enacted in the 1990s and other changes in procurement taking place during this time that could affect small business contractors and 2 trends that might indicate possible shifts in the ability of small businesses to obtain federal contracts in the 1990s. We also collected data from SBA and FPDC on the achievement of the governmentwide federal procurement goal for small businesses. Although FASA requires that contracts over 2500 up to 100000 be exclusively reserved for small businesses we could not determine the amount of expenditures or share going to small businesses for these contracts because in some cases information is reported to FPDC on contracts commingled with modifications. FPDC relies on agencies to report their procurement information. Orders by mail U.S. General Accounting Office P.O.", "For example in fiscal year 1995 California returned almost 16 million in unspent WIC funds which represented about 3 percent of its 528 million federal grant. States also had unspent federal funds because the use of vouchers to distribute benefits made it difficult for states to determine program costs until the vouchers were redeemed and processed. First some portion of the benefits issued as vouchers may not be used thereby reducing projected food costs. Other reasons for states having unspent WIC funds related to specific circumstances that affect program operations within individual states. The director of a local WIC agency in Pennsylvania allows working women to send in their paperwork before they visit thereby reducing the time spent at the clinic. Our survey found that about 76 percent of the local WIC agency directors believed that their clinics are reasonably accessible for working women. Specifically directors reported that some working women do not participate because they 1 lose interest in the programs benefits as their income increases 2 perceive a stigma attached to receiving WIC benefits or 3 think the program is limited to those women who do not work. Four of these state agencies and seven other state agenciesa total of 11 statesreported that they were considering or were in the process of expanding their use of rebates to foods other than infant formula. Californias WIC director told us that the state expects to collect about 12 million in annual rebates on the adult juices thereby allowing approximately 30000 more people to participate in the program each month. With respect to placing limits on food selections all of the 48 state WIC directors responding to our survey reported that their agencies imposed limits on one or more of the food items eligible for program reimbursement. Cost savings may be achieved if the states purchase special infant formula at wholesale instead of retail prices. These obstacles include problems that states have with existing program restrictions on how additional funds made available through cost containment initiatives can be used and resistance from the retail community when states attempt to establish selection requirements or limit retail stores participating in the program. First FNS policy requires that during the grant year any savings from cost containment accrue to the food portion of the WIC grant thereby allowing the states to provide food benefits to additional WIC applicants. FNS and some state WIC officials told us that limiting the number of vendors in the program is an important aspect of containing WIC costs. For example we found that some states requiring documentation of income will waive the requirement and permit selfdeclaration of income if the applicants do not bring income documents to their certification meeting. In our September 1997 report we recommended that FNS take the necessary steps to ensure that state agencies require participants to provide identification and evidence that they reside in the states where they receive benefits.

Some individuals have lost job opportunities been refused loans or even been arrested fo crimes they did not commit as a result of identity theft. The act defines federal requirements fo securing information and information systems that support federalaw governing information security in the agency operations and assets. In addition access controls can limit the activities that an employee c perform on data. We ound that VA did not adequately control changes to its operating Software change control procedures were not consistently implemented. Security policies and procedures VAs cyber security officer reported that VA has action ongoing to develop a process for collecting and tracking performance data ensuring management action when needed and providing independent validation of reported issues. However more remains to be done in this area. In addition to establishing a robust information security program agencies can take other actions to help guard against the possibil that personal information they maintain is inadvertently compromised. This can be done most effectively through the development of privacy impact assessments PIAs which as previously mentioned are required by the EGovernment Act of 2002 when agencies use information technology to process personal information. Breach notification is one way that organizationseither in the private sector or the governmentcan follow the openness principle and meet their responsibility for keeping the public informed of how their personal information is being used and who has access to it. Given these potential negative effects care is clearly needed in defining appropriate criteria for required breach notifications. If an agency is to notify people of a data breach it should do so in such a way that they understand the nature of the threat and what steps need to be taken to protect themselves against identity theft. Similarly providing context to the notice explaining to consu why they are receiving the notice and what to do with it has been found to promote comprehension as did visual design elem such as a tabular format large and legible fonts appropriate space and simple headings.

In addition to the technological economic and social challenges to developing oil shale resources there are a number of significant environmental challenges. Lastly the withdrawal of large quantities of surface water for oil shale operations could negatively impact aquatic life downstream of the oil shale development. In addition the surface that overlies the oil shale would need to be cleared and graded in preparation for mining or drilling boreholes for insitu extraction. Extensive withdrawals could reduce groundwater discharge to connected streams and springs which in turn could damage or remove riparian vegetation and aquatic life. Water is also needed throughout the life cycle of oil shale production for generating electricity from power plants needed in operations. Table 2 shows the minimum maximum and average amounts of water that could be needed for each of the groups of activities that comprise the life cycle of oil shale development that relies upon mining and surface retorting. This 1 barrel of water results primarily from the degree to which the resulting shale oil would need upgrading. Companies with interest in oil shale already hold significant water rights in the Piceance Basin of Colorado and representatives from all of the companies with whom we spoke felt confident that they either had or could obtain sufficient water rights to supply at least their initial operations in the Piceance and Uintah Basins. Many people who are knowledgeable on western water rights said that the owners of these rights in Utah and Colorado would most likely be agricultural users based on a history of senior agricultural rights being sold to developers in Colorado. There are less data available to predict future water supplies in Utahs oil shale resource area. Any amount withdrawn from the White River in Colorado would be that much less water that would be available for development downstream in Utah. Although the federal government sponsors research on the nexus between oil shale development and water a lack of comprehensive data on the condition of surface water and groundwater and their interaction limit efforts to monitor the future impacts of oil shale development. Currently DOE funds some research related to oil shale and water resources including research on water rights water needs and the impacts of oil shale development on water quality. Furthermore these uncertainties are compounded by a lack of knowledge of the current baseline conditions of groundwater and surface water including their chemistry and interaction properties of aquifers and the age and rate of movement of groundwater in the arid Piceance and Uintah Basins of Colorado and Utah where water is considered one of the most precious resources. Third DOE stated that using the amount of water in the White River at Meeker Colorado to illustrate the availability of water for commercial oil shale development understates water availability. Key contributors to this report are listed in appendix V. To determine what is known about the potential impacts to groundwater and surface water from commercial oil shale development we reviewed the Proposed Oil Shale and Tar Sands Resource Management Plan Amendments to Address Land Use Allocations in Colorado Utah and Wyoming and Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement PEIS prepared by the Bureau of Land Management in September 2008. To determine the extent to which water is likely to be available for commercial oil shale development and its source we compared the total needs of an oil shale industry of various sizes to the amount of surface water and groundwater that the states of Colorado and Utah estimate to be physically and legally available in light of future municipal and industrial demand.", "8348 the Congress authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to suspend additional investment of amounts in the Civil Service fund if such investment cannot be made without causing the amount of public debt to exceed the debt ceiling. In subsection g of 5 U.S.C. 4. This statute provided that the securities issued under its provisions were not to be counted against the debt ceiling until March 15 1996 which was later extended to March 30 1996. To evaluate the actions taken during the 19951996 debt ceiling crisis in relation to the normal policies and procedures Treasury uses for federal trust fund investments we obtained an overview of the procedures used. This set the stage for the 19951996 debt ceiling crisis which was resolved on March 29 1996 when Congress raised the debt ceiling to 5.5 trillion. Our analysis showed that during the 19951996 debt ceiling crisis Treasury used its normal investment and redemption procedures to handle the receipts and maturing investments and to redeem Treasury securities for 12 of the 15 trust funds we examined. The Secretary in the November 15 1995 determination stated that a debt issuance suspension period existed for a period of 12 months ased on the information that is available to me today. On November 15 1995 the Secretary authorized the redemption of 39.8 billion of the Civil Service funds Treasury securities and on February 14 1996 authorized the redemption of another 6.4 billion of the funds Treasury securities. During previous debt ceiling crises Treasurys actions resulted in uninvested cash. In addition by having an independent verification of the value of the exchanged securities Treasury helped to ensure that both the Civil Service fund and FFB were treated equitably in the exchange. In addition to the actions involving the Civil Service fund during the 19951996 debt ceiling crisis the Secretary of the Treasury 1 suspended the investment of GFund receipts and 2 did not reinvest some of the Exchange Stabilization Funds maturing securities. In other actions to stay within the debt ceiling the Congress passed legislation allowing Treasury to issue some Treasury securities that were temporarily exempted from being counted against the debt ceiling. Providing this legislation was important because during a debt ceiling crisis Treasury may not be free to issue securities in advance to raise the necessary cash. However since the securities would have been redeemed earlier than normal the trust fund would have lost interest income. Under the authority provided by this statute between March 13 and March 29 1996 Treasury issued about 58.2 billion in Treasury securities to government trust funds as investments of their receipts or reinvestments of their maturing securities. As a result the amount of debt subject to the debt ceiling decreased by this amount thus enabling Treasury to issue additional securities to the public for cash. To ensure that the fund would not have longterm losses the Congress provided Treasury with the authority to restore such losses once a debt ceiling crisis was resolved.", "In 1969 FCC adopted regulations applying sponsorship identification requirements modeled on the broadcast rules to cablecasting by community antenna television systems CATV. Political and controversial content must also have either type of announcement when aired on television but candidate advertisements have specific visual requirements. FCC does not require an announcement when an obvious connection exists between the content and sponsor such as with a standard commercial advertisement. These reviews check to ensure the advertisement or programming meets FCC requirements including the sponsorship identification requirements. Television and radio political advertisements authorized and paid for by a federal candidate or his or her campaign committee or another organization must include a disclaimer spoken by the candidate identifying him or herself and stating that he or she approved the advertisement as well as a statement identifying the organization that paid for the advertisement. Individuals political committees and other organizations supporting or opposing candidates for federal office are required to report campaign funding and expenditures for certain activities which can include payments made for purchasing political advertising and information on the funds they receive for advertisements. FEC has also required organizations and individuals to report expenditures for political advertisements and donations of 1000 or more made for certain political advertisements called electioneering communications which are related to elections for federal office and broadcasts within specified time frames before the elections. However some broadcasters indicated that FCC could clarify how the guidance applies in specific situations such as when a VNR or product is used but the broadcaster was not paid. While most complaints do not end with an enforcement action FCC generally does not communicate with the broadcaster named in the complaint when it closes sponsorship identification investigations. As previously indicated the letter of inquiry notifies the broadcaster named in the complaint that an investigation is under way but following that communication FCC does not provide any information on the investigation unless the case results in an enforcement action. GAO has previously reported that FCC enforcement actions can help correct identified compliance problems and deter future noncompliance.Similarly informing a broadcaster under investigation that a matter has been closed could help inform broadcasters about compliant activities. Most broadcasters told us they generally have no problems meeting the sponsorship identification requirements because they have processes in place to review all content and ensure it has a sponsorship announcement if needed. The letter should indicate the case has been closed but in doing so FCC could note that closing the case does not signify an endorsement of the actions that were being investigated and that the case could be reopened. To improve timeliness of investigations and ensure when possible that investigations are completed in an expeditious manner FCC should develop goals for completing sponsorship identification cases within a specific time frame and develop a means to measure and report on how well it meets those goals. When providing its technical comments FCC discussed the treatment of VNRs indicating that although the 2005 Public Notice states VNRs generally must have a sponsorship announcement recent cases involving VNR complaints have resulted in FCC treating VNRs similar to other programming subject to the sponsorship identification requirements. Specifically we 1 describe the sponsorship identification requirements and guidance for commercial and political content the federal election disclaimer requirements as well as stakeholders views of these requirements and guidance and 2 assess how and to what extent FCC and FEC address sponsorship complaints through each agencys enforcement process. In addition we analyzed relevant FCC and FEC documents describing agency methods and processes for identifying violations receiving sponsorship identification complaints communicating with the complainant and subject of the complaint initiating and conducting investigations and taking enforcement actions. To determine the extent to which FEC addresses disclaimer statement complaints we analyzed all FEC disclaimer statement cases including cases dismissed by FEC and all FEC disclaimer statement enforcement actions from 2000 through May 15 2012.", "Retail alternatives are increasingly important to USPS revenues from all retail alternativesincluding selfservice kiosks in post offices USPSs website and CPUs among othersincreased by about 1.6 billion from fiscal years 2007 to 2011 while post office revenues decreased by 3 billion. See fig. According to USPS officials USPS is currently in the process of finalizing its retail strategy. According to USPS CPUs offer potential service and financial benefits and as we have previously reported some foreign posts have successfully used private partnerships similar to CPUs to realize such benefits. In addition all CPUs are contractually prohibited from selling services including private mailboxes and others that are competitive with USPSs products and all CPU contracts specify USPSs rights to inspect the CPU at any time during operating hours. USPS has other partnerships with private entities to provide retail postal services similar to CPUs. In addition CPUs allow USPS to provide customer access at times often beyond the hours of service at post offices. Although USPS does not track specific reasons for CPU closures in its contract postal unit technology CPUT database retail managers in eight USPS districts that we met with cited specific local issues resulting in CPU closures including the following The CPU operator retired or otherwise stopped working. For example a CPU operator in Virginia closed the CPU because he felt it did not help his primary business. Consistent with the majority of CPUs being within 2 miles of a post office CPUs are also more likely to be in urban than rural areas and recent CPU openings further demonstrate this pattern. Furthermore since USPS compensates CPUs with performancebased contracts a percentage of the CPUs sales USPS does not compensate these CPUs more than it receives in revenues a situation that can happen with CPUs with fixedprice contracts. On average CPUs that closed from fiscal years 2008 to 2011 generated roughly 26 percent less revenue on average in the year prior to closure than the average CPU revenue for that year. The subsequent decline in USPS compensation to CPUs from fiscal years 2008 to 2011 was because of declining numbers of CPUs during the time. As USPS continues to develop this retail strategy we believe that USPS can capitalize on growing acceptance of retail alternatives by using information about CPUs to inform its decisions. Location data for each CPU in CPUT includes a physical address including city state and ZIP4 code. As a result we were able to determine the revenues and USPS compensation to each CPU for CPUs that opened in each fiscal year. We determined that the FDB post office and CPU hoursofservice data were sufficiently reliable for overall comparison purposes. We also interviewed USPS officials responsible for implementing the CPU program CPU operators and USPS district retail managers at the sites and districts discussed earlier regarding current CPU operations and challenges the CPU program might face going forward.", "To the extent that the appropriated amount does not fully fund housing agencies at their eligible amounts HUD reduces the funding housing agencies receive to fit within the appropriated amount. Several factors affected voucher program costs as measured through congressional appropriations HUD outlays and housing agencies expenditures and in some cases contributed to cost increases from 2003 through 2010 including 1 increases in subsidy costs for existing vouchers 2 subsidy costs for new vouchers and 3 administrative fees paid to housing agencies. As previously discussed the subsidies HUD and housing agencies pay to landlords on behalf of assisted households are based on market rents and household incomes. As incomes decline voucherassisted households are paying less towards rent requiring larger subsidies to cover the difference between the rents and tenant payments. Beginning in fiscal year 2003 Congress changed the voucher programs funding formula so that it would provide housing agencies with renewal funding that was tied to housing agencies actual costs and leasing rates rather than the number of authorized vouchers whether used or unused. According to HUD officials HUD intends to use this study as a basis for future legislative proposals which could have implications for the cost of administering the program. Housing agencies have accumulated subsidy reserves unspent funds that Congress could use to 1 reduce program appropriations through a rescission and offset and potentially meet other federal needs or 2 direct HUD to assist additional households. As previously discussed HUD allocates subsidy funding to housing agencies based on the formula Congress establishes in annual appropriations legislation. As a result to meet the 650 million rescission goal HUD would have to offset more funds from housing agencies reserves than would be required under a onemonth reserve criterion potentially resulting in some housing agencies holding less than a one month reserve for contingencies. If implemented rent reform that is changes to the calculation of households payment toward rent and the consolidation of voucher administration under fewer housing agencies could yield substantial cost savings allow housing agencies to serve additional households if Congress were to reinvest annual cost savings in the voucher program or both.cost savings or additional households served could be greater if both options were implemented. Under existing program rules a household could pay no rentif the household has no monthly income after adjustments the housing agency from which the household receives assistance does not have a minimum rent or the household obtained a hardship exemption. In addition under an option where households rental payments are based on a percentage of the fair market rent lowerincome households would pay a larger percentage of their income toward rent than higher income households. Based on our literature review and interviews with HUD and housing industry officials consolidation of voucher program administration under fewer housing agencies administrative consolidation could yield a more efficient oversight and administrative structure for the voucher program and cost savings for HUD and housing agencies however current information on the magnitude of these savings was not available. As previously discussed HUD pays housing agencies a higher rate for the first 600 vouchers a housing agency has under lease and a lower rate for the remaining units under lease. Several of these proposals have advocated administrative consolidation as a means of creating administrative efficiencies. In addition HUD recently initiated changes to its housing agency consortium rule. Consolidation might help HUD more readily achieve deconcentration goals. To help reduce voucher program costs or better ensure the efficient use of voucher program funds we recommend that the HUD Secretary provide information to Congress on 1 housing agencies estimated amount of excess subsidy reserves and 2 its criteria for how it will redistribute excess reserves among housing agencies so that they can serve more households.", "Although some categories of overpayments are more difficult than others to detect or recover Labors analysis suggests that the states could have potentially detected and recovered about 1.3 billion 54 percent of the 2.4 billion in estimated overpayments in 2001. In addition while some of the states we visited use automated data sources to determine if claimants are working or obtaining other benefits while receiving UI others rely heavily on selfreported information from claimants to make payment decisions. Labor has taken some actions to improve UI program integrity such as working to obtain additional automated data sources that could help states make more accurate eligibility decisions and developing a payment accuracy performance measure. However one official familiar with the system noted that while it contains the necessary data to show whether a claimant is earning wages in another participating state it currently lacks important pieces of information such as states new hires data that would make it most useful as an interstate verification tool. However one state we visited reported that it does not perform any verification of the SSNs that UI claimants submit because a prior system it used for verifying SSNs identified only a small number of potential violations. For example some states tend to focus most of their staff and resources on meeting certain measures such as payment timeliness but may neglect other activities such as those dealing with program integrity in the process. GAO01779.", "Specifically they did not reflect what the land was being used for the highest and best use of the land or the values of any urban uses. The data in table 2 are based on a sample from a database of fees that BPA paid to state and private landowners. In comparison in 1990 the Forest Services fee schedule produced an annual fee of 14.88 per acre for land located in the same county as the private land. Therefore instances may arise when a fee schedule will charge fees that are significantly different from fair market valueas our analysis has shown. It too would involve developing a new fee schedule based on recent appraisals and market data. Onetime billing and consolidated billing would reduce costs to both the agency and the permittee. In most cases nonfederal landowners charge higher fees for similar rightsofway. While there are a number of options available to accomplish this goal the option of establishing fees based on local market data or sitespecific appraisals paid for by the users of rightsofway appears to be the most attractive because it collects fair market value for each rightofway and also reduces the agencys administrative costs. We have revised the report to reflect this comment. Our review included rightsofway managed by the U.S. Department of Agricultures Forest Service. Our work addressed the major commercial users of rightsofway oil and gas pipelines power lines and communications lines.

Some countries have already established regulations for flying UASs or formal processes for exemptions while others have taken steps to completely ban all UAS operations. FAA has taken a number of steps to move toward further safe integration of UAS in the national airspace in response to key requirements of the 2012 Act. FAA has developed the following planning documents In November 2013 FAA issued the UAS Comprehensive Plan identifying six highlevel strategic goals for integrating UAS into the national airspace including routine public operation and routine civil operations. Each collaborative group has defined different longterm goals in support of UAS integration and has made progress toward the achieving these goals. For example FAA regularly holds conference calls and convenes technical interchange meetings with test site officials to address test site issues. Specifically from April through August 2014 each of the six test sites became operational and signed an Other Transaction Agreement with FAA establishing their research and development relationship. All flights at a test site must be authorized under the authority of a COA or an experimental certificate approved by FAA. FAA and the test sites have found ways to allow quicker access to the test site airspace and relieve some administrative burden from FAA. Previously all UASs needed their own COA when operating at a test site but this action by FAA will allow any small UASs to operate at the test sites within the COAs requirements. Despite the progress made since they began operating according to test site operators they faced a number of challenges in the first year of operations Guidance on research According to FAA because the test sites receive no federal funding FAA can neither direct specific research to be conducted nor direct the test sites to share specific research data other than the operations and safety data required by the COA. FAA has used cooperative research and development agreements federally funded research and development centers and grants to conduct other UAS research and development. According to numerous studies and stakeholders we interviewed many countries around the world have been allowing commercial UAS operations in their airspace for differing purposes. This category goes beyond FAAs proposed rules by proposing regulations for large UAS operations and operations beyond the pilots visual line of sight. Approvals for commercial UAS operations have increased in these four countries and some allow more commercial operations. Other countries face challenges that are common across some countries including the United States trying to integrate UAS operations. This report focuses on FAAs efforts to develop procedures to allow UAS use within the national airspace system. Reviewed documents provided by and interviewed federal and industry representatives from the collaborative groupsthe Executive Committee RTCA Special Committee 228 UAS Aviation Rulemaking Committee and ASTM International Committee F38and industry groups that are involved in FAAs efforts to integrate UAS into the national airspace system To identify research and development support from FAAs test sites and other resources we Reviewed and analyzed documents from each of the six test sites where FAA has recently allowed UAS operations including the applications submitted by the selected test sites and quarterly reports provided to FAA.", "CMS has made progress in strengthening provider enrollment provisions but needs to do more to identify and prevent potentially fraudulent providers from participating in Medicare. Specifically to strengthen the existing screening activities conducted by CMS contractors the agency added screenings of categories of provider enrollment applications by risk level contracted with new national enrollment screening and site visit contractors and began imposing moratoria on new enrollment of certain types of providers. According to 2010 data from OIG and DOJ over 10000 providers that serve Medicare Medicaid and Childrens Health Insurance Program beneficiaries were involved in fraud investigations including not only home health agencies and DMEPOS suppliers but also physicians hospitals and pharmacies.In addition the provider type constituting the largest percentage of subjects in criminal health care fraud investigations was medical facilitiesincluding medical centers clinics or practiceswhich constituted almost a quarter of subjects in such investigations. National Enrollment Screening and Site Visit Contractors CMS contracted with two new types of entities at the end of 2011 to assume centralized responsibility for two functions that had been the responsibility of multiple contractors. In January 2014 CMS extended its first moratoria and added enrollment moratoria for new home health agency providers in Fort Lauderdale Detroit Dallas and Houston and new ground ambulance suppliers in Philadelphia. CMS reported in April 2014 that it had not scheduled for publication a proposed rule to implement the PPACA surety bond requirement for other types of atrisk providers and supplierssuch as home health agencies and independent diagnostic testing facilities. CMS has taken steps to improve the development of other types of prepayment edits that are implemented nationwide as we recommended. A CMS official reported last month that ZPICs are now using FPS as a primary source of leads for fraud investigations though the official did not provide details on how much of ZPICs work is initiated through the system. We also recently made recommendations to CMS to address the millions of Medicare cards that display beneficiaries Social Security numbers In August which increases beneficiaries vulnerability to identity theft.2012 we recommended that CMS 1 select an approach for removing Social Security numbers from Medicare cards that best protects beneficiaries from identity theft and minimizes burdens for providers beneficiaries and CMS and 2 develop an accurate welldocumented cost estimate for such an option. To help address potential vulnerabilities in that program we are examining practices for promoting prescription drug program integrity and the extent to which CMSs oversight of Medicare Part D reflects those practices. We are also examining CMSs oversight of some of the contractors that conduct reviews of claims after payment.

Finland encourages accurate withholding of taxes from taxpayers income lowers its costs and reduces taxpayers filing burdens through Internet based electronic services. A September 2008 report to the EU Council described the status of the directives implementation. The Australian High Net Wealth Individuals HNWI program focuses on the characteristics of wealthy taxpayers that affect their tax compliance. To tackle the problem ATO began to view wealthy taxpayers as part of a group of related business and other entities. By early May the Inland Revenue Department IRDthe tax administratorannually prepares individual tax returns for taxpayers based on information returns filed by employers. IRD then will review the returns and determine if any additional tax is due. IRS is actively involved in two international tax organizations and one jointly run program that addresses common tax administration issues. The WFF Tax Credits program is an umbrella program that spans certain tax credits administered by the IRD as well as discretionary spending programs administered by the Ministry of Social Development MSD. Finland has been operating a taxreturn preparation system since 2006. Some taxpayers will correct information returns when reviewing their prepared tax returns. According to Tax Administration officials electronic systems that provide routine taxpayer assistance allows Tax Administration staff to respond to more complex taxpayer problems. The directive is a multilateral agreement that establishes uniform procedures and definitions for exchanging information and facilitating the resolution of common technical problems. Information reporting helps HMRC and the individual taxpayer determine the total income tax liability according to HMRC officials. The information provided by employers enables HMRC to update the employees tax record and issue a tax code to the new employer to start the withholding against employee earnings. Employers are to match the PAYE code to a tax table which shows how much tax to withhold each pay period. Further the United States taxes many forms of income beyond salary income on the individual tax return. In the United States about half of all tax revenue is collected by the national government and about half is collected by the 50 states and tens of thousands of local governments.", "The SCAP regulators developed economic assumptions to estimate the potential impact of further losses on BHCs capital under two scenarios. The potential for loss arising from adverse business decisions or improper implementation of decisions. The Federal Reserve OCC and FDIC had representatives on each SCAP team the Analytical Group Supervisory Analytical and Advisory Teams and the Capital Assessment Group. However some BHCs told us that the Federal Reserve made substantial efforts to help ensure conformity with the indicative loan loss rates while incorporating BHCspecific information where possible and reliable. The quality of capitalmeasured as that portion of capital made up of tier 1 common equityalso increased across most of the BHCs in 2009. Similarly stock market prices since the release of the stress test results in May 2009 through October 2009 improved substantially in the overall banking sector and among the 18 public BHCs that participated in SCAP see figure 5. Actual economic performance in 2009 differed from the SCAP macroeconomic variable inputs which were based on a scenario that was more adverse than was anticipated or than occurred and other forces in the business and regulatory environment could have influenced the timing and level of losses. Losses were projected at 17 of the BHCs under the pro rata more adverse scenario and SCAP regulators did not consider the remaining 2 BHCs American Express Company and Morgan Stanley to be applicable for this category. The SCAP stress test provided lessons in a number of areas that can be incorporated in the bank supervision process and used to improve BHCs risk management practices. While Federal Reserve officials have discussed possible options for increasing transparency the regulators have yet to engage in a formal dialogue about these issues and have not formalized a plan for the public disclosure of regulatory banking information or developed a plan for integrating public disclosures into the ongoing supervisory process. Although the Federal Reserve has required BHCs to conduct stress tests since 1998 officials from several BHCs noted that their institutions had not conducted rigorous stress tests in the years prior to SCAP a statement that is consistent with regulatory findings during the same period. Going forward such models and analytics would facilitate improved risk identification and assessment capabilities and oversight including the oversight of systemic risk. Going forward based on our discussions with various SCAP participants and statements by Federal Reserve officials including the chairman the regulators experience with SCAP is anticipated to lead to the expanded use of horizontal examinations and multidisciplinary staff that will require extensive interagency coordination. The objectives of this report were to 1 describe the process used to design and conduct the stress test and participants views of the process 2 describe the extent to which the stress test achieved its goals and compare its estimates with the bank holding companies BHC actual results and 3 identify the lessons regulators and BHCs learned from the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program SCAP and examine how each are using those lessons to enhance their risk identification and assessment practices. We analyzed the initial stress test data that the Federal Reserve provided to each BHC the subsequent adjustments the Federal Reserve made to these estimates and the reasons for these adjustments. This means that the net amount of the trading gains or losses as reported in the Y9C are included in two places in our tracking table for those five BHCs. We used the SCAP results document to identify BHCs that were required to raise capital. We aggregated loan balance data into the same categories that were used in the indicative loss rate table in SCAP firstlien mortgages prime mortgages AltA mortgages subprime mortgages secondjunior lien mortgages closedend junior liens home equity lines of credit commercial and industrial loans commercial real estate loans construction loans multifamily loans nonfarm nonresidential loans credit card balances other consumer and other loans.", "Available data showed that case dispositions and processing times in disciplinary cases during the period of January 1 1996 through June 30 1998 differed for SES employees and lowerlevel or general schedule GS staff. These reasons included poor casetracking procedures inadequate file management and poor communication among agency officials involved in the disciplinary process. In 1997 and 1998 IRS studied the effect of the guide on GS and SES employees and found that actions taken against lowergraded employees more closely conformed to the guide than those taken against highergraded employees see table 3 for GS employees overall 91 percent of disciplinary actions conformed to the guide versus 74 percent for SES employees when disciplinary actions did not conform to the guide the actions were below the guides prescribed range 93 percent of the time for GS employees overall versus 100 percent of the time for GS13 through GS15 and SES employees and if admonishments were included as part of reprimands conformance with the guide approached 100 percent for GS13 through GS15 employees. Further IRS had poor casetracking procedures inadequate file management missing and incomplete files and poor communication among officials involved in the disciplinary process. Within 30 days the recommending official was to review the case with the help of local labor relations experts develop any additional facts deemed appropriate and return a case report to OES including a recommendation for disposition. Our review identified several concerns surrounding IRS files records and miscellaneous procedures for executive misconduct cases. Some information was available on the number of IRSrelated whistleblowing reprisal cases resolved by the two agencies responsible for considering such cases. A party dissatisfied with a case decision may file a petition for review by MSPBs threemember board. Before the IRS Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 IRS did not systematically collect information on retaliation against taxpayers. IRS process for doing audits of taxpayers returns and closing related disputes over additional recommended taxes has several steps. Specific problems cited in the report included little recent diversity training a belief by certain minority employees that stereotypes negatively affected their treatment difficulties in widely disseminating information gaps in EEO communication no formal mentoring program and much dissatisfaction with how employees were selected for promotion. For instance many recommendations dealt with the teams findings related to the districts EEO process for resolving issues in a precomplaint stage and its relationship to Treasurys formal complaint process. In addition we interviewed IRS officials and investigated entries under specific codes in various databases to see if relevant issues appeared. The Douglas Factors are as follows The nature and seriousness of the offense and its relation to the employees duties position and responsibilities including whether the offense was intentional or technical or inadvertent or was committed maliciously or for gain or was frequently repeated the employees job level and type of employment including supervisory or fiduciary role contacts with the public and prominence of the position the employees past disciplinary record the employees past work record including length of service performance on the job ability to get along with fellow workers and dependability the effect of the offense upon the employees ability to perform at a satisfactory level and its effect upon supervisors confidence in the employees ability to perform assigned duties consistency of penalty with those imposed upon other employees for the same or similar offenses consistency of the penalty with the applicable agency table of penalties the notoriety of the offense or its impact on the reputation of the agency the clarity with which the employee was on notice of any rules that were violated in committing the offense or had been warned about the conduct in question potential for employees rehabilitation mitigating circumstances surrounding the offense such as unusual job tensions personality problems mental impairment harassment or bad faith malice or provocation on the part of others involved in the matter and the adequacy and effectiveness of alternative sanctions to deter such conduct in the future by the employee or others.

Numerous laws assign privacy responsibility to senior agency officials. Most recently in 2005 OMB directed agencies to designate an SAOP with agency wide responsibility for information privacy issues and with responsibility for specific privacy functions including ensuring agency compliance with all federal privacy laws playing a central policymaking role in the development of policy proposals that implicate privacy issues and ensuring that contractors and employees are provided with adequate privacy training. In 2006 OMB issued further guidance requiring agencies to include as part of their FISMA reports a section addressing measures for protecting personally identifiable information. Privacy reporting Agency senior privacy officials are often required to prepare periodic reports to ensure transparency about their activities and compliance with the law. While more than one organizational unit carried out privacy functions in two cases Veterans Affairs and the Social Security Administration all such units were overseen by the senior agency official for privacy. If an SAOP was designated in such agencies without reassigning these responsibilities that official may not have oversight and involvement in all key privacy activities. At that time we will send copies of this report to the Attorney General the Secretaries of Commerce Defense Health and Human Services Homeland Security State Treasury Labor Transportation and Veterans Affairs the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration and the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development as well as other interested congressional committees. We also analyzed the specific privacy responsibilities identified in these laws and guidance and categorized the key privacy functions they represented. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Section 1011 of this act required the Director of National Intelligence to appoint a Civil Liberties Protection Officer and gave this officer the following functions ensuring that the protection of civil liberties and privacy is appropriately incorporated into the policies and procedures of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the elements of the intelligence community within the National Intelligence Program overseeing compliance by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence with all laws regulations and guidelines relating to civil liberties and privacy reviewing complaints about abuses of civil liberties and privacy in Office of the Director of National Intelligence programs and operations ensuring that technologies sustain and do not erode privacy protections ensuring that personal information contained in a system of records subject to the Privacy Act is handled in full compliance with fair information practices as set out in that act conducting privacy impact assessments when appropriate or as required performing such other duties as may be prescribed by the Director of National Intelligence or specified by law.", "Under FECA workers compensation benefits are authorized for employees who suffer temporary or permanent disabilities resulting from workrelated injuries or diseases. Concerns that beneficiaries remain in the FECA program past retirement age have led to several proposals to change the program. Under current rules an ageeligible employee with 30 years of service covered by FERS could accrue pension benefits that are 30 percent of their average high3 pay and under CSRS could accrue almost 60 percent of their high3 average pay. The first proposal would convert FECA benefits for workers who are injured or become ill to regular federal employee retirement benefits at retirement age. In 1981 the Reagan administration proposed comprehensive FECA reform including a provision to convert FECA benefits to retirement benefits at age 65. Proponents also argued that a FECA annuity would keep the changed benefit within the FECA program thereby avoiding complexities associated with converting FECA benefits under CSRS and FERS. Some noted that without the protections of the workers compensation program injured employees who have few years of service or are ineligible for retirement might suffer large reductions in benefits. Under previous proposals partially disabled individuals receiving reduced compensation would receive the lesser of the FECA annuity or the current reduced benefit. For example current beneficiaries could be given notice that their benefits would be changed after a certain number of years. Another question is whether to use secondary criteria to delay changed benefits in certain cases. For the retirement conversion alternative another issue is the funding of any retirement benefit shortfall. In this approach agencies might make annual payments to cover the shortfall resulting from the conversions. GAO03158R. Washington D.C. May 9 2002.

Of the 15 highrisk areas the 8 DODspecific highrisk areas cut across all of DODs major business areas. Enterprise transition plan DOD guidance states that the enterprise transition plan is intended to lay out a road map for achieving DODs business transformation by implementing changes to technology processes and governance consistent with DODs business enterprise architecture. For example the Deputy Secretary of Defense chairs an advisory board called the Deputys Advisory Working Group which DOD officials have stated has a role in overall business transformation. DOD continues to be challenged in its business transformation efforts because it has not developed a comprehensive integrated and enterprisewide action plan or set of linked plans for business transformation that is supported by a comprehensive planning process. Finally we determined that DODs business transformation efforts are currently guided by multiple plans that are developed and maintained by various offices within DOD. The Defense Business Board recommended that DOD develop a strategic plan that contains clear goals and supporting objectives including outcomebased metrics. Because of the complexity and longterm nature of business transformation we have long advocated the establishment of a CMO position at DOD with significant authority and experience and a term that would provide sustained leadership and the time to integrate the departments overall business transformation efforts. To ensure successful and sustained business transformation at DOD we recommend that the Secretary of Defense take the following two actions Institutionalize in directives the roles responsibilities and relationships among various businessrelated entities and committees such as the Defense Business Systems Management Committee investment review boards the Business Transformation Agency and the Deputys Advisory Working Group and expand the management framework to capture overall business transformation efforts rather than limit efforts to modernizing business systems. In written comments on a draft of this report DOD generally concurred with our recommendations that the department institutionalize a management framework and develop a comprehensive strategic planning process for business transformation and disagreed with our matter for congressional consideration that Congress enact legislation to establish a separate fulltime CMO position. Specifically the board endorsed the CMO concept in a study completed in May 2006 the Institute for Defense Analyses identified the need for a CMO in its study completed in December 2006 and DOD in a May 2007 letter informed Congress of its view that the Deputy Secretary of Defense should assume CMO responsibilities. Specifically DOD concurred with our first recommendation that the department institutionalize in directives the roles responsibilities and relationships among various businessrelated entities and committees and expand the management framework beyond business systems modernization to capture overall business transformation efforts. In our view DODs plan to subsume the CMO duties within the Deputy Secretary of Defense position and to establish this action by directive would place the responsibilities at the appropriate levelExecutive Level IIbut would result in a position not subject to a term or able to focus fulltime attention on business transformation. As stated in our report we believe codifying a separate fulltime CMO position in statute would also help to create unambiguous expectations and underscore congressional desire to follow a professional nonpartisan sustainable and institutional approach to this position.

However in its plans DOD has not demonstrated how its Education and Training Directorate projects will result in cost savings through a fully developed business case analysis including an analysis of benefits costs and risks. GAO1449. DOD established METC as part of the 2005 BRAC process to provide interservice training for enlisted service members and to achieve cost savings. However DOD is unable to determine whether the consolidation of medical education and training for enlisted personnel at METC has resulted in cost savings because it did not establish a baseline for spending on education and training prior to METCs establishment. GAOs Business Process Reengineering Assessment Guide states that performance measures are a critical part of a comprehensive implementation process to ensure that a new process is achieving the desired results. Surveys The METC Memorandum of Agreement states that METC and the services will conduct external evaluations to document program efficacy and to facilitate curriculum review by gathering feedback to measure whether the training received was relevant and to determine whether the graduates are proficient in their job duties. To help ensure that DOD has the necessary information to determine the extent to which cost savings result from any future consolidation of training within METC or the Education and Training Directorate we recommend that Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs direct the Director of the DHA to develop baseline cost information as part of its metrics to assess achievement of cost savings. Its initial training course was radiography specialist.", "The GSA study on office supply purchases reviewed 14 categories of mostly consumable office supplies ranging from paper and writing instruments to calendars and filing supplies. The report also found that agencies often paid morea price premiumthan they would have by using the GSA schedules program or OS II. The report also concluded that buyers engaged in at least some level of price comparisons before making purchasing decisions. GSA used several sources of data to analyze and compare the prices paid for 219 items across 14 categories of office supplies through various purchasing options. The GSA report acknowledged some limitations with the data but we identified additional data and other limitations that lead us to question the magnitude of some of GSAs reported price premiums. In addition when we reviewed some of the individual transaction data GSA obtained for retail purchases we identified substantial price variations for a number of drawing and graphic arts supplies and writing instruments that carried the same manufacturers part number. These transactions were all with the same nationwide retailer. When we used the formula described in the study to recalculate the retail price premiums for those 10 categories of office supplies we found the price premiums would have changed from what GSA reported by less than 5 percentage points for all categories except drawing and graphic arts supplies. The GSA report did not identify or collect any data about price comparisons conducted by the cardholders. On the basis of the sales data provided by OS II vendors GSA estimates the federal government saved 16 million from June 2010 through August 2011 by using these BPAs. Sales realized by one of the BPA vendors reached the first tier discount level in September 2011 and the vendor has since adjusted its prices to provide the corresponding price discounts. GSA expects that OS II will result in lower governmentwide costs for office supplies as more agencies move from their agencyspecific BPAs for office supplies to the OS II BPAs. GSA has incorporated a range of activities representative of a strategic procurement approach into the OS II initiative including aspects of managing the suppliers. Because government purchase cards were the most common way to purchase office supplies OS II includes a point of sale discount under which BPA prices are automatically charged whenever a government purchase card is used for an item covered by the BPA rather than having the buyers ask for a discount. We provided a draft of this report to GSA DHS and DOD. In its comments GSA said it was pleased that our report affirmed that savings can be achieved through leveraged purchasing and better understanding of spend data.", "Corporate governance guidelines in the private sector state that governing bodies should establish committees that will enhance their overall effectiveness by ensuring focus and oversight for areas of concern. 1301a Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 IPIA Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002 ATDA Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 GPRA Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act of 1982 FMFIA Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 FISMA Travel Transportation and Subsistence 5 U.S.C.

In addition to receiving benefits from DOD veterans may receive compensation from VA for lost earning capacity due to serviceconnected disabilities. Although the Army has made significant progress in staffing its Warrior Transition Units several challenges remain including hiring medical staff in a competitive market replacing temporarily borrowed personnel with permanent staff and getting eligible servicemembers into the units. A central goal of the Armys efforts is to make the system more servicemember and familyfocused and the Army has initiated efforts to determine how well the units are meeting servicemembers needs. Injured and ill servicemembers who must undergo a fitness for duty assessment and disability evaluation rely on the expertise and support of several key staffboard liaisons legal personnel and board physicians to help them navigate the process. Ideally according to the Army servicemembers should receive legal assistance during both the medical and physical evaluation board processes. While the Army has plans to address gaps in legal support for servicemembers challenges with hiring and staff turnover could limit their efforts. In August 2007 the Army established a goal of one medical evaluation board physician for every 200 servicemembers. For example according to an Army official physicians are having difficulty managing their caseload even at locations where they have met or are close to the Armys goal of 1 physician for 200 servicemembers due not only to the volume of cases but also their complexity. In addition to increasing the number of staff who support this process the Army has reported other progress and efforts underway that could further ease the disability evaluation process. Specifically the Armys target is for 80 percent of the medical evaluation board cases to be completed in 90 days or less but the percent that met the standard declined from 70 percent in October through December 2006 to 63 percent in October through December 2007. The Army is in the process of developing satisfaction surveys that are separate from the Warrior Transition Unit survey to gauge servicemembers perceptions of the medical and physical evaluation board processes. Prior to implementing the pilot in November 2007 the agencies conducted a 5day table top exercise that involved a simulation of cases intended to test the relative merits of 4 pilot options. This table top exercise enabled DOD and VA to obtain sufficient information to support a nearterm decision to implement the pilot but it also required some tradeoffs. While expanding the pilot outside the Washington D.C. area will likely yield useful information to pilot planners due to the time needed to fully process cases planners may have limited pilot results available to guide their decision making. DOD and VA are collecting data on decision times and rating percentages but have not identified how much improvement in timeliness or consistency would justify expanding the pilot process. Today the Army has established Warrior Transition Units at its major medical facilities and doctors nurses and fellow servicemembers at these units are at work helping wounded injured and ill servicemembers through what is often a difficult healing process. Going through two complex disability evaluation processes can be difficult and frustrating for servicemembers and veterans.", "USDAs Risk Management Agency administers the federal crop insurance program through FCIC. For buyup crop insurance FCIC reduced the administrative expense reimbursement from a base rate of 34 percent of the premiums on policies sold from 1988 through 1991 to 31 percent of the premiums from 1994 through 1996. These costs potentially aided the companies in vying for market share and meant that one larger company rather than several smaller companies was delivering crop insurance to farmers. However the remaining 2.6 millionwhich the company was paying each year for access to the former competitors policyholder baseprovided no benefit to the farmer and no net value to the crop insurance program. Furthermore we found that some companies included as administrative expenses for selling and servicing crop insurance expenses that resulted from decisions to distribute profits to 1 company executives and employees through bonuses or 2 parent companies through management fees. We recognized management fees as a reasonable program expense to the extent that companies could identify tangible benefits received from parent companies. Of these 4 percentage points 2 points reflect companies reported expenses that were less than their reimbursement the remainder reflect adjustments to their reported expenses that did not appear to be reasonably associated with the sale and service of crop insurance. In addition we found a number of expenses reported by the companies that although associated with the sale and service of crop insurance seemed to be excessive for a taxpayersupported program. On average the nine companies in our review paid agents sales commissions of 16 percent of buyup premiums they sold in 1994 and 16.2 percent in 1995. For example we found that one company in our sample for 1994 reported expenses of 8391 to send six company managers four accompanied by their spouses to a 3day meeting at a resort location. Our sample for 1995 included a 31483 billing from the same resort for lodging and other costs associated with a company retreat costing 46857 in total. With respect to the first componentbasic sales and service delivery coststhe cost to the government was higher in 1995 when provided through USDA. The administrative expense reimbursement paid to the companies amounted to about 73 per crop policy and USDAs support costs amounted to about 10 per crop policy for a total basic delivery cost to the government for company delivery of about 83 per crop policy. The insurance companies can earn underwriting gains in exchange for taking responsibility for any claims resulting from those policies for which the companies retain risk. Capping the expense reimbursement at around 1500 per policy for example would result in a potential savings of about 74 million while affecting less than 10 percent of the individual policies written in 1995. Under the current reimbursement arrangement as policy premiums increase the companies reimbursement from FCIC for administering the policies increases. As we discuss in more detail in our report while these and other alternative reimbursement methods could result in lower cost reimbursements to insurance companies some methods may increase FCICs own administrative expenses for reporting and compliance.

Based on our review we found that two STRATCOM and NORTHCOMof the four combatant commands we visited had uploaded supporting documentation as required by the Execution Management System guidance for fiscal years 201316. The fourth combatant command PACOM did not upload supporting documentation for fiscal years 2013 2014 and 2015 but began uploading supporting documentation in August 2016 for fiscal year 2016 after we informed an official in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness that the command had not been uploading supporting documentation in accordance with the Execution Management System guidance. However when we attempted to link the sum of individual expenditures reported in uploaded supporting documentation to total expenditures data entered into the Execution Management System by combatant command officials we were unable to do so for three of the four combatant commands we visited. Nonetheless the inability to reconcile supporting documentation with the expenditures entered in the Execution Management System undermines the quality of the data in the system and inhibits DOD decision makers particularly those in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness from providing adequate oversight of how funds are being expended in support of the Joint Exercise Program goals. JTIMS is the system of record for executing the Joint Exercise Program and the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff officials developed a user guide intended to help bring more standardization to the system thereby making the information more useful to other combatant commands.

While nearly all principals responded that they used multiple improvement strategies there were statistically significant differences in principals responses across a range of school characteristics including percentage of the schools students receiving free or reduced price lunch poverty percentage of minority students the schools location and AYP status. Likewise when comparing schools across minority levels we found that principals at high and moderateminority schools were approximately two to three times more likely than principals at lowminority schools to make six particular school improvement strategies a major or moderate focus of their school improvement efforts. The RAND survey of elementary and middle school math teachers in California Georgia and Pennsylvania showed that in each of the three states at least half of the teachers reported increasing their use of certain instructional practices in at least five areas as a result of the statewide math test see fig. Similar to what our poverty analysis showed survey responses provided some evidence that math teachers in highminority schools were more likely than those in lowminority schools to change their instructional practices. Specifically some studies reported changes by teachers who facilitated their students developing higherorder thinking skills such as interpreting meaning understanding implied reasoning and developing conceptual knowledge through practices such as multiple answer problem solving less lecture and more small group work. However some studies indicated that teachers practices did not always reflect the principles of standardsbased instruction and that current accountability policies help contribute to the difficulty in aligning practice with standards. As one synthesis concluded assessments can influence whether teachers broaden or narrow the curriculum focus on concepts and problem solvingor emphasize test preparation over subject matter content. We recently reported that states have most often chosen multiple choice items over other item types of assessments because they are cost effective and can be scored within tight time frames. A few researchers also noted that conducting research in a way that would yield more conclusive results is difficult. An important corollary to the teacher practice of guiding students versus directing them is effective classroom discussion. Some researchers have raised concerns about the quality and intensity of professional development currently received by many teachers nationwide. Specifically the department commented that we 1 did not provide the specific research citations throughout the report for each of our findings or clearly explain how we selected our studies 2 mixed the opinions of education experts with our findings gleaned from the review of the literature 3 did not present data on the extent to which test formats had changed or on the relationship between test format and teaching practices when discussing our assessment findings and 4 did not provide complete information from an Education survey regarding increases and decreases in instructional time. The experts we interviewed whose names and affiliations are listed in appendix III are prominent researchers who conduct review and reflect on the current research in the field and whose work is included in some of the studies we reviewed including the two literature syntheses written by the Department of Education and used by us in this study. Educations State and Local Implementation of the No Child Left Behind Act Volume III Accountability Under NCLB Interim Report included information about the strategies emphasized by principals as a whole and we obtained from Education the NLSNCLB database to determine the extent to which principals responses differed by school characteristic variables. As part of our analyses for both surveys we reviewed documentation and performed electronic testing of the data obtained through the surveys. We reviewed existing literature to determine what researchers have found regarding the effect of standardsbased accountability systems on instructional practices and practices that work in raising student achievement. To assess the methodological quality of the selected studies we developed a data collection instrument to obtain information systematically about each study being evaluated and about the features of the evaluation methodology.", "Four of the 11 national data collection efforts focused solely on incidencethe number of separate times a crime is committed against individuals during a specific time periodrather than prevalencethe unique number of individuals who were victimized during a specific time period. These initiatives are consistent with our recommendation that the Attorney General and Secretary of Health and Human Services determine the extent to which initiatives being planned or underway can be designed or modified to address existing information gaps. For example DOJs Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention OJJDP in collaboration with CDC sponsored a nationwide survey of the incidence and prevalence of childrens ages 17 and younger exposure to violence across several major crime categories including witnessing domestic violence and peer victimization which includes teen dating violence. CDC is currently reviewing the results from the panel and plans to hold a second panel in 2012 consisting of practitioners to review the first panels results and to obtain consensus on the revised definitions. Moreover HHS reported that it is also encouraging the use of uniform definitions by implementing the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey. The national data collection efforts we reviewed as part of our November 2006 report also could not provide a basis for combining the results to compute valid and reliable nationwide prevalence estimates because the efforts had varying scopes in terms of the incidents and categories of victims that were included. We reported in July 2007 that recipients of 11 grant programs we reviewed collected and reported data to the respective agencies on the types of services they provide such as counseling the total number of victims served and in some cases demographic information such as the age of victims however data were not available on the extent to which men women youth and children receive each type of service for all services. The authorizing statutes for the 11 grant programs we reviewed have different purposes therefore the reporting requirements for the 11 grant programs must vary to be consistent with these statutes. Furthermore HHS and DOJ reported that some grant recipients do not have sophisticated data collection systems in place to allow them to collect additional information. Having better and more complete data on the prevalence of domestic violence sexual assault dating violence and stalking as well as related services provided to victims of these crimes can without doubt better inform and shape the federal programs intended to meet the needs of these victims.

As of September 30 1997 the value of loans outstanding on the property improvement program totaled about 4.4 billion on 364423 loans. FHA is responsible for approving lenders monitoring their operations and reviewing the claims submitted for defaulted loans. While lenders are required to report much of this information to their respective regulatory agencies by the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act HUD collects little of this information when Title I loans are made. Therefore HUD would have difficulty determining if some borrowers are obtaining multiple Title I loans or if some borrowers are exceeding the maximum amount of Title I loans per property when loans are made. Our examination of 16556 claims paid by HUD between January 1994 and August 1997 revealed 247 instances in which the same Social Security number appeared on multiple claims. Considering the miscoding on identifying loans as dealer or direct we question HUDs ability to identify default experience by loan type. HUD recently made changes to its claims database system to identify the reasons claims are denied. Program officials agreed that such information is important in determining how well program regulations are being complied with and in targeting lenders for quality assurance reviews. When making Title I loans lenders are required to ensure that borrowers represent acceptable credit risks with a reasonable ability to make payments on the loans and to see that the property improvement work is completed. Lastly for 33 loans on which program regulations required that an inspection be conducted by the lender 18 loan files did not contain the report. However for four of these loans information in the files indicated that the borrowers may not have had sufficient income to qualify for the loan or had poor credit. The pay stub showed that the borrowers yeartodate earnings were 6700 by the middle of March and this amount was used to calculate that his annual income was 34000 or about 2800 per month. However HUD denied the original claim because its underwriting standards had not been followed in that the borrower had poor credit at the time the loan was made. As noted previously between fiscal years 1995 and 1997 HUD performed 33 Title I onsite quality assurance reviews of lenders. These weaknesses center on the absence of information needed to manage the program and HUDs oversight of lenders compliance with program regulations.

For example in support of DLAs goal of reducing its role as a provider and manager of materiel and increasing its role as a manager of supply chain relationships BSM is to help link customers with appropriate suppliers and to incorporate commercial business practices regarding physical distribution and financial management. In order to have the capabilities to effectively manage IT investments an agency should 1 have basic projectlevel control and selection practices in place and 2 manage its projects as a portfolio of investments treating them as an integrated package of competing investment options and pursuing those that best meet the strategic goals objectives and mission of the agency. According to ITIM critical processes at stage 2 include 1 defining investment board operations 2 collecting information about existing investments 3 developing projectlevel investment control processes 4 identifying the business needs for each IT project and 5 developing a basic process for selecting new IT proposals. However DLA has not executed several crucial stage 2 investment practices. This inventory which can take many forms should at a minimum identify the organizations IT projects including new and existing systems and a defined set of relevant investment management information about them for example purpose owner lifecycle stage budget cost physical location and interfaces with other systems. Defining business needs for each IT project helps ensure that projects support the organizations mission goals and meets users needs. The complete list of key practices is provided in table 6. An IT investment portfolio is an integrated enterprisewide collection of investments that are assessed and managed collectively based on common criteria. In implementing the plan it is important that DLA measure and report progress against planned commitments and that appropriate corrective action be taken to address deviations. As a result DLA currently finds itself without some of the capabilities that it needs to ensure that its mix of IT investments best meets the agencys mission and business priorities. To strengthen DLAs investment management capability and address the weaknesses discussed in this report we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the DLA director to designate the development and implementation of effective IT investment management processes as an agencywide priority.

In our recent report we recommended that the Deputy Director for Management at OMB who is responsible for submitting the annual report include comprehensive data on the timeliness of the personnel security clearance process in future versions of the IRTPArequired annual report to Congress. The executive branchs 2006 through 2009 IRTPArequired reports to Congress on the clearance process provided congressional decision makers with little information on qualitya measure that could include topics such as the completeness of the clearance documentation of clearance decisions. In oral comments OMB concurred with our recommendation and emphasized the importance of providing Congress more transparency about quality in the clearance process. Without longterm funding requirements decision makers in both the executive and legislative branches will lack important information for comparing and prioritizing proposals for reforming the clearance processes. In our May 2009 report we recommended that OMBs Deputy Director of Management in the capacity as Chair of the Performance Accountability Council ensure that the appropriate entitiessuch as the Performance Accountability Council its subcommittees or the Joint Reform Team establish a strategic framework for the joint reform effort to include 1 a mission statement and strategic goals 2 outcomefocused performance measures to continually evaluate the progress of the reform effort toward meeting its goals and addressing longstanding problems with the security clearance process 3 a formal comprehensive communication strategy that includes consistency of message and encourages twoway communication between the Performance Accountability Council and key stakeholders 4 a clear delineation of roles and responsibilities for the implementation of the information technology strategy among all agencies responsible for developing and implementing components of the information technology strategy and 5 longterm funding requirements for security clearance reform including estimates of potential cost savings from the reformed process and provide them to decision makers in Congress and the executive branch.

Pena resulted in the federal government examining how it implemented affirmative action programs including certain procurement preference programs. This lesser evidentiary standard requires that applicants show that they are more likely than not to meet the criteria for social disadvantage. Effective October 1 1998 small business concerns must receive certification from SBA that they qualify as an SDB for purposes of receiving a price evaluation adjustment when competing for a prime contract. Although on September 30 2000 the initial pilot covering civilian agencies authority to use price and evaluation credits expired the administration is seeking a 3year extension of the program as part of SBAs pending Reauthorization Bill. Of the 9034 certified SDBs according to an SBA official 6405 firms or 71 percent were automatically grandfathered into the SDB program due to their 8a certification. As for the remaining 507 complete applications SBA officials also reported that applicants withdrew 307 applications for unknown reasons and 200 were in process meaning they were being reviewed to determine whether or not the applicant met the eligibility criteria. SBA officials and officials from other organizations we interviewed agreed that businesses might not have applied for certification due to uncertainty about when or how the SDB certifications would be implemented. Two officials we interviewed as well as officials from SBA said that some small businesses believe that they are unlikely to receive federal contracts due to both real and perceived restrictions on agencies use of price evaluation adjustments and therefore questioned the value of obtaining SDB certification.

Votebyphone systems use electronic technology to mark paper ballots. Regarding accessible voting system operation HAVA specifies that the voting system must be accessible for people with disabilities in a manner that provides the same opportunity for access and participation as is provided for other voters. In addition to curbside voting officials we interviewed at most polling places said they would provide assistance to help people with disabilities vote in the polling place. Fifty percent of polling places had one or more potential impediments in the path from the parking area to the building entrance see fig. Fortythree states reported on our survey that they required accessibility standards for polling places in 2008 up from 23 states in 2000. Additionally most states reported that they used federal HAVA funds to improve the physical accessibility of polling places. To help facilitate voting for people with disabilities most states have established standards by which to evaluate the accessibility of polling places and have required inspections of polling places to help ensure accessibility. Justice provided guidance on polling place accessibility and conducted an initial assessment of states compliance with HAVAs January 2006 deadline for accessible voting systems. In 2004 Justice published the Americans with Disabilities Act ADA Checklist for Polling Places which provided information to voting officials on key accessibility features needed by most voters with disabilities to go from the parking area to the voting area. Justice followed up with letters in 2005 and 2006 which outlined HAVA voting system requirements and asked states to respond to a series of questions to help gauge whether every polling place in the state had at least one accessible voting machine and whether poll workers were trained in the machines operation. Furthermore in close to half of polling places the accessible voting system itself could pose challenges for voters with disabilities to vote privately or independently. In some cases states or counties placed restrictions on our visits to polling places. Therefore the percentage of polling places cited as having one or more potential impediments was based on whether a polling place was found to have at least one feature that might impede access to voting in any of the four locations we examined and does not include potential impediments associated with the voting area itself. We identified the types of voting methods available to voters with and without disabilities and took measurements of the voting station or table used by people with disabilities to determine whether wheelchairs could fit inside the station or under the table and whether equipment was within reach for wheelchair users.

For comparison the total amount of undisbursed balances in expired grant accounts in PMS is more than 200 million less than the amount we previously reported for calendar year 2006 while the overall amount of grant disbursements through PMS increased by about 23 percent during this time from 320 billion in fiscal year 2006 to 415 billion in fiscal year 2011. These expired grant accounts had a combined total of roughly 316 million in undisbursed balances or 40 percent of the total undisbursed funding in expired grant accounts as of September 30 2011 see fig. From fiscal year 2006 to fiscal year 2011 the HHS independent auditor routinely reported on concerns with management controls over grant closeout including a backlog of HHS grant accounts in PMS that were already beyond what the auditor considered a reasonable time frame for closeout. PSC which operates PMS does not close out a grant account in PMS until instructed to by the awarding agency and continues to charge service fees to the awarding agencies. If the grant has otherwise been administratively and financially closed out then agencies paying fees for expired accounts with zero dollar balance are paying for services that are not needed instead of providing services to grant recipients. Currently accounts with undisbursed balances are included in dormant account reports if 1 the grantee has not drawn down funds for 2 years or more and 2 the awarding agency has made no changes to the authorized amount of funding available to the grantee in 2 years or more. While they focused on expired grants in specific offices or grant programs when taken together these report findings indicate that the timely closeout of grants continues to be an issue for multiple programs and grantmaking agencies across the federal government. Survey respondents noted that awarding agencies often inadequately monitor grantee activities by among other things not properly closing out grants in a timely manner. In our report expired grant accounts were defined as the grants that remained open after the end of the grant period and were eligible for closeout. A11 in defining expired grant accounts as including budget authority that is no longer available for new obligations but is still available for disbursement. Similarly officials from DOJ and NASA also confirmed to us that the number they reported in their 2010 performance reports represented balances in expired appropriations accounts and not the amount of funding that remained in grant accounts eligible for close out. Instruct agencies with undisbursed balances still obligated to grants several years past their grant end date to develop and implement strategies to quickly and efficiently take action to close out these grants and return unspent funds to the Treasury when appropriate. Federal payment systems facilitate the transfer of cash payments from federal awarding agencies to grantees. Namely to determine the amount of undisbursed balances in expired grant accounts we analyzed PMS data from closeout reports PSC makes available to PMS customers each quarter.

While most companies pay their agents a commission to sell and service crop insurance policies some companies pay agents a salary. As a wholly owned subsidiary of Acceptance American Growers was primarily responsible for selling and servicing federal crop insurance policies and shared the same general management as the parent organization. In 2001 American Growers attempted to expand its share of the crop insurance market by purchasing assets from another company including that companys book of crop insurance business. Because American Growers was unable to achieve the operational efficiencies it had anticipated this acquisition resulted in additional operating costs and expenses that were higher than the reimbursement that RMA provided companies to cover the sale and service of crop insurance. The SRA between RMA and participating crop insurance companies establishes the terms and conditions under which RMA will provide subsidy and reinsurance on crop insurance policies sold or reinsured by insurance companies. One reason RMA was unable to identify deficiencies in American Growers finances was because following the agencys emphasis on companies compliance with program criteria RMA only reviewed a companys historical financial information and its ability to pay claims on the basis of the companys past surplus and its private reinsurance agreements. According to several state regulators RMA did not routinely share information or otherwise coordinate with state regulators to determine the financial health of a company. According to another state regulator RMA and the state have talked when a company was introducing a new crop insurance product however the regulator could not remember sharing information with RMA about the financial operations of companies participating in the federal crop insurance program. RMA worked with NDOI to keep American Growers in rehabilitation rather than liquidate the company because RMA was concerned that if NDOI chose to liquidate the company RMA may not have a mechanism to expeditiously pay claims and transfer American Growers policies to other insurance providers. RMA was concerned that if American Growers was liquidated policyholders would not be paid for their losses and their coverage would lapse making them ineligible for continued crop insurance coverage. Reviewing the causes underlying American Growers failure and RMAs actions provides a valuable opportunity to identify shortcomings in the financial oversight of companies participating in the federal crop insurance program and reforms necessary to strengthen RMAs oversight and RMAs ability to respond to an insurance provider insolvency. To improve RMAs financial oversight of companies participating in the federal crop insurance program and its ability to effectively address future insolvencies we recommend that the Secretary of Agriculture direct RMA to take the following three actions 1 Develop written policies to improve financial and operational reviews used to monitor the financial condition of companies to include analyses of projected expenses projected underwriting gains relevant financial operations of holding companies and financial data on planned acquisitions. In 1999 when the company extended CRC Plus to rice a crop with which American Growers had limited actuarial experience the company mistakenly priced the product too low. In an effort to increase its market share by recruiting more agents to sell crop insurance American Growers paid higher agent commissions than other companies participating in the program. Overall American Growers expenses as a percentage of premium sold were about 11 percent higher than the average expenses of the other companies. According to RMA Rain and Hails intention was to not accept past liabilities regarding disputed claims compliance issues litigation or regulatory issues associated with American Growers policies and ultimately to acquire only about onethird of American Growers business. Finally RMA was concerned that some agents may have deducted their commissions from policyholder premiums which could have made it more difficult for RMA to determine which policyholders had paid the premiums on their policies.", "Under Title I of ERISA EBSA conducts investigations of plans and seeks appropriate remedies to correct violations of the law including litigation when necessary. In addition some pension plans use investment managers to oversee plan assets and these managers may be subject to other securities laws. EBSA allows its regions the flexibility to tailor their investigations to address the unique issues in their regions within a framework established by EBSAs Office of Enforcement. The regions also process applications for the Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program VFCP through which plan officials can voluntarily report and correct some violations without penalty. Investigative staff also have some responsibility for selecting cases. Currently EBSAs national priorities involve among other things investigating defined contribution pension plan and health plan fraud. EBSAs education program for plan participants aims to increase their knowledge of their rights and benefits under ERISA. The agency also conducts outreach to plan sponsors and service providers about their ongoing fiduciary responsibilities and obligations under ERISA. EBSAs regional offices also assist in implementing national education initiatives and conduct their own outreach to address local concerns. EBSA has taken steps to address many of the recommendations we have made over a number of years to improve its enforcement program including assessing the level and types of noncompliance with ERISA improving sharing of best investigative practices and developing a human capital strategy to better respond changes in its workforce. EBSA has reported a substantial increase in results from its enforcement efforts since our last review. We recently reported that the lack of timely and complete of Form 5500 data affects EBSAs use of the information for enforcement purposes such as computer targeting and identifying troubled plans. EBSA receives processed Form 5500 information on individual filings on a regular basis once a form is completely processed. We recommended that the Congress amend ERISA to require fullscope audits of employee benefit plans and to require plan administrators and independent public accountants to report on how effective an employee benefit plans internal controls are in protecting plan assets. Given the restrictive legal requirements that have limited the use of penalties for violations of ERISAs fiduciary requirements we recommended that Congress consider amending ERISA to give the Secretary of Labor additional authority with respect to assessing monetary penalties against fiduciaries. Separate from SEC activities EBSA began investigating possible fiduciary violations at some large investment companies including those that sponsor mutual funds and violations by plan fiduciaries. Given the everchanging complexities of employee benefit plans and how rapidly the financial condition of pension plans can deteriorate it is imperative that policymakers regulators plan participants and others have more timely and accurate Form 5500 information. For example because of restrictive legal requirements EBSA continues to be hindered in assessing penalties against fiduciaries or others who knowingly participate in a fiduciary breach.", "Some parties have pointed out that there was a possibility that implementation of the ORBIT Act could have given rise to action arguably inconsistent with commitments that the United States made in international trade agreements. Both Intelsat Ltd. and Intelsat LLC are incorporated in countries that are signatories to the WTO and have laws that secure competition in telecommunications services. In December 2003 FCC noted that if Intelsat Ltd. did not conduct an IPO by the statutory deadline the agency would limit or deny Intelsat LLCs applications or requests and revoke the previous authorizations granting Intelsat LLC the authority to provide satellite services in the United States. On August 16 2004 Intelsat Ltd. announced that its Board of Directors approved the sale of the company to a consortium of four private investors the sale requires the approval of shareholders holding 60 percent of Intelsats outstanding shares and also regulatory approval. In particular the ORBIT Act set requirements for INTELSATs privatization that if not met could have triggered FCCs denial of licenses that would allow a successor private company to INTELSAT to provide services in the United States once that company was incorporated under foreign law. Finally several stakeholders noted that the act had the effect of complementing international trade agreements by seeking to further open and liberalize trade in international satellite communications services. According to most stakeholders and experts we spoke with access to non U.S. satellite markets has generally improved during the past decade. In particular global satellite companies appear less likely now than they were in the past to encounter government restraints or business practices that limit their ability to provide service in nonU.S. satellite markets. Some satellite companies have stated that some market access problems still exist which they attribute to foreign government policies that limit or slow entry. markets in either their annual review of compliance with telecommunications trade agreements or in comments solicited in the context of ongoing WTO services negotiations. For approximately 30 years INTELSAT was the dominant provider of global satellite services. Several stakeholders noted that Intelsat may benefit from the longterm business relationships that were forged over the decades since telecommunications companies in many countries will feel comfortable continuing to do business with Intelsat as they have for years. However some other companies have a different view on whether Intelsat has any preferential or exclusive market access advantages. Some of the companies we spoke with believe that FCC should take a more proactive role in improving access for satellite companies in nonU.S. Even the satellite companies that complained to FCC in the context of Intelsats licensing proceedings told us that they had not made any formal complaints of ORBIT Act violations or asked FCC to initiate a proceeding on the matter. NTIA also provided technical comments that were incorporated into the report as appropriate and also sent formal comments in a letter which appears in appendix II. SES Americom provided both technical commentswhich we addressed as appropriate and substantive comments that expressed concerns about our characterization of some of the issues discussed in this report.", "I provides an overview of the military services prepositioned assets and their locations. Corrosion can also reduce the safety of equipment items. Temporary shelters may be a feasible option to address immediate storage needs. The primary measure to reduce corrosion of Army and Marine Corps prepositioned assets has been the use of humiditycontrolled storage facilities. At Camp Carroll in South Korea about 30 percent of the Armys Heavy Brigade Combat Team equipmentmostly sustainment stockis stored outdoors in an often damp and humid region. In South Korea and Kuwait Army officials said that even with the additional planned storage facilities substantial amounts of equipment will still be stored outdoors. According to Army storage and maintenance guidelines storage of equipment in facilities without humidity controlparticularly in open storage without protectionnot only invites greater and more rapid deterioration because of corrosion but requires increased surveillance inspections and maintenance. The military services have made prior use of temporary shelters in several locations for both prepositioned and non prepositioned equipment. Corrosionrelated data that could enhance efforts to prevent and mitigate corrosion of prepositioned assets is unavailable because the Army and Marine Corps consider collection of this information to be a low priority and consequently do not systematically collect it. Although Army guidance for documenting equipment maintenance includes detailed instructions for reporting corrosion issues Army officials said most of those responsible for documenting the maintenance action do not want to take the extra time to include corrosion information because they see it as having minimal value and have no incentive to collect it. Although the Army and Marine Corps are not collecting data about the current costs to prevent and mitigate corrosion of prepositioned assets the military services have estimated that at least 25 percent of overall maintenance costs are corrosion related and that as much as onethird of these costs could be reduced through more effective corrosion prevention and mitigation. The additional information that would be obtained through the collection of corrosion data could support the Armys and Marine Corps efforts to more effectively prevent and mitigate corrosion and achieve longterm cost savings which could be significant given the resources the military services devote each year to addressing corrosionrelated problems. Corrosion prevention measures may reduce the amount of maintenance needed thereby extending the availability of equipment items over their life cycle. Furthermore while the Army and Marine Corps do not collect corrosion data for prepositioned equipment the collection of such data could provide additional information to identify the underlying causes of maintenance problems and develop solutions to address these problems. Until the Army and Marine Corps take additional actions to prevent corrosion such as implementing use of temporary shelters to the greatest extent feasible and collecting corrosionrelated data prepositioned equipment stored outdoors will continue to corrode at an accelerated pace and the services will continue to incur unnecessary costs for maintaining equipment and repairing corrosion damage. To assess the availability of corrosionrelated data to the Army and Marine Corps to support corrosion prevention and mitigation efforts for prepositioned assets we met with DOD and service command officials responsible for managing and maintaining prepositioned assets and obtained and reviewed DOD and military service policies and procedures for collecting and reporting maintenance costs and related equipment material condition information. The Marine Corps also prepositions equipment and supplies aboard prepositioning ships and at land sites in Norway. The military services store these stocks of equipment and supplies at several land sites and aboard prepositioning ships around the world.", "Federal and state policymakers have used a variety of policies to encourage deployment of solar systems advanced meters and other residential electricity storage and management technologies. Net metering policies implemented by state regulators generally require electricity suppliers to offer net metering programs that credit customers for the electricity they send to the grid from their solar or other distributed generation system. Specifically our analysis of EIA data indicated that the deployment of residential solar systems has increased significantly in some states but residential solar systems account for a small portion of nationwide electricity generation. Solar systems produce savings for customers when the cost of the electricity that the systems generate is lower than the cost of electricity that customers would otherwise have purchased from the grid. Grid operators widely deployed advanced meters among residential customers in some states from 2007 through 2015 according to EIA data. Technologies that enable customers to store electricity and manage their electricity consumption could help improve the efficiency of grid operations among other benefits according to reports we reviewed and stakeholders we interviewed. According to several reports we reviewed the lack of grid operators control over solar systems output can present challenges to these operators and result in additional costs if solar systems locations and electricity output do not align with grid conditions. According to several reports we reviewed from multiple sources the greater use of residential storage and electricity management technologiesparticularly storage systems in combination with significantly expanded deployment of solar systems could lead to a cycle of reduced electricity consumption declining supplier revenues and increasing electricity prices potentially creating longterm financial challenges for electricity suppliers. For example timebased pricesprices that vary throughout the day with demandcan be used to encourage customers to manage their electricity consumption in a way that aligns with conditions on the grid. Our objectives were to describe 1 key federal and state policies used to encourage the deployment of these technologies 2 the extent to which these technologies are being deployed and 3 the benefits and challenges of deploying these technologies. We identified relevant reports by conducting database and web searches and through suggestions from the stakeholders we interviewed. We identified additional stakeholders representing multistate perspectives through our research using our past work and by considering suggestions from other stakeholders.", "In addition FEMA provided potentially improper andor fraudulent rental assistance payments to individuals living in FEMAprovided apartments. For example FEMA made nearly 46000 in rental assistance payments to at least 10 individuals living in apartments at the same time that the apartments were being paid for by FEMA through the city of Plano Texas. We previously reported that inadequate preventive controls related to the IHP application process resulted in an estimated 1 billion of potentially improper andor fraudulent payments through February 2006. FEMA concurred with all recommendations and responded that it had taken or is in the process of taking actions to implement these recommendations. With respect to property bought with government purchase cards FEMAs inability to find items 1 year after they were purchased including laptop computers printers and GPS units shows that FEMA property accountability controls are ineffective and possibly resulted in the loss or theft of government property. We have previously provided 25 recommendations to DHS and FEMA to improve management of IHP and the purchase card program. With respect to duplicate assistance payments across multiple disasters FEMA should implement andor enable controls to prevent duplicate payments to the same individual from different disasters for the same damage done to the same address. To prevent improper payments to nonqualified aliens FEMA should provide clear guidance and training to FEMA and contractor employees on the specific types of aliens eligible for financial disaster assistance and identify nonqualified aliens and develop processes to identify and deny assistance to nonqualified aliens who register for IHP assistance using valid Social Security numbers through data comparisons with agencies that maintain data on legal aliens with Social Security numbers. However in its responses to our recommendations concerning actions to prevent duplicate housing assistance and housing damage repair assistance FEMA also stated it planned to perform additional investigations to confirm that the conditions described in our draft report are in fact representative of systemic problems before initiating appropriate corrective actions. Those payments were excluded from the analysis because FEMA failed to maintain detailed reliable data on individuals living in FEMAprovided apartments.

Accordingly we recommended that Labor 1 perform a comprehensive analysis of lessons learned and 2 distribute the analysis to each state through an informationsharing platform or repository such as a website. Many of the challenges pertain to inconsistent funding a lack of sufficient staff with adequate expertise and in some cases the difficulty of effective interstate collaboration.

The bank failed to maintain an effective antimoneylaundering program and report suspicious transactions in 2008 which contributed to their customers losing about 5.4 billion in Bernard Madoffs Ponzi scheme. 3. Depending on which agency seizes the assets forfeitures are generally deposited into two accounts either DOJs AFF or Treasurys TFF. Funds from the AFF and TFF are primarily used for program expenses payments to third partiesincluding the victims of the related crimesand equitable sharing payments to law enforcement agencies that participated in the efforts resulting in forfeitures. Once Treasurys BFS receives payments for FinCEN and OFACassessed penalties BFS staff deposits the payments into the appropriate Treasury General Fund accounts. When enforcement orders are executed financial institutions send all related documentation the stipulation for penalty payment the order and the check in the amount of the penalty payment to FDICs applicable regional office Legal Division staff which in turn sends the documentation to Legal Division staff in Washington D.C. Specifically we analyzed publicly available data from January 2009 through December 2015 on penalties assessed against financial institutions by the Federal Reserve FDIC OCC SEC and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network FinCEN a bureau within Treasury for violations of BSAAML requirements. We also reviewed relevant GAO and Office of Inspector General reports and laws governing the various accounts.", "H.R. Based upon our recommendation the executive branch has made progress in implementing our recommendations that threat and risk assessments be done to improve federal efforts to combat terrorism. In our April 2000 testimony we observed that federal programs addressing terrorism appear in many cases to be overlapping and uncoordinated. The new council would also make recommendations to the heads of federal agencies regarding their programs.

The contractor responsible for implementing USAIDs alternative development programs told us USAID does not monitor the necessary indicators and therefore cannot determine the extent to which projects are contributing to reducing coca cultivation or increasing stability. Defense State ONDCP and USAID provided written comments which are reproduced in appendixes IV through VII.

Although the proposal tasks the new department with coordinating the federal governments civilian efforts only the new department also would need to coordinate with DOD because DOD conducts biomedical research and development efforts designed to detect and respond to weapons of mass destruction. These programs now primarily sponsored by NIH include a variety of efforts to understand basic biological mechanisms of infection and to develop and test rapid diagnostic tools vaccines and antibacterial and antiviral drugs. The mission of the select agent program is aligned with the new department and therefore the transfer of the program would enhance efficiency and accountability. Although there is a need to coordinate these activities with the other homeland security preparedness and response programs that would be brought into the new department there is also a need to maintain the priorities for current dualpurpose biomedical research.

The declining investment in the later years is the result of the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle EELV program no longer being considered a major acquisition program and the cancellation and proposed cancellation of two development efforts which would have significantly increased DODs major space acquisition investment. The Global Positioning System GPS IIF satellite is now expected to be delayed almost 3 years from its original date to November 2009. Further while the Air Force is structuring the new GPS IIIA program to prevent mistakes made on the IIF program the Air Force is aiming to deploy the GPS IIIA satellites 3 years faster than the IIF satellites. For example DOD faces a potential gap in protected military communications caused by delays in the AEHF program and the proposed cancellation of the TSAT program which itself posed risks in schedule delays because of TSATs complexity and funding cuts designed to ensure technology objectives were achievable. There may also be opportunities to continue production of older generation satellites but such efforts also require time and money that may not be readily available and may face other challenges such as restarting production lines and addressing issues related to obsolete parts and materials. First on a broad scale DOD starts more weapon programs than it can afford creating a competition for funding that encourages low cost estimating optimistic scheduling overpromising suppressing bad news and for space programs forsaking the opportunity to identify and assess potentially more executable alternatives. The resulting erosion of DODs capability to lead and manage the space acquisition process magnified problems related to requirements creep and poor contractor performance. In the view of DOD and industry officials we have interviewed this condition has enabled contractors to hold some programs hostage and has made it difficult to inject competition into space programs. A number of studies have found that both industry and the U.S. government face substantial shortages of scientists and engineers and that recruitment of new personnel is difficult because the space industry is one of many sectors competing for the limited number of trained scientists and engineers. Although these actions are a step in the right direction additional leadership and support are still needed to ensure that reforms that DOD has begun will take hold. We have also identified practices related to cost estimating program manager tenure quality assurance technology transition and an array of other aspects of acquisition program management that space programs could benefit from. For example as part of its strategy for enhancing the roles of program managers in major weapon system acquisitions the department has established a policy that requires formal agreements among program managers their acquisition executives and the user community that set forth common program goals. Correspondingly DODs Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition Technology and Logistics is asking space programs passing through milestone reviews to take specific measures to better hold contractors accountable through award and incentive fees to require independent technology readiness assessments at particular points in the acquisition process and to hold requirements stable. Furthermore the Air Force U.S. Strategic Command and other key organizations have made progress in implementing the Operationally Responsive Space ORS initiative. Last week the House Committee on Armed Services announced it would be introducing a bill to similarly reform DODs system for acquiring weapons by providing for among other things oversight early in product development and for appointment of independent officials to review acquisition programs. The GPS IIIA program for example began 9 months later than originally anticipated because of funding delays but the delivery date remained the same. We relied on our best practices studies which comment on the persistent problems affecting space acquisitions the actions DOD has been taking to address these problems and what remains to be done.", "Treasurys Office of Homeownership Preservation within the Office of Financial Stability OFS which administers TARP addresses the issues of preventing avoidable foreclosures and preserving homeownership. In contrast HAMP Tier 2 is available for either owneroccupied properties or rental properties and borrowers monthly mortgage payments prior to modification do not have to exceed a specified threshold. As it does with PRA Treasury provides incentive payments to the secondlien mortgage holders in the form of a percentage of each dollar of principal reduction on the second lien. However some servicers also indicated that HAMP Tier 2 might not reach many additional borrowers because the HAMP modifications would likely offset proprietary modifications that would have otherwise been made to those borrowers loans. Specifically about 15 percent of its mortgage holdersinvestors had opted out of PRA but had told this servicer that they might be willing to reconsider in response to the increased incentives especially for loans that would qualify for the highest incentive on the principal reduction LTVs greater than or equal to 105 percent but less than 115 percent. Given the currently low participation rates and the reasons for them as well as the mixed expectations of the servicers we interviewed it is not yet possible to determine whether the changes will significantly increase the number of troubled borrowers assisted under MHA. Previously Treasury officials had acknowledged that servicers might face some challenges as they did when they implemented the enterprises standard modification. In addition Treasury raised the allowable DTI floor to 25 percent above the allowable DTI floor of 10 percent for the enterprises standard modification to help ensure that borrowers who received HAMP Tier 2 modifications were really in need of assistance. In either case the borrowers ability to remain current in either the trial modification or more importantly the permanent modification could be compromised risking redefault. As we reported previously Treasury must establish specific and relevant performance measures that will enable it to evaluate a programs success against stated goals in order to hold itself and servicers accountable for these TARPfunded programs. In addition although the states had estimated that they would assist more than 450000 borrowers by the end of the program Treasurys projections indicated that using the monthly rate of borrowers approved during the first quarter of 2012 the states would assist fewer than 350000. States are also challenged to make sure they have the right number of personnel to administer the program. In general the states we spoke to said that servicer participation had been a significant issue initially but that most servicers were now participating in the mortgage payment assistance and reinstatement programs. Several states mentioned ongoing implementation challenges in particular in the area of exchanging information with servicers. Finally state officials told us that they tracked the reasons borrowers who were reached did not qualify for Hardest Hit Fund programs an effort that helped them identify borrowers in need of assistance who were ineligible for it because they did not meet certain requirements. However having states report this information to Treasury in a consistent format could provide greater insight into states progress in implementing the Hardest Hit Fund and inform Treasurys oversight and monitoring decisions. Treasury has established performance measures to assess servicers compliance with MHA program requirements and identified certain risks associated with the recent changes but it has not provided meaningful performance goals or comprehensive risk assessments for HAMP Tier 2. As part of its efforts to continue improving the transparency and accountability of MHA the Secretary of the Treasury should consider methods for better capturing outcomes for borrowers who are denied or canceled or have redefaulted from HAMP including more accurately reflecting what actions are completed or pending and allowing for the reporting of multiple concurrent outcomes in order to determine whether borrowers are receiving effective assistance outside of HAMP and whether additional actions may be needed to assist them.", "Branch officials said that 14 posts failed to provide documentation that physical inventories were conducted. In addition some Foreign Service nationals responsible for maintaining contracting files indicated that they were not adequately trained. To improve controls over cashiering in 1993 the Committee recommended that State fully fund the implementation of a worldwide standardized and integrated financial management system adopt standardized accounting systems increase monitoring and oversight of overseas cashiering operations improve oversight of U.S. disbursing officers operations to ensure that transactions and accounts are properly recorded and reconciled and require all posts to train staff in safeguards and procedures to prevent theft or misuse of official funds. However State officials said more regional training was needed for the hundreds of Foreign Service nationals supporting States budget and fiscal operations overseas. For example State now emphasizes the importance of management controls and responsibility for those controls to newly appointed ambassadors during preassignment briefings and in the Secretarys Chief of Mission Authority Letter. In addition the risk assessment questionnaire was revised to include questions covering the minimum controls necessary for facilities maintenance contracting and medical reimbursements. The Mission Program Plans for the embassies in Ankara Dhaka and Tunis all incorporated detailed statements of objectives and responsibilities within the administrative section which helped management focus attention on identifying problems and developing corrective action plans. In commenting on a draft of this report State Department officials stated that improving the management of its overseas operations was a high priority and that it would like to see the overseas posts use the practices that we identified as a positive management tool in ways that make sense for their particular circumstances and environments. If the pilot demonstrates the applicability of these improvements in a variety of posts then State should continue to expand the use of these practices until the maximum number of posts benefit. In addition we observed good embassy practices that could be used at other embassies. The Under Secretary instructed mission management to develop a mission program plan that reflects mission priorities in both policy and management areas actively involves all mission elements in its preparation and serves as an instrument for continuous management improvement. The structure of MPP supports a proactive management improvement effort. Program planning officials believe elements of these programs can significantly improve planning efforts at other bureaus. Instead the posts could use and score their own questionnaires for selfassessment purposes during the annual certification process.

While some states had been using nonfederal funds to provide services to youth in these broader age groups the number of states that reported providing core independent living services such as independent living skills assessments daily living skills training and counseling to youth younger than 16 more than doubled after FCIA. All states the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico were allocated funds under the ETV program to assist youth seeking postsecondary education. States differed in the proportion of eligible youth served under their respective independent living programs and officials in the 4 states we visited reported gaps in providing critical services as well as challenges in engaging youth and parents in the services offered. The extent to which these differences were related to whether the states served higher or lower numbers of youth who emancipated from foster care is unknown. HHS has begun to evaluate selected independent living programs and officials reported that the results of this evaluation should be available in 2007. Alternatively ACF officials reported that the Child and Family Services Review used to evaluate the states overall child welfare systems could serve as a tool to monitor independent living programs but the CFSR is limited in the type and amount of data collected on youth receiving independent living services. Many youth in the foster care system need additional services and support throughout and beyond their adolescence to make the transition to self sufficiency. However the ability of ACF to monitor state performance continues to be hindered by an absence of standard comprehensive information within and across state plans on each states goals services and youth outcomes as measured against baselines of past achievement. To improve access to the array of services available to youth transitioning out of foster care and assist states in leveraging available resources HHS should make information available to states and local areas about other federal programs that may assist youth in their transition to self sufficiency and provide guidance on how to access services under these programs. We obtained comments from the Department of Health and Human Services which are reproduced in appendix III. HHS further reported that ACF did provide regional office staff with a checklist to review and approve the first state plan and that in fiscal year 2005 ACF will develop and provide a review protocol to be used in regional office desk reviews of states annual progress reports. Developing a standard reporting format that states can use for their plans and annual reports would help HHS improve the efficiency of the reporting process by clarifying the broad guidance ACF provides to the states allowing ACF reviewers to quickly identify states progress toward meeting program goals and thereby reduce the burden of the reporting process currently in place. To determine the extent to which states expanded independent living services and age groups of foster youth served since the passage of FCIA as well as what challenges remain we surveyed all 50 states the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico through a Webbased questionnaire. In addition to conducting the survey we visited independent living programs in 4 states Texas Florida Washington and Connecticut to obtain more detailed information regarding the provision of independent living services and changes to state independent living programs since the passage of FCIA in 1999.

GAO03397.", "The I129F petition along with any supporting documentation submitted by the petitioner is USCISs primary source for information on petitioners prior I129F petition filings and criminal convictionskey information that the U.S. government is required under IMBRA to obtain and disclose to beneficiaries. When sharing this information with the beneficiaries consular officers must also inform them that the criminal background information is based on available records and may not be complete something the IMBRA pamphlet also notes. Further as we discuss later in this report our review of CLAIMS 3 data indicates that USCIS officers have not consistently followed the I129F SOP which USCIS has modified multiple times since the summer of 2013 to address among other things inaccuracies in the language associated with the application of IMBRA waivers. These officials added that State has an internal website for consular training which includes a reminder for supervisory consular officers that orientation upon arrival and continuing onthejob training at post is vital to develop fully proficient consular officers. Incorporating the FAMs IMBRArelated documentation requirements into States training courses for consular officers could help State better ensure that consular officers are aware of the requirements so that they can be better positioned to more consistently document the disclosure of IMBRA information during interviews with K visa applicants. Under IMBRA DOJ is responsible for pursuing federal civil and criminal penalties outlined in the law for IMBs and petitioners who violate IMBRA provisions and for consulting with DHS and State in investigating and prosecuting such violations. Specifically According to IMBRA and the June 2014 SOP petitioners may be required to request one of three waivers and the waiver requirements are based in part on the number of I129F petitions filed for K1 visas only petitions for K3 visas are not to be included. Specifically of the 227 I129F petitions filed between March 2012 and March 2014 for which officers had indicated that a criminal waiver was required 207 did not meet the criteria requiring a criminal waiver because the petitioner had not filed any previous petitions. USCIS has been revising the I129F petition to address inaccuracies and deficiencies for more than 10 months and has not set a time frame for the planned completion of these changes. Taking steps to ensure that all data to be collected in accordance with IMBRA are included with the release of the electronic I129F petition and providing additional training could help USCIS better ensure that IMBRA requirements are properly implemented and that data on petitions are collected and maintained consistent with USCIS procedures. DHS concurred with our three recommendations to that agency and described actions under way or planned to address them.", "Moreover the latest economic analysis January 2000 was outdated because it did not reflect the programs current status and known problems and risks. That is although the department is planning to acquire and implement SPS as a series of five increments it has not made decisions about whether to invest in each release on the basis of the releases expected return on investment as well as whether prior releases were actually achieving returnoninvestment expectations. Our work has shown that it is difficult to estimate with any degree of accuracy cost and schedule estimates for many increments to be delivered over many years because later increments are not well understood or defined. Similarly CIO officials told us that the department was not validating whether deployed releases of SPS were producing benefits because there was no DOD requirement to do so and no metrics had been defined for such validation. In addition the department found other program management concerns not directly within the scope of our review such as the need to appropriately staff the program management office with sufficient resources and address the current lack of technical expertise in areas such as contracting software engineering testing and configuration management modify the existing contract to recognize that the system does not employ a commercialofftheshelf software product but rather is based on customized software product establish DODcontrolled requirements management and acceptance testing processes and practices that are rigorous and disciplined and assess the continued viability of the existing contractor.

Specifically as a condition of future federal financial assistance communities are required to participate in NFIP and to adopt adequate floodplain ordinances with effective enforcement provisions consistent with federal standards in order to reduce or avoid future flood losses. For example recipients of funds from BIAs Housing Improvement Program HUDs Indian Housing Block Grant IHBG and Indian Community Development Block Grant ICDBG and several USDA Rural Development loan programs are required to purchase flood insurance if an assisted structure is in an SFHA. In some cases although a tribe is not an NFIP participant the tribe may be located in another community that participates in NFIP. Additionally they were concerned that tribes might not grant Representatives of the National Flood Determination permission for FEMA to publish a map if tribal borders were in dispute. Many tribes view affordability as a significant issue for their members in purchasing NFIP policies. Figure 2 shows a Native Alaska fishing village that has experienced flooding but whose residents according to the tribes housing director have not purchased NFIP flood insurance due to the high cost. Likewise representatives of an Oklahoma tribe told us that its lack of participation in NFIP was due in part to a reluctance to face possible sanctions because of the tribes limited ability to enact and enforce ordinances for land owned by non Indians. Without flood hazard maps tribal communities including those that may be in areas with a higher risk of flooding may not be sufficiently aware of their flood risk. USDA Rural Development has a Native American Coordinator who interacts with tribes on programmatic issues including challenges and issues that arise due to flooding. As previously noted officials from HUDs Office of Environment and Energy also told us that they were increasing opportunities for HUD grantees including tribes to obtain information and training on environmental topics such as flood risks. An Arizona tribe we contacted uses AMERIND insurance on its HUD assisted tribal housing and the policies included the flood protection endorsement. Congress created NFIP with the intent of providing affordable flood insurance to communities and households in order to financially protect property owners and reduce the cost of federal postdisaster assistance but participation by Indian tribes has been low. FEMA has provided tribes with training and technical assistance and has to some extent helped tribes to understand the flooding risks they face. We reviewed FEMA data on communities participating in NFIP including those designated as tribal communities and on tribes that had flood hazard maps but were not participating in NFIP for various reasons. We interviewed and gathered documentation from officials at FEMA and other federal agencies with programs that assist Indian tribes such as the Bureau of Indian Affairs BIA within the Department of the Interior Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD and the U.S. Department of Agriculture USDA Rural Development. Further we asked tribal representatives about their interactions with FEMA and other agencies and information or assistance they had received related to NFIP. Participating Based on number of individual NFIP policies held by the tribe size of tribe and geographic diversity a total of eight tribes were selected for inclusion as well as six backup tribes.", "Under the DL program the federal government provides loans to students and their families using federal capital. Generally lenders provide the FFEL loan proceeds to a students school which then credits the students account and disburses the residual amount if any to the student. In addition Education contracts with a servicer DL servicer to administer certain aspects of the DL program such as payment processing. The FFEL program relies on lenders guaranty agencies and other entities that are subject to statutory regulatory and contractual audit requirements. The FFEL and DL programs have different statutory and regulatory requirements for audits and program reviews with more audit requirements in place for the FFEL program which involves more participants external to the government. If performed properly the required audits for FFEL and DL participants should address federal and borrower interests. These oversight procedures are designed to assess and evaluate the DL servicers performance in servicing loans in the DL program. Our analysis showed that the objectives of the oversight procedures to be performed by Federal Student Aid over the DL servicer share some similarities with the objectives being addressed by audits of FFEL lenders guaranty agencies and their servicers. According to Federal Student Aids contract monitoring plan these activities will include transaction analysis and reconciliations as well as internal control and program compliance reviews. Each additional DL servicer is to provide Federal Student Aid with an IPA report on the examination of its operational controls semiannually and on the examination of its information technology controls annually. The School Eligibility Channel and Financial Partners are responsible for logging receipt of the audit report performing an acceptability review and taking steps to resolve the audit. For audits performed in accordance with OMB Circular No. A133 Federal Student Aid staff are to ob tain the audit reports from the Federal Audit Clearinghouse Web site a governmentwide audit information repository. Federal Student Aid procedures called for using acceptability review checklists and Excelbased tracking sheets designed specifically for these kinds of reports to ensure completeness of the reports and to track the status and ensure the resolution of reported findings. By not requiring the review of the audited financial statements of lender servicers Federal Student Aid runs the risk of missing significant findings disclosed in these reports. To help address any gaps in the guidance for audits FFEL lenders perform in accordance with the OIG Lender Audit Guide we recommend that the Education Inspector General update the OIG Lender Audit Guide to include all appropriate regulatory audit requirements. Regarding our recommendation to develop and implement policies and procedures requiring the review of lender servicer audited financial statements the Chief Operating Officer of Federal Student Aid acknowledged the need to update the OIG Lender Audit Guide and existing processes and procedures to require lender servicers to prepare and submit audited financial statements and stated that Federal Student Aid will review the audited financial statements. For example we determined if the audit guides focused on determining whether the students and lenders met eligibility requirements to participate in these programs.", "Additionally genetic engineering increases the range of traits available for developing new varieties by allowing genes from totally unrelated species to be incorporated into a particular plant or animal variety. To date the principal biotechnology products marketed have been certain genetically engineered field crops see slide 2. The United States accounts for about threequarters of biotech crops planted globally. The EU on the other hand has established a distinct regime for regulating biotech products and since 1998 has not approved for marketing any new genetically modified organisms. U.S. regulators stress that they also consider scientific evidence and exercise precaution in evaluating new products derived from biotechnology. In advance of international guidelines the EU Japan and Korea have already passed regulations requiring labels for food and food ingredients derived from biotechnology see slide 6. The U.S. government has opposed the inclusion of traceability requirements for biotechnology products in these multilateral discussions. Moreover U.S. industry groups are concerned about the burden these new regulations would place on the U.S. grain handling and food production systems because of the associated documentation requirements and the need to segregate biotech from conventional crop varieties. Corn and soybeans are the principal U.S. commodity exports most threatened by foreign regulations governing biotech products see slide 8. Growing consumer concerns particularly in Europe about the safety of biotechnology underlie actions taken by foreign governments that may restrict biotech trade. For example there are several different U.S. government agencies representing U.S. interests in international organizations on biotech issues and working with other countries bilaterally including USTR USDA FDA and State. To meet our objectives of 1 summarizing developments in key international organizations and among major U.S. trading partners that are likely to affect agricultural biotech trade 2 identifying principal U.S. commodities most affected by foreign regulations on biotechnology exports and 3 describing challenges U.S. biotech exporters face in maintaining access to foreign markets we studied official documents from various U.S. federal agencies and foreign governments.

According to Customs guidelines Customs must follow FDAs penalty recommendation when an importer fails to redeliver a refused shipment for export or destruction. In a followup operation in San Francisco known as Operation Bad Apple and started in July 1997 Customs and FDA found a number of substitution and other problems such as invoices that falsely identified the product. A number of factors contribute to FDAs and Customs problems in ensuring that targeted shipments are actually inspected and that refused entries are properly disposed of. That is unscrupulous importers will distribute into domestic commerce shipments refused entry and substitute for reexport a shipment that arrives at a later date. Nonetheless as a result of these coordination problems at the five ports Customs had not issued notices of redelivery to the importers. We believe that FSIS controls over import shipmentsrequiring unique markings on each carton retaining custody of shipments until they are approved for release or properly disposed of and stamping U.S. In some cases Customs did not impose the maximum allowable penalty3 times the shipments declared valuebecause the penalty exceeded the value of the bond that the importer had posted. This approach also has several limitations. Customs and FDA could take steps to better ensure that importers with a history of violations are not substituting products before inspection and are not returning the actual refused cargo for destruction or reexport by adopting variations on controls used by FSIS for meat and poultry imports. To help prevent substitution before inspection FDA could require the shipments of importers or products with a history of violations to have unique identification marks on each product container and on entry documents filed with Customs. Second in lieu of the first approach or until this approach is implemented Customs and FDA could work out a manual system such as reconciling FDA refusal and Customs redelivery notices. By statute importers of FDAregulated foods are allowed 90 days to redeliver products after being issued the notice of refusal in contrast to importers of FSISregulated foods which are allowed a 45day redelivery period.

In the absence of a budget line item the CIO is requiring each facility to develop spend plans for fiscal year 2003 IT funding. Developing and implementing an enterprise architecture to guide VAs information technology activities continues to be an essential and challenging undertaking. VA officials describe the architecture as a topdown businessfocused document that provides a blueprint for systematically defining and documenting the departments desired target environment. The standards profile used in conjunction with the technical reference model assists departmental components in coordinating the acquisition development and interoperability of systems to accomplish the departments enterprise architecture program goals. Beyond these actions VA must continue to enhance the enterprise architecture that it has begun instituting. For example additional work is needed to fully develop the baseline and target architectures to encompass all of the departments business functions identify common areas of business and eliminate duplication of processes across the organization through business process reengineering. Contributing significantly to VAs computer security problems has been its lack of a fully implemented comprehensive computer security management programessential to managing risks to business operations that rely on its automated and highly interconnected systems. The cyber security officer also had updated the departments security management plan outlining actions for developing riskbased security assessments improving the monitoring and testing of systems controls and implementing departmentwide virusdetection software and intrusion detection systems. More recently as discussed earlier VAs realignment of its information technology resources placed administration and field office security functions more directly under the oversight of the departments CIO. Further while VA has established a departmental process for assessing computer controls the process relies on VAs offices to self report computer control weaknesses with no independent validation component to ensure the accuracy of reporting. Similarly an effective computer security management program should include a process for ensuring that remedial action is taken to address significant deficiencies and that it provides steps to analyze weaknesses reported for identifiable trends and vulnerabilities and to apply appropriate countermeasures as needed. All but one of the software applications comprising the new system still need to be fully deployed or developed and VBA is currently processing only nine benefits claims using its new software products. Once these activities are accomplished VBA plans to begin its conversion to the new system with a completion date currently set for December 2004.

The current draft framework The Office of the National Coordinator Goals Objectives and Strategiesidentifies objectives for accomplishing each of four goals along with 32 highlevel strategies for meeting the objectives including the two strategies for protecting consumer privacy. This law provided for the Secretary of HHS to establish the first broadly applicable federal privacy and security protections designed to protect individual health care information. Specifically HHS awarded several health IT contracts that include requirements for developing solutions that comply with federal privacy and security requirements consulted with the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics NCVHS to develop recommendations regarding privacy and confidentiality in the Nationwide Health Information Network and formed the American Health Information Community AHIC Confidentiality Privacy and Security Workgroup to frame privacy and security policy issues and identify viable options or processes to address these issues. It is also to deliver an interim report to address policies and practices followed in nine domains of interest 1 user and entity authentication 2 authorization and access controls 3 patient and provider identification to match identities 4 information transmission security or exchange protocols encryption etc. The recommendations cover topics that are according to the committee central to challenges for protecting health information privacy in a national health information exchange environment. For example the privacy and security solutions contractor has not yet reported its assessment of state and organizational policy variations. Until HHS defines an integration approach and milestones for completing these steps its overall approach for ensuring the privacy and protection of personal health information exchanged throughout a nationwide network will remain unclear. The increased use of information technology to exchange electronic health information introduces challenges to protecting individuals personal health information. In our report we identify and summarize key challenges described by health information exchange organizations understanding and resolving legal and policy issues particularly those resulting from varying state laws and policies ensuring appropriate disclosures of the minimum amount of health information needed ensuring individuals rights to request access to and amendments of health information to ensure it is correct and implementing adequate security measures for protecting health information. Table 2 summarizes these challenges. For example user authentication will become more difficult when multiple organizations that employ different techniques exchange information. 2. Ensure that key privacy principles in HIPAA are fully addressed. We disagree and believe that milestones are important for setting targets for implementation and for informing stakeholders of HHSs plans and goals for protecting personal health information as part of its efforts to achieve nationwide implementation of health IT.

Tucker and Morgan F. Walts.", "According to an April 2008 UN report the increase in attacks resulted from Shia militias fighting Iraqi security forces throughout southern Iraq as well as an increase in incidents of roadside bomb attacks against Iraqi security forces and MNFI in Baghdad. The Iraqi security forces comprise Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Interior forces that vary in size. Overall the number of Iraqi military and police personnel has increased from about 142000 in March 2005 to about 445000 in April 2008. The Ministries of Defense and Interior were not capable of accounting for supporting or fully controlling their forces in the field nor do the Iraqi security forces have critical enablers such as intelligence and logistics systems and processes that permit independent planning and operations. For example as a result of the February 2007 Baghdad Security Plan an increased number of terrorists insurgents and members of illegal militia fled Baghdad for other provinces and the Iraqi police were unable to handle these threats. In 2007 in The New Way Forward the U.S. government identified legislation that the Iraqi government committed to enact by December 31 2007. This section discusses Iraqs progress toward spending its capital budget and U.S. efforts to improve Iraqi budget execution. The New Way Forward emphasized the need to build capacity in Iraqs ministries and help the government execute its capital investment budgets. Iraqs inability to spend its considerable resources limits the governments efforts to further economic development advance reconstruction projects and at the most basic level deliver essential services to the Iraqi people. In contrast a campaign plan is developed at the operational level. Since 2003 the United States has developed and revised multiple strategies to address security and reconstruction needs in Iraq. The Iraqi government has passed key legislation to return some Baathists to government give amnesty to detained Iraqis and define provincial powers. The State Department disagreed with our recommendation to develop an updated strategic plan stating that while the military surge ends the strategic goals of The New Way Forward remain largely unchanged. Third the goals and objectives of The New Way Forward and the phase that follows it are contained in disparate documents such as Presidential speeches White House fact sheets and an NSC power point presentation rather than in a strategic planning document similar to the National Strategy for Victory in Iraq the prior U.S. strategy for Iraq. To update data on the results of U.S. efforts to develop Iraqi security forces we reviewed DOD and MNFI documents showing the capabilities and size of the Iraqi army and police units. 3. 6. An updated U.S. strategy must reflect changes in conditions in Iraq by assessing the progress made over the past 18 months targeting the unmet goals of the New Way Forward and articulating our longterm strategic objectives for Iraq.", "DOD collects information on the extent of foreign participation in its contracts to assess matters related to defense trade balances and domestic industrial base capabilities. For example one contractor said it would report subcontracts awarded to a foreign subsidiary of a U.S. company because the subsidiary would be manufacturing overseas. The DD 2139 database lacks documentation defining the databases structure critical data fields and procedures for data entry all of which makes the data highly questionable. As a result the database contained information that was inconsistent with the reporting criteria specified in the statutory requirement. Data on DOD subcontracts performed outside the United States could provide important information for making decisions on foreign sourcing and industrial base issues. In addition weaknesses in the Offices data collection process significantly limit DODs ability to use consistent data on foreign subcontractlevel procurements. We also recommend that the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology direct the Director of the Office of Defense Procurement to develop and implement controls and procedures for periodically verifying compliance with the foreign subcontract reporting requirement and specify how to transmit the information to the Office of Foreign Contracting as a means of improving the completeness and consistency of its data and develop and implement procedures for entering data verifying critical fields documenting database programs and querying the database to improve the Offices database management practices. Finally in our attempt to match entries from the DD 2139 database with the subset of information on foreign subcontracts found in the Defense Contract Management District International database we found subcontracts that should have been in the DD 2139 database but were not. DOD guidance however states that database managers must have written documentation to maintain their systems. 2. Furthermore officials from defense companies told us that the Office of Foreign Contracting had not contacted them to verify the data they had submitted.

In this regard from August 2006 through October 2007 DOE conducted a preapplication process to help it develop final regulations develop and test policies criteria and procedures for reviewing preapplications and determine which projects it would invite to apply for loan guarantees. Specifically it lacks instruction and detail regarding how DOE will determine project eligibility and review applications such as roles and responsibilities criteria for conducting and documenting analyses and decision making. DOE does not delineate how it will evaluate project eligibilitythat is how each project achieves substantial environmental benefits and employs new or significantly improved technologies. DOE has hired a director of monitoring and according to DOE officials is currently developing policies and procedures that will include 1 processes for identifying eligible lenders through a competitive process as well as an associated checklist and guide for evaluating potential lenders and 2 loan servicing and monitoring guidelines. The nature and characteristics of the LGP will make estimating the programs subsidy costs difficult even if DOE develops a sound and comprehensive methodology. To the extent that DOE underestimates the fee and does not collect enough fees from borrowers to cover the actual subsidy costs taxpayers will bear the cost of any shortfall. More than a year has passed since DOE received funding to administer the LGP and we recommended steps it should take to help manage the program effectively and maintain accountability. Moreover because loan guarantee programs generally pose financial risk to the federal government and this program has additional inherent risks it is critical that DOE complete basic management and accountability activities to help ensure that it will use taxpayer resources prudently. DOE stated that it did not need to take additional action to implement our recommendation that it clarify the LGPs equity requirements with the 16 companies invited to apply and in future solicitations because it informed the 16 companies invited to apply of DOEs equity position. Specifically we reviewed and analyzed the LGPs concept of operations technical and financial review criteria for the preapplication process DOEs Application Process Overview Guidance Preapplication Evaluation Procedural Guidance minutes of Credit Review Board meetings held between April 2007 and February 2008 and other relevant documents. We reviewed all decision files DOE provided to us and analyzed the documentation for the preapplications that DOE considered responsive to the August 2006 solicitation to determine if DOE conducted its review process consistently and documented its decisions sufficiently. 7. We would expect one component of these policies and procedures to explain how DOE will identify estimate the cost of and fund modifications. As stated in the report the inherent risks of the program along with the expectation that borrowers will cover the costs of their loan guarantees may lead to selfselection bias that tilts the portfolio of projects toward those for which costs have been underestimated. In addition when evaluating preapplications DOE did not combine technical and financial scores. 17. Federal loan guarantees do help borrowers obtain more favorable terms than they may otherwise obtain.", "In the course of providing these diagnostic consultations to the requesting physicians AFIP receives and is able to add pathology material to its repository. AFIP in conjunction with ARP offers a variety of courses conferences and other educational services generally for physicians and tailors its curriculum to the most common as well as the most difficulttodiagnose diseases. Research is conducted by AFIP pathologists as well as by other federal and private researchers in collaboration with AFIP pathologists primarily using material from the repository. AFIP conducts and collaborates on research applicable to military operations and general medicine so its research affects DOD VA and civilian communities. Pending the outcome of this review USUHS may employ 1012 pathologists who would spend the majority of their time on research these pathologists would also be responsible for classifying pathology material in the repository. According to DODs most recently developed implementation plan execution of the BRAC provision regarding AFIP was scheduled to begin in July 2007 and be complete by September 2011. Although USUHS has not finalized its plans regarding the repository its intent is to make the pathology material accessible to others including civilian researchers to the extent it is approved by DOD practicable and legally feasible. Given that AFIP is a central source that provides its customers with definitive consults on the most difficulttodiagnose cases DOD and VA pathologists face challenges in obtaining similar consultative expertise once AFIP is disestablished. Several military pathologists expressed concerns about the challenges DOD and VA would face in identifying and obtaining needed subspecialty expertise from pathologists. DOD pathologists also indicated that as of August 2007 DOD had not yet developed a management strategy to address this challenge. Because DOD has not developed its strategy regarding how it will populate maintain and use the repository some pathologists we interviewed were concerned about the future of the repository and whether it would continue to be a viable research tool. We recommend that the Secretary of Defense include in the December 2007 plan to Congress implementation strategies for how DOD will use existing inhouse pathology expertise available within MTFs identify and obtain needed consultation services from subspecialty pathologists with appropriate expertise through the PMO in a timely manner and solidify the source and organization of funds to be used for outsourced consultation services. We also added another recommendation that DOD should report to Congress at a later date on USUHSs planned strategies for managing the repository. VA focused on five concernsDU testing stagnation of the repository difficulties in replacing AFIPs consultation services and obtaining them through the PMO potential impact on patient care and the potential costs to replace existing services. In 2006 AFIP provided almost half of its consultations for DOD with the rest predominantly for VA and civilian physicians. GAO07166. Washington D.C. June 30 2005. Military Base Closures Observations on Preparations for the Upcoming Base Realignment and Closure Round.", "The annual number of fatalities from crashes involving large trucks increased 20 percent from 4462 in 1992 to 5355 in 1997 see fig. 2. For each mile that they traveled between 198897 large trucks were involved in fewer total crashes than cars were. The higher fatal crash rate for large trucks is not surprising considering the difference in weight between large trucks and cars. In fatal crashes between large trucks and cars in 1997 98 percent of the fatalities were occupants of the car. However a recent study found that in fatal crashes in 1994 and 1995 in which both the truck driver and the car driver survived car driver errors were cited in 74 percent of the crashes compared to 35 percent for truck driver errors. OMCHS estimates that truck driver fatigue is the primary factor in 15 to 33 percent of the crashes that are fatal to the truck occupants only and 1 to 2 percent of crashes that are fatal to people besides the truck occupants. Other factors that may contribute to crashes or that may affect whether a fatality occurs in a crash include drivers blood alcohol concentration and use of safety belts. The Federal Highway Administration has established a goal for 1999 of reducing the number of fatalities from crashes involving large trucks to fewer than 5126the number of fatalities that occurred in 1996. Each year OMCHS and state inspectors conduct thousands of onsite reviews of motor carriers compliance with federal safety regulations known as compliance reviews. For 1997 OMCHS estimated that about 38 percent of all reportable crashes and 30 percent of the fatal crashes involving large trucks were not reported to MCMIS. SafeStat uses the census datasuch as the number of trucks operated by each carrierto normalize safety data. However they are still not meeting OMCHS reporting deadlines. OMCHS December 1996 guidance to states includes deadlines to report the results of roadside inspections and compliance reviews within 21 days and crashes within 90 days. OMCHS officials said that insufficient datasuch as carrier size information that is used to help states focus their safety education programs for carriershave also been a problem for some states once they have identified problem areas and are developing improvement plans. Several of OMCHS activities that could improve large truck safetyincluding revising the rule governing the number of hours that truck drivers can drive and targeting highrisk carriers through the number of citations drivers receivewill not be completed before the end of 1999. OMCHS officials have stated that they plan to develop software that will track the number of citations drivers for each carrier receive. Because of the large contribution of car driver errors to fatal crashes between large trucks and cars OMCHS launched the NoZone campaign in 1994.", "In addition trialtype hearings were completed for three projects with the resource agencies prevailing in most of the issues in these hearings. In fiscal year 2006 nonfederal stakeholders used section 241 provisions for 19 projects undergoing relicensing. Of the 25 projects stakeholders proposed alternative conditions for 19 and alternative prescriptions for 9. In all resource agencies did not formally accept any alternatives as originally proposed and instead modified a total of 140 preliminary conditions and prescriptions for 22 of rejected a total of 42 alternative conditions and prescriptions in 5 projects and removed a total of 9 preliminary conditions and prescriptions in 4 projects. Section 241 directs the Secretary of the relevant resource agency to explain the basis for any condition or prescription the agency adopts provide a reason for not accepting any alternative condition under this section and demonstrate that it gave equal consideration to the effects of the alternatives on energy supply distribution cost and use flood control navigation water supply and air quality in addition to the preservation of other aspects of environmental quality. The ALJ must issue an order that recites any agreements reached at the conference and any rulings made by the ALJ during or as a result of the prehearing conference which can include dismissing issues the ALJ determines are not disputed issues of material fact. Most licensees and a few resource agency officials that we spoke with said that section 241 encourages settlement agreements between the licensee and resource agency. Specifically they noted the following If licensees request a trialtype hearing resource agencies and licensees have to devote time and resources to preparing for the potential upcoming trialtype hearing instead of negotiating a settlement. Section 241 made the relicensing process less cooperative and more antagonistic when for example a licensee did not conduct the agencies requested studies the agencies had less information to support their conditions and prescriptions. Some licensees used their ability to request a trialtype hearing as a threat against the agencies issuance of certain conditions prescriptions or recommendations. Many of the agency officials licensees and other stakeholders we spoke with had suggestions on how to improve section 241 and the relicensing process. Several environmental group representatives commented that while section 241 allows stakeholders to propose alternative conditions and prescriptions they would like to be allowed to propose additional conditions and prescriptions to address issues that the resource agencies have not addressed in their preliminary conditions and prescriptions. Almost 5 years have passed since the interim rules were issued and several stakeholders that we spoke with expressed interest in having an opportunity to comment on a draft of the revised rules when they become available and before these rules become final. All parties involved in relicensing a hydropower project have an interest in understanding how the conditions and prescriptions for a license were modified if at all in response to proposed alternatives. Indeed the interim rules require agencies to provide for any condition or prescription a written statement explaining the basis for the adopted condition and the reasons for not accepting any alternative condition or prescription. We provided the departments of Agriculture Commerce and the Interior FERC the Hydropower Reform Coalition and the National Hydropower Association with a draft of this report for their review and comment. We continue to believe that providing an explanation for not accepting a proposed alternative is warranted even when the proposed alternative is voluntarily withdrawn as a result of negotiations and we have modified our recommendation to address this situation.

Generally state licensing boards maintain a database that contains information on any restrictions or revocations of physicians licenses. For their reappointments physicians must update this credentialing information in VetPro. This type of check is known as primary source verification. This query enables officials to determine whether physicians fully disclosed to VA any involvement they might have had in paid medical malpractice claims. Once a physicians credentialing information has been verified the medical staff specialist sends the information to the physicians supervisor who is known as a clinical service chief. Figure 1 illustrates VAs credentialing process. The requested clinical privileges are reviewed by a clinical service chief who recommends whether a physician should be appointed or reappointed to the facilitys medical staff and which clinical privileges should be granted. The list of approved clinical privileges with the date of approval is maintained at VA medical facilities and the initial appointment or reappointment date is entered into VetPro. According to VAs policy and a VA memorandum information concerning individual physician performance that is used as part of the privileging process to either reduce revoke or support granting clinical privileges must be collected separately from a medical facilitys quality assurance program. VAs policy is based on a federal law that restricts the disclosure of documents produced in the course of VAs quality assurance program. Medical facility officials are required to submit to VAs Office of MedicalLegal Affairs information on paid VA malpractice claims. VA medical facility officials also would use this determination to decide whether to grant clinical privileges to the physician involved in the VA medical malpractice claim. VA also implemented our recommendation that it enforce its requirement that VA medical facilities report information on any paid VA malpractice claims involving their physicians to VAs Office of MedicalLegal Affairs within 60 days after being notified of a paid claim. Internal controls help ensure that VA medical facility officials have accurate clinical privileging information and that physicians are not practicing at the facility with expired clinical privileges.

According to official reporting by the Ministry of Finance as of August 31 2007 Iraqi ministries spent only 4.4 percent of their 2007 investment budget most of which is for capital projects. Appendix II provides further analysis of 2007 Ministry of Finance expenditure data and comparable 2006 data. These funds are in addition to approximately 2 billion in 2006 provincial funds most of which had not been transferred to the provinces until November and December of 2006. Third U.S. and foreign officials also noted that weaknesses in Iraqi procurement budgeting and accounting procedures impede completion of capital projects. The security situation also hinders U.S. advisors ability to provide the ministries with assistance and monitor capital project performance. Violence and sectarian strife have reduced the pool of available talent to budget and complete capital projects and in many cases have increased the time needed to complete projects. In addition as discussed earlier in response to IMF requirements the government of Iraq began implementing a new budget classification and chart of accounts in 2007 that does not provide a separate breakout of capital projects spending. In addition to these recently established efforts which are specifically designed to help the Iraqi government execute its capital projects budget several broader ongoing capacitybuilding assistance efforts are under way. This USAID program is to improve public administration skills at the ministerial level and has provided training in a range of issues including project management budgeting fiscal management leadership and information technology. Treasury and State provided written comments which are reprinted in appendixes IV and V. Treasury State and USAID also provided technical comments and suggested wording changes that we incorporated as appropriate. First Treasury stated that our analysis of Iraqs budget execution was based on incomplete and unofficial reporting in particular the unofficial July 15 2007 data used to comply with a congressional reporting requirement the September 2007 Iraq Benchmark Assessment Report. The administration highlighted this unofficial data in the September 2007 benchmark report to Congress to assert that Iraqs central government and provinces were becoming more effective at spending their capital budgets. However the disparity between the different sets of data calls into question their reliability and whether they can be used to draw firm conclusions about the extent to which the Iraqi government has increased its spending on capital projects in 2007 compared with 2006. To obtain a better understanding of Iraqi capital budget and spending data and Iraqi practices in developing expenditure data we interviewed U.S. officials with the Departments of Defense DOD State State and the Treasury Treasury and the U.S. Agency for International Development USAID in Washington D.C. and Baghdad. We also reviewed U.S. embassy reports on Iraqi budget execution Iraqi government instructions for executing the budget Iraqs Financial Management Law the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction SIGIRs July 2007 Quarterly and Semiannual Report to the Congress and the administrations July and September 2007 Benchmark Assessment Reports. Budget execution is a relative measure comparing actual expenditures to the budget. We are presenting the PRT data for informational purposes even though our field work raised questions about their reliability.", "The secretary of state delegated the secretarys authority under the law to the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations OBO. At that time the department identified potentially unneeded properties through a variety of ad hoc and uncoordinated actions that we believed did not constitute an organized and effective system for identifying such properties. Since 1996 OBO has taken steps to implement a more systematic process for identifying unneeded properties which has resulted in post and OBO officials placing greater emphasis on identifying properties that could be sold. Inaccurate inventory information can result in unneeded properties not being identified for potential sale. In 2001 the State Department began several initiatives intended to expedite the sale of unneeded properties including 1 using business case analyses to ensure that financial and economic factors were included in the property sales decision process 2 emphasizing the use of commercial real estate marketing services and 3 more aggressively focusing on resolving property disputes. This is a threefold increase in proceeds compared with the 65 properties the department sold for more than 133 million from fiscal years 1992 through 1996 see fig. 1. Another initiative designed to expedite property sales is OBOs award of indefinite quantity contracts to several international real estate brokerage firms for real estate marketing services. The State Department has not yet sold 19 of 26 properties recommended for sale by the Real Property Advisory Board and approved by department management. While OBO has taken action to expedite property sales difficulties reaching consensus within the State Department on sales of individual properties continue to cause delays. On the basis of these comments we deleted this recommendation from the report. We also examined OBOs policies and processes for entering information into its real property worldwide database and issues affecting quality control over this information and we reviewed the departments worldwide property inventory as part of our effort to assess the accuracy of the property database. To determine whether the State Department has implemented the Real Property Advisory Boards recommendations we analyzed the House conference report that directed the department to establish the board our prior and State IG reports and applicable department policies and guidance in the Foreign Affairs Manual and Foreign Affairs Handbook. In addition we analyzed the minutes of the advisory boards meetings and other records to determine the number of properties submitted to the board for review from 1997 through 2001 the boards recommendations for these properties sell retain revisit or other and the current status of these properties sold retained or awaiting sale. Sold in 2000 for 1.05 million. Retained as site for new office building after security concerns made embassy site unsuitable. Property retained for recreational use. The following are GAOs comments on the Department of States letter dated May 15 2002.", "The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act IIRIRA of 1996 required the former INS and SSA to operate three voluntary pilot programs to test electronic means for employers to verify an employees eligibility to work one of which was the Basic Pilot Program. Those queries that the DHS automated check cannot confirm are referred to DHS immigration status verifiers who check employee information against information in other DHS databases. SSA officials told us they have estimated that expansion of the EEV program to levels predicted by the end of fiscal year 2007 would cost 5 to 6 million but SSA was not yet able to provide us estimates for the cost of a mandatory EEV. In addition according to SSA officials a mandatory EEV program would require additional staff at SSA field offices to accommodate an increase in the number of individuals visiting SSA field offices to resolve tentative nonconfirmations. In prior work we reported that secondary verifications lengthen the time needed to complete the employment verification process. With regard to the SSAissued tentative nonconfirmations USCIS and SSA officials told us that the majority occur because employees citizenship status or other information such as name changes is not up to date in the SSA database. SSA is also coordinating with USCIS to develop an automated secondary verification capability which may reduce the need for employers to take additional steps after the employee resolves the SSA tentative nonconfirmation. In our prior work we reported that EEV enhances the ability of participating employers to reliably verify their employees work eligibility and assists participating employers with identification of false documents used to obtain employment. The large number and variety of acceptable work authorization documents27 under the current employment verification processalong with inherent vulnerabilities to counterfeiting of some of these documents may complicate efforts to address identity fraud. Since then USCIS has added staff to its verification office and created a Compliance and Monitoring program to review employers use of the EEV system.", "The new rules also addressed multiple recommendations from the National Broadband Plan. Specifically FCC established the Mobility Fund which is the first universal service mechanism dedicated to ensuring availability of mobile voice and broadband services in areas where service is currently not available. FCC has also adopted a rule to limit support to carriers whose enduser rates i.e. The law requires that urban and rural rates be reasonably comparable which FCC has implemented by requiring that rural consumers pay no more than two standard deviations above the average of what urban consumers pay for the same level of voice service. Analyzing the carrier data could enable FCC to determine the programs effectiveness because the analysis would provide some definitive examples of the connection between the level of subsidy and the specific demographic factors of the service areas that have shown an increase in broadband access. However because FCC does not include carrier revenues in determining USF support payments for the carriers FCC will allow carriers that subsequently raise their rates to the national urban average to receive the support payments they were initially denied when their rates were below the specified floor. As FCC looks to broaden the scope of the highcost program by providing support for broadband capable networks it is therefore important for FCC to ensure that the limited program funds are used as effectively and efficiently as possible to stem further growth in the fund. In the USF Transformation Order FCC instituted performance goals and measures with the intention of ensuring that the reforms achieve their intended purpose and will require those carriers receiving support from the Connect America Fund to submit additional information. Lacking such analysis the programs achievements and overall effectiveness are less likely to be clear and Congress and FCC might not have the information necessary to make informed decisions about the programs future. We provided a draft of this report to FCC for its review and comment. We met with telecommunications stakeholders including associations representing consumers small and large telecommunications carriers and state regulatory commissions to obtain their views on FCCs management of and the changes made to the highcost program.

When selecting investments the Human Resource Management unit uses its established annual budget formulation process while the Region and Center Operations unit is moving toward a new process whereby in order to be selected investments need to demonstrate at a minimum that they 1 are compliant with FAAs architecture 2 have a business sponsor 3 have a solid business case and 4 can be funded. In January 2004 the FAA Administrator established the Information Technology Executive Board ITEB to strengthen FAAs ability to use IT as an agencywide strategic asset and guide fundamental changes in the governance of IT assets. In order to have the capabilities to effectively manage IT investments an agency should at a minimum 1 build an investment foundation by putting basic projectlevel control and selection practices in place Stage 2 capabilities and 2 manage its projects as a portfolio of investments treating them as an integrated package of competing investment options and pursuing those that best meet the strategic goals objectives and mission of the agency and it should also conduct PIRs to maintain mature integrated selection control and evaluation processes Stage 3 capabilities. To ensure that the boards decisions are carried out an acquisition program baseline document is approved at the JRC final investment decision point this document identifies the capabilities benefits costs and schedule for the approved investment which are monitored by FAA through its variance reporting process. Table 5 shows the rating for each key practice required to implement the critical process for meeting business needs at the Stage 2 level of maturity and summarizes the evidence that supports these ratings. Also FAAs AMS sets forth policies and procedures for reselecting ongoing IT investments by identifying their capability shortfalls and addressing them as new investments. Even though individual business units may have some of these processes in place FAA as a whole has not yet defined an investment management structure that allows the agency to consistently manage its nonNAS investments a uniform process for ensuring that nonNAS investments are linked to business needs and meet users needs a process for selecting new IT proposals and reselecting ongoing a single process for reviewing the progress of investments and taking corrective action when performance expectations are not being met or a comprehensive inventory of project and system information to support investment decisions. As previously discussed an IT Executive Board ITEB has been chartered with responsibility for among other things making decisions about nonNAS IT investments but it has not yet taken action on developing a standard process. Once an agency has attained Stage 3 maturity it evaluates its IT investment processes and portfolios to identify opportunities for improvement Stage 4 capabilities. DOT has recently initiated several efforts that can serve to provide better departmental oversight of FAA investments. Also FAA has yet to define and implement the practices it needs to select and control its nonNAS investments. Establish a process for the JRC to periodically reevaluate the alignment of projects in the inservice management phase with strategic goals and objectives. For the nonNAS investments we reviewed the results of FAAs self assessments of Stage 2 practices using GAOs ITIM framework and conducted interviews to clarify and update the results.

Comprehensive Exit was initiated to develop and implement a means to capture biometric information from travelers who are subject to USVISIT as they exit the United States and to do so in a way that integrates biometrics collection into existing exit procedures at air sea and land POEs and enables the matching of biometric exit and entry records to determine which travelers have left the country. For example this component allows for the biographic and biometric information provided by a departing passenger to be matched against a watch list and if a hit is found the passengers IDENT record is annotated to make the information available for any future encounters between that individual and other agencies such as CBP U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or local law enforcement. Final testing of Phase 1 was completed in April 2009 with all planned requirements and test cases executed and five problems of low and medium severity detected. Given that the Comprehensive Exit project is part of the larger USVISIT program and consists of multiple components involving several DHS component organizations it is important for the project to be planned and executed in an integrated fashion. To this end the USVISIT program office has established integrated project management plans and has adopted an integrated approach to interacting with and involving project stakeholders both of which are important ingredients to project success. Specifically the project management plan calls for tailoring the ELCM framework which defines a standard set of project management processes. Agreeing on roles and responsibilities working together to define and agree on partners respective roles and responsibilities including how the collaboration efforts will be led. The USVISIT program office CBP and TSA have established joint management strategies for executing the Air Exit Pilots and the Temporary Worker Visa Exit Pilot. The plan also requires that the project schedule be horizontally and vertically integrated that all scheduled milestones and tasks be linked logically and that schedule status be captured on a regular basis. However neither schedule reflects a valid critical path due to a high number of missing dependencies and rigid schedule constraints. Nevertheless if and when Comprehensive Exit will be operational remains unclear in part because DHS still does not have an integrated master schedule defining the timing and sequencing of the work and events needed to deliver USVISIT exit capabilities to its air sea and land ports of entry. In written comments on a draft of this report signed by the Director Departmental GAOOffice of the Inspector General Liaison Office and reprinted in appendix III the department stated that it concurred with our recommendation. We also interviewed officials from the USVISIT program office U.S. Customs and Border Protection CBP and the Transportation Security Administration TSA to determine how the comprehensive exit solution is being designed and implemented and what future plans for the project have been developed.", "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC in the Department of Health and Human Services is the federal agency primarily responsible for monitoring the incidence of foodborne illness in the United States. For reporting purposes CDC categorizes the causes of outbreaks of foodborne illnesses as bacterial chemical viral parasitic or unknown pathogens. Bacterial pathogens can be easily transmitted and can multiply rapidly in food making them difficult to control. The existing data on foodborne illnesses have weaknesses and may not fully depict the extent of the problem. Between 6.5 million and 81 million cases of foodborne illness and as many as 9100 related deaths occur each year according to the estimates provided by several studies conducted over the past 10 years. While foodborne illnesses are often temporary they can also result in more serious illnesses requiring hospitalization longterm disability and death. Although the overall cost of foodborne illnesses is not known two recent USDA estimates place some of the costs in the range of 5.6 billion to more than 22 billion per year. In recent years outbreaks have been caused by the consumption of many different foods of animal origin including beef poultry eggs milk and dairy products and pork. In addition 14 deaths may have been associated with this outbreak. In the second analysis ERS used the willingnesstopay method to estimate the value of preventing deaths for five of the seven major pathogens included in the first analysis at 6.6 billion to 22 billion in 1992. According to CDC states do not 1 report on all pathogens of concern 2 usually identify whether food was the source of the illness or 3 identify many of the outbreaks or individual cases of foodborne illness that occur. In July 1995 CDC FDA and FSIS began a comprehensive effort to track the major bacterial pathogens that cause foodborne illnesses. CDC and the five sites will use the information to identify emerging foodborne pathogens and monitor the incidence of foodborne illness. FSIS will use the data to evaluate the effectiveness of new food safety programs and regulations to reduce foodborne pathogens in meat and poultry and assist in future program development. As we previously testified to this Committee the current system was not developed under any rational plan but evolved over many years to address specific health threats from particular food products and has not responded to changing health risks. For example as we reported in June 1992 food products posing the same risk are subject to different rules limited inspection resources are inefficiently used and agencies must engage in extensive and often unsuccessful coordination activities in an attempt to address food safety issues.

The deposit insurance fund administered by FDIC to resolve failed banks and thrifts protects depositors from losses due to institution failures up to a limit. Individually and collectively government lending guarantee and capital programs provided important liquidity and other benefits to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries including Access to funding in quantities andor at prices that were generally not available in the markets. As discussed below we compared program pricing to relevant indicators of market pricing where available and found that emergency lending and guarantee programs generally were priced below market alternatives that may have been available. TAF auctioned collateralized loansgenerally at terms of either 28 or 84 daysto insured banks to help alleviate strains in term funding markets. CPFF purchased 3month commercial paper at prices that were lower than market rates during the crisis on instruments that could have represented alternative funding sources but were more expensive than average commercial paper rates during normal market conditions. During the financial crisis the Federal Reserve Board granted a number of exemptions to requirements under Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act for a range of purposes such as allowing banks to provide greater liquidity support to the nonbank sector. The DoddFrank Act made numerous changes to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act that both significantly expanded the scope of activities covered by Section 23As restrictions and created new requirements for participation by FDIC and the OCC in granting exceptions. For example FDIC could face difficulties in effectively managing the failure of one or more large bank holding companies or credibly imposing losses on the creditors of those holding companies. Consistent with that intention in July 2013 FDIC the Federal Reserve Board and OCC finalized a rule that revised riskbased and leverage capital requirements for banking organizations. While the act continues to allow the Federal Reserve Board to use its authority under Section 133 of the Federal Reserve Act to authorize programs with broadbased eligibility it sets forth new restrictions and requirements for such programs including a requirement that lending not assist insolvent firms. To better ensure that the design and implementation of any future emergency lending programs comply with DoddFrank Act requirements in a timely manner we recommend that the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System set timeframes for completing the process for drafting policies and procedures governing the use of emergency lending authority under Section 133 of the Federal Reserve Act. During the financial crisis the Federal Reserve System Treasury and FDIC introduced new programs with broadbased eligibility to provide general funding support to the banking sector and stabilize the financial system. On March 11 2008 the Federal Reserve Board announced the creation of TSLF to auction 28day loans of U.S. Treasury securities to primary dealers to increase the amount of highquality collateral available for these dealers to borrow against in the repurchase agreement markets. In late 2008 the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers triggered an intensification of the crisis and the Federal Reserve System Treasury and FDIC took a range of new actions to provide additional support to financial institutions and key credit markets. Emergency government programs to stabilize financial markets resulted in funding support to bank holding companies and insured depository institutions collectively banking organizations of various sizes. For banking organizations with a high holder that was in our data and that included at least one bank holding company we excluded those for which the high holder did not report consolidated assets those for which the high holder reported consolidated assets but they were less than its parentonly assets those for which the high holders consolidated assets were less than consolidated assets reported by some other bank holding company in the organization those for which none of the bank holding companies reported consolidated assets and those that did not contain any depository institutions. For banking organizations that continued to participate in CPP participation rates ranged from about 4.8 percent for banking organizations with less than 500 million in assets to 35 percent for banking organizations with at least 50 billion but less than 250 billion in assets.", "According to the North American Industry Classification System the U.S. forest products industry is divided into two sectors wood product manufacturing and pulp and paper manufacturing. The other 11 research work units are located in the Forest Services Northeastern Southern Pacific Northwest Pacific Southwest and Rocky Mountain Research Stations and these units mostly focus on regional wood utilization issues. CSREES provides support for wood utilization research and product development through several grant programs. We grouped the wood utilization research and product development activities that the 12 agencies conduct into five broad categories harvesting wood properties manufacturing and processing products and testing and economics and marketing. Our data for fiscal year 2005 are complete except for data for the CSREES grants funded under the McIntyreStennis Act and the Hatch Act the National Research Initiative Small Business Innovation Research grants and other small grants. Of the 54.4 million made available in fiscal year 2004 about 34 million 28.3 million for the Forest Service and 5.7 million for the CSREES wood utilization research centers was directly targeted to wood utilization research and product development. Between fiscal years 1995 and 2000 the budget authority declined by 17 percent in 2004 inflationadjusted dollars from 20.8 million to 17.3 million it increased again from fiscal years 2001 through 2004 but was still lower in 2005 than in 1995. While financial support for wood utilization research and product development at the Forest Service has fluctuated moderately during the past 11 years Forest Service scientists and managers expressed concerns about resource constraints. Scientists and technology transfer specialists also provide industry and others with handson technical assistance. HUD through its Partnership for Advancing Technology in Housing program helped a builder in North Carolina to demonstrate the durability and cost of various building materials including insulated composite wood panels in four residential duplex units. The Forest Service has a unit dedicated to transferring the results of wood utilization research and product development activitiesthe TMU part of the State and Private Forestry Program located at the Forest Products Laboratory. Specifically TMU specialists perform the following activities Answer numerous phone inquiries and letters and host visitorsover 2000 in both fiscal years 2004 and 2005. GAO staff who made major contributors to this report are listed in appendix V. This report describes 1 the types of wood utilization research and product development activities supported by federal agencies and how these efforts are coordinated 2 the level of support federal agencies made available for these activities in fiscal years 2004 and 2005 and changes in the level of support at the U.S. Department of Agricultures Forest Service and at the Cooperative State Research Education and Extension Service CSREESfunded wood utilization research centers from fiscal years 1995 through 2005 and 3 how the federal government transfers technologies and products from its wood utilization research and product development activities to industry. To obtain information on the coordination of wood utilization and product development activities among the 12 federal agencies we interviewed agency officials to obtain their views on the use of informal and formal coordination mechanisms. To address the second objectivedescribe the level of support federal agencies made available for wood utilization research and product development activities in fiscal years 2004 and 2005 and changes in the level of support at the Forest Service and CSREES wood utilization research centers from fiscal years 1995 through 2005we collected budget authority or expenditure information from the 12 agencies for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 and from the Forest Service and CSREES wood utilization centers for fiscal years 1995 through 2005. We also reviewed and summarized information from Forest Service documents on the number of scientists and research support staff at the Forest Servicethe only agency that has fulltime federal employees who directly conduct wood utilization research and product development activities. We interviewed knowledgeable agency officials regarding the reliability of these data. To respond to objective threehow the federal government transfers technologies and products from its wood utilization research and product development activities to industrywe obtained and reviewed relevant legislation and policies and procedures on federal technology transfer activities.", "Despite the relatively small share of the market that RRGs hold most state regulators we surveyed who had an opinion33 of 36indicated that RRGs have expanded the availability and affordability of commercial liability insurance for groups that otherwise would have had difficulty in obtaining coverage. As a result RRGs generally domicile in those states that permit their formation as captive insurance companies rather than in the states in which they conduct most of their business. As a result some states chartering RRGs as captives do not obligate them for example to adopt a common set of financial reporting procedures and practices abide by NAICs requirements for riskbased capital or comply with requirements outlined in that states version of NAICs Model Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act. Some regulators including those from New York California and Texas states where RRGs collectively wrote about 26 percent of all their business but did not domicileexpressed concerns that domiciliary states were lowering their regulatory standards to attract RRGs to domicile in their states for economic development purposes. Most leading state regulators said they expect members of RRGs to exert some control over the RRG by having the ability to vote for directors even though these rights sometimes vary in proportion to the size of a members investment in the RRG or by share class. Four states Arizona District of Columbia South Carolina and Vermontreported that they have chartered RRGs that are owned by a single or multiple organizations rather than individual persons or businesses. LRRAs legislative history indicates that the prohibition on RRGs participating in state guaranty funds operated to protect insureds when traditional insurers fail stemmed in part from a belief that the lack of protection would help motivate RRG members to manage the RRG prudently. Not understanding that RRG insureds are not protected by guaranty funds has serious implications for RRG members and their claimants who have lost coverage as a result of RRG failures. In addition regulators who thought that protections in LRRA were inadequate such as those in Wyoming Virginia and Wisconsin tended to view lack of guaranty fund protection as a primary reason for developing and implementing more uniform regulatory standards or providing nondomiciliary states greater regulatory authority over RRGs. RRGs as an industry according to most state insurance regulators have fulfilled this visionand the intent of LRRAby increasing the availability and affordability of insurance for members that experienced difficulty in obtaining coverage. While the regulatory structure applicable to RRGs need not be identical to that used for traditional insurance companies uniform baseline regulatory standards could create a more transparent and protective regulatory environment enhancing the financial strength of RRGs and increasing the trust and confidence of nondomiciliary state regulators. LRRAs provisions for the ownership control and governance of RRGs may not be sufficient to protect the best interests of the insureds. To assess the regulatory framework for regulating RRGs in the six leading domiciliary states the five we visited plus Nevada we also reviewed state statutes and obtained from regulators detailed descriptions of their departments practices for chartering and regulating RRGs. In reviewing how RRGs file financial reports we assessed how the use or modification of two sets of accounting standards generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and statutory accounting principles SAP could affect the ability of NAIC and regulators to analyze the reports. Please note that attached to the email that transmitted this survey is a file that identifies all the RRGs operating in your state as of yearend 2003. GAAP and SAP also treat some assets differently. Although subject to the regulation of one state their domiciliary state RRGs can and do sell insurance in multiple states and are required to provide financial statements to each state in which they sell insurance. NAIC uses financial ratios and riskbased capital standards to evaluate the financial condition of insurance companies and provides this information to state regulators in an effort to help them better target their regulatory efforts.", "Reducing the costs and time of its decisionmaking and improving its ability to deliver what is expected or promised have not been given adequate attention throughout the Forest Service. However the Forest Service has made little progress in implementing the acts provisions. However with no incentive to act the agency has not implemented any of the recommended improvements agencywide. As a result for fiscal year 1998 the agency is requesting 12 million or 6 percent more for timber sales management than was appropriated for fiscal year 1997 while proposing to offer 0.4 billion board feet or 10 percent less timber for sale. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 is designed to hold federal agencies more accountable for their performance by requiring them to establish performance goals measures and reports that provide a system of accountability for results. For example regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act require the agencies to assess the cumulative impact of federal and nonfederal activities on the environment. Because the boundaries of administrative units and natural systems are frequently inconsistent federal land management plans have often considered effects only on portions of natural systems or portions of the habitats of wideranging species such as migratory birds bears and anadromous fish including salmon. federal agencies are often not comparable large gaps in the information exist and federal agencies lack awareness of who has what information. For example three federal circuit courts of appeals have held that the approval of a forest plan represents a decision that can be judicially challenged and prohibited from being implemented. Agency officials perceive that the same issues are recycled under different planning and environmental laws rather than resolved in a timely manner. These different approaches to achieving similar environmental objectives have sometimes been difficult for the Forest Service and other federal agencies to reconcile at least in the short term. On the basis of our work to date we believe that statutory changes to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Forest Services decisionmaking process cannot be identified until after agreement is reached on which uses the agency is to emphasize under its broad multipleuse and sustainedyield mandate and how it is to resolve conflicts or make choices among competing uses on its lands. Our report to you and other requesters to be issued this spring will identify the increasing shift in emphasis in the Forest Services plans from producing timber to sustaining wildlife and fish. Differences among the requirements of planning and environmental laws also need to be addressed. Clarifying priorities within the Forest Services multipleuse and sustainedyield mission should provide the agency with a better understanding of which uses it is to emphasize under its broad multipleuse and sustainedyield mandate and how it is to resolve conflicts or make choices among competing uses on its lands.

From fiscal years 2012 through 2015 SBSE received over 170000 information referrals and WI received over 100000about twothirds of all information referrals routed for further review. Specifically the Fresno ICT does not have documented procedures to ensure that labels used by the clerical staff in sorting screened referrals into the various boxes for routing are consistent with the guidelines developed by the Tiger Team. That Fresno ICT lead clerk is responsible for several key inventory reporting duties which include documenting the number of referrals received counting and mailing those routed to other IRS units and compiling the weekly inventory reports. In addition IRS officials explained that due to time constraints and other priorities in the Fresno ICT information referral inventory reports are not reviewed by a supervisor before relaying the weekly report to Accounts Management. However some units have not returned information referrals misrouted by the Fresno ICT and instead forwarded misroutes directly to other units rather than mailing misroutes back to the ICT for rerouting. However we did identify some issues The public submits referral information on the wrong form or to the wrong office. Although IRS revised the information referral instructions in March 2014 to help clarify how to submit specialized forms directly to other referral programs as shown in table 4 Fresno ICT continues to erroneously receive information referrals that must be routed to those referral programs and the Whistleblower Office. For specialized referrals submitted as information referrals the Fresno ICT first screens and routes the referrals to other IRS referral programs where the referrals again undergo intake and screening. IRS does not have a mechanism to facilitate information sharing across the multiple referral programs used for handling tax noncompliance and other issues reported by the public. State tax agencies and other federal agencies accept fraud referrals via online Internet submission. Finally strengthened collaboration across the nine referral programs could enable IRS to explore a more systemic online referral submission process such an effort could help the agency improve its ability to more efficiently receive and process information referrals while also reducing the public confusion caused by trying to choose among multiple forms. As discussed earlier the public often uses information referrals because it is a general form that is used to report different tax noncompliance however we found that information referrals are misrouted and often retained for destruction. IRS has a fragmented and overlapping system for the public to report tax noncompliance with several units having their own forms and mechanisms for intake and screening. Without a mechanism to coordinate on a plan and timeline for developing a consolidated online referral submission IRS cannot receive referrals efficiently or meet its strategic goal of expanding its portfolio of digital service offerings to the public. This report 1 describes IRSs process for screening and routing Form 3949A information referrals and for prioritizing information referrals within the IRS audit workload 2 assesses the controls for the information referral screening and routing process and 3 evaluates the coordination between the information referral process the Whistleblower Office and other IRS referral programs. We reviewed the IRM and other IRS guidance and interviewed IRS officials for referral programs with forms to determine how the other referral programs receive and screen their referrals and also process information referrals. We interviewed IRS officials about options to coordinate or consolidate referral form intake in order to address areas of potential fragmentation overlap and duplication.", "Each fingerprint card was to include a complete set of fingerprints and other identifying information such as the aliens name and date of birth. To judge if naturalization cases that were processed between August 31 1995 and September 30 1996 were adjudicated correctly and if the naturalization process had adequate controls INS reviewed selected cases to judge on the basis of the information in the files if the naturalized citizens were of good moral character. After reviewing criminal histories provided by the FBI INS identified 17257 applicants who were naturalized between August 31 1995 and September 30 1996 with criminal history records of arrests for felonies or other potentially disqualifying crimes. Using a standardized worksheet INS adjudicators reviewed the case files of these aliens and made independent judgments about the initial adjudication decisions. To help ensure consistency among the INS review adjudicators in their decisionmaking KPMG took a number of actions. Also although the adjudicators who made the initial decisions to approve the aliens naturalization applications had the benefit of discussing the naturalization applications with the aliens the review adjudicators did not meet with the applicants. EOIR reviewed a statistically valid sample of 557 alien case files from the universe of 16858 cases involving aliens who had criminal history records. Specifically EOIR and INS independently judged that 288 cases were proper 147 cases required further action and 4 cases were presumptively ineligible see table 2. Regarding the differences between the INS and EOIR decisions KPMG reported that much of the naturalization process and the review of case file information required the reviewers to make subjective analyses. KPMG concluded that a 79percent agreement rate between EOIR and INS reviewers was the most that could be reasonably expected when considering that the two groups worked independently had varied backgrounds and had to make many subjective analyses. The initial EOIR team was provided with an orientation and the lead EOIR staff member was responsible for providing the orientation to the other teams. According to INS it has located the 72 case files to be reviewed for potential revocation. The INS review adjudicators decisions may not be the same as the decisions they might have made in their home units for various reasons such as multiple state penal codes with which the review adjudicators had little experience and criminal history records that had unclear descriptions of arrests and very often did not record the ultimate disposition of arrests. At the time of our review INS initially was not planning any further action to judge if the naturalization decisions for the 72 cases were appropriate thus leaving unresolved questions about the soundness of INS decisions in these cases. Although KPMG did not disclose its basis for this conclusion it seems reasonable to us that providing the EOIR staff with training similar to that provided to INS review adjudicators might have helped to reduce any differences in how the two groups reached their decisions.

The prior ATF policy was consistent with prior DEA and FBI policies in that they generally authorized the use of deadly force only when the agents reasonably believed or perceived that there was a threat or danger of death or serious bodily injury to the agent or another person. Detailed results and the scope and methodology of our review pertaining to ATFs OutofBusiness Records System are included in appendix V. The Gun Control Act requires federal firearms licensees to maintain records of firearms transactions and make these records available to ATF under certain circumstances. ATFs National Tracing Center NTC traces the ownership of firearms by using documentation such as outofbusiness licensee records which are maintained in ATFs data systems andor by contacting manufacturers importers wholesalers and retailers i.e. From fiscal years 1992 through 1995 ATF received a total of about 263000 trace requests. We concur with this conclusion.", "We further reported that the exact date and length of an outage may be difficult to determine from EIAs monthly refinery survey data making it difficult to use the data to determine whether a specific outage had a significant effect on the production capacity for some petroleum products as well as market prices. Unplanned outages on the other hand were associated with gasoline price increases but these increases were generally small and depended on key factors including whether or not the gasoline was branded or unbranded and the type of gasoline being sold. With respect to the distinction between branded and unbranded gasoline our analysis showed that in the event of an unplanned refinery outage unbranded gasoline was generally associated with greater wholesale price increases than branded gasoline. With regard to the type of gasoline fuel blend being sold our analysis shows that the price increases associated with an unplanned refinery outage were significantly greater for 8 of the 19 nonbasecase gasoline types we identified than our base case conventional clear gasoline while the price increases for other gasoline types were generally about the same as those of conventional gasoline. Existing federal data contain gaps that limit analyses of refinery outages on petroleum product prices and in some cases do not reflect emerging trendsalthough agencies continue to take steps to improve their data collection. Although we identified flow data collected at three agencies the data were of limited use because they did not show the volumetric entry flow and exit of specific petroleum products through the pipeline. Our analysis of gasoline sales data shows that from 2002 through 2008 conventional gasoline blended with ethanol had been sold in areas with no ethanol or other oxygenate mandates in at least 32 states. Agency and industry officials told us that as the volume of biofuels to be blended with gasoline continues to grow to 36 billion gallons in 2022 ethanol will increasingly be distributed in locations that do not have requirements for oxygenate content. Nonetheless in some cases the individual agency efforts have resulted in the collection of information that does not necessarily meet the data needs of other agencies or analysts who monitor petroleum product markets. To evaluate existing publicly held petroleum products market data and to determine if they are sufficient to meet the current and expected future missions and needs of the Congress federal agencies and other public and private stakeholders we recommend that the Administrator of the EIA convene a panel comprised of agency officials from EIA EPA DOT FERC and other relevant agencies industry representatives public stakeholders and other analysts and data users to collect these data and develop a coordinated interagency data collection strategy. Regarding our recommendations EIA stated that it supports the recommendations including our specific suggestions to review data adequacy strengthen interagency coordination of data collection and use and fully engage government industry and public stakeholders. To determine trends in refinery outages over the time period from 2002 through September 2008 we purchased data from Industrial Information Resources Inc. IIR that contained detailed information on refinery outages including the estimated dates of the outages whether the outages were planned or unplanned and the amount of reduced production capacity due to each outage. To evaluate how refinery outages have affected U.S. wholesale gasoline prices we obtained and analyzed data from Energy Information Administration EIAs monthly refinery production survey form EIA810 from 2002 through 2006 and other EIA surveys. This could affect the wholesale price of gasoline through changes in the availability of gasoline product. Our key outage effect variable measures the percent of a citys product supply affected by an outage that is where Outage r efinery that serves the ith city and the remaining term is the proportion of product provided by that refinery to that city. In the extreme case there may be a product due to s the impact on product of an outage at that refinery on that city would b large with a concomitant effect on that citys gasoline prices. Except for our weekly wholesale gasoline price data Geographic level of a but some of the data we used were at a more aggregated geographic leve We used capacity utilization and inventorysales ratio data at the PADD level. We assigned an effect of outage in the same time period week after which time our model implicitly assumed that the product was supplied from an alternate source.", "An organization that has these critical processes in place is in a better position to successfully invest in IT. Activities These are the key practices necessary to implement a critical process. According to INS it obligated about 18 million for ISIS in fiscal year 2000 to further deploy the system. According to INS CIS also interacts with various INS databases to provide the data necessary for INS operations. In accordance with the ITIM assessment method we rated a key practice as executed when we determined by consensus that INS was executing the key aspects of the practice. A critical process was rated as not implemented but improvements underway if over half but not all of its underlying key practices were rated as being executed. According to ITIM stage two maturity includes 1 defining IRB operations 2 developing a basic process for selecting new IT proposals 3 developing projectlevel investment control processes 4 creating an IT asset inventory and 5 identifying the business needs for each IT project. However INS has not yet developed some of the capabilities necessary to build a sound IT investment management process. Table 2 summarizes the ratings for each key practice and the specific findings supporting the ratings. INS is not effectively overseeing its IT projects. For example INS has not developed and maintained project management plans that include cost and schedule controls for each of its IT projects an SDLC requirement. In the absence of documented business needs the IRB cannot ensure that it is selecting IT investments that meet its mission needs and priorities. Portfolio selection criteria make up a necessary part of an IT investment management process. As mentioned previously INS has not developed selection criteria that include these elements nor has it ensured that cost benefit schedule and risk data are assessed and validated for each IT investment. According to ITIM effective portfolio performance oversight requires among other things that the IRB 1 have access to uptodate cost benefit schedule and risk data 2 monitor the performance of each investment in its portfolio by comparing actual projectlevel cost benefit schedule and risk data to the predefined expectations for the project and 3 correct poorly performing projects. Justice has not provided INS or any other Justice component sufficient direction guidance and oversight of IT investment management activities. The draft policy directs Justice components to establish and use an IT investment management process and directs the Justice CIO to monitor the components investment management processes through periodic briefings. Further Justice agreed with our recommendation for Justice to issue an investment management policy and guidance to its components including INS that 1 directs components to develop and implement IT investment management processes 2 instructs components on how to develop and implement these processes based on the investment management framework in our report and 3 ensures that components progress in doing so is monitored.", "If a lender does not have delegated authority ExIm performs its own underwriting procedures and approves the guaranteed loans. However the Manual did not adequately address the underwriting process in the following four areas 1 application screening 2 risk assessment and due diligence 3 credit structure and 4 credit decision. In its September 2013 report the IG recommended that ExIm update procedures for loan officers to maintain detailed documentation regarding the need for ExIm support. During our review of a sample of loan files we noted that certain approved transaction participants credit reports contained issues such as outstanding liens and poor credit history yet the loan files did not contain documentation that these issues were identified by the loan officers or how these issues were mitigated. However ExIm did not have a mechanism in place to verify that the country exposure and information in credit reports were considered and documented during the risk assessment and due diligence process prior to loan guarantee approval. To be eligible for ExIm financing exported goods and services must meet ExIms content requirements intended to ensure that U.S. jobs benefit from ExIm programs. Generally ExIms Manual provided loan officers with detailed guidance for determining and documenting key credit structure components financing terms and conditions including collateral requirementsof a loan guarantee transaction. For example procedures specific to aircraft transactions require an analysis of collateral and require that the ownership and condition of the collateral be maintained. ExIm used a riskbased approach to schedule delegated authority lender examinations to verify that approvals made under delegated authority were done according to ExIm standards. Detecting fraud is a potential outcome of the processes ExIm uses to monitor guaranteed loans as well as the steps it uses in its claims and recoveries process once a loan defaults. According to ExIm officials ExIms GC plays a role in fraud detection by collecting additional information on fraud concerns reported to GC by Ex Im staff and developing formal referrals to ExIms IG when additional information indicates that such action is warranted.explained that if a preliminary assessment suggests that a crime may have occurred they will make a formal referral to the IG. We recommend that the Chairman of the ExportImport Bank of the United States direct the appropriate officials to take the following six actions Develop and implement procedures prior to loan guarantee approval for 1 verifying that transaction applicants are not delinquent on federal debt including using credit reports to make such a determination and 2 performing assessments of collateral for nonaircraft medium and longterm loan guarantee transactions. Establish mechanisms to oversee compliance with ExIms existing procedures prior to loan guarantee approval for 1 obtaining credit reports for transaction borrowers or documenting why they were not applicable 2 documenting certain eligibility procedures including the Character Reputational and Transaction Integrity reviews for medium and longterm loan guarantee transactions export item eligibility and country eligibility and 3 documenting the analysis of country exposure. In its written comments ExIm described planned actions to address our recommendations. Medium and longterm loan guarantees. For this activity we evaluated the documentation related to financial risk factors and the commercial viability of the loan guarantee transaction. For longterm and aircraft loan guarantee transactions we tested to see if there was approval by an Ex Im loan officer an ExIm lawyer and the Vice President of Trade Finance on the credit memo. We also tested to see if the loan agreement was signed by all applicable parties and that the transaction was approved by the appropriate authority level.", "Longterm care insurance policies sold in the individual and group markets cover costs associated with long term care. For a specified premium amount that is designedbut not guaranteedto remain level over time the carrier agrees to provide covered benefits under an insurance contract. Carriers estimate the total amount of premiums to be collected for long term care insurance policies sold as well as projected claims and administrative costs for these policies using an anticipated lifetime loss ratio. Moreover of total premiums projected to be collected over the life of the coverage sold during the study period the federal program expected to pay a higher percentage in claim payments and a lower percentage in administrative costs compared with individual and group products. Benefits offered in the federal program and in the individual and group products we reviewed were covered by consumer protections required for HIPAA taxqualified plans. Table 2 summarizes the benefit options chosen by enrollees in the federal program and in individual and group products. Overall the average premium in the federal program for the three benefit packages for single people was 46 percent lower than average premiums for individual products we reviewed while premiums for married couples who were both the same age were 19 percent lower. When compared with premiums offered by CalPERS the only group product for which we had premium information average federal premiums were higher for two of the three packages. The employee participation rate in the Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program for active federal civilian employees was 5 percent comparable to the industry average in the group market but overall enrollment was lower than the expectations established by Partners. In the group market carriers typically target active employees who are younger than enrollees typically marketed to in the individual market. Enrollees in the federal program from these groups were 51 percent male and 49 percent female while the eligible population of all active federal employees active military members and active Postal Service employees was 67 percent male and 33 percent female. While the overall claims experience for the first 3 years was lower than expected the number of claims paid as a percentage of expected claims in each consecutive year of operation was higher than the previous year. Consistent with other longterm care insurance products the federal program expected most enrollees who averaged 56 years old when they enrolled to submit longterm care insurance claims in their mid70s to mid80sthe time when most claims are submitted. While the early claims experience of the federal program was considerably lower than initially projected before the program began an assessment of the claims submitted during the next several years and of other factors that affect the financial performance of the program will begin to provide a clearer picture of the longerterm implications. We asked Partners to provide annual premiums for a policy sold on March 31 2005 for enrollees in each of the four prepackaged benefit plans offered by the federal program with automatic compound inflation protection. To learn about longterm care insurance and to discuss the type of data we wanted to obtain through our data request we interviewed officials at OPM and Partners a CalPERS official and an official from the organization that administers the program and officials at five carriers that sold products in the individual markettwo of these carriers were also among the five largest carriers that sold products in the group market. The federal program included carecoordination benefits and coverage for international benefits and had no war exclusion. Federal program enrollees had several options for customizing benefits instead of choosing a prepackaged benefit plan.", "The Clean Water SRF program was established in 1987 under the Clean Water Act which was enacted to protect surface waters such as rivers lakes and coastal areas and to maintain and restore the physical chemical and biological integrity of these waters. First projects funded with Recovery Act SRF program funds had to be under contractready to proceed within 1 year of the acts passage or by February 17 2010. Third states had to use at least 50 percent of Recovery Act funds to provide additional subsidies for projects in the form of principal forgiveness grants or negative interest loans loans for which the rate of interest is such that the total payments over the life of the loans are less than the principal of the loans. In addition to programspecific provisions water projects receiving Recovery Act funds had to meet the acts Buy American and DavisBacon provisions. A significant aspect of accountability for Recovery Act funds is oversight of spending. As shown in figure 1 the states used the majority of their Recovery Act Clean Water SRF program funds to pay for secondary and advanced treatment at wastewater treatment plants as well as projects to prevent or mitigate sanitary sewer overflow. According to EPA data all states met the 20percent green requirement with 1.1 billion of total Clean Water SRF program funds going to green projects and 544 million of total Drinking Water SRF program funds going to green projects. The goal of supporting green projects is to promote green infrastructure energy or water efficiency and innovative ways to sustainably manage water resources. In the nine states we reviewed Recovery Act Clean and Drinking Water SRF funding has been used to address the major clean and drinking water problems in the state. In most of the nine states we reviewed compliance is a key aspect of their ranking system allowing points to be awarded to infrastructure projects that help the states eliminate causes of noncompliance with federal or state water quality standards and permits. Other states funded green projects ahead of higher ranked projects. State officials identified a few projects that did not proceed because potential subrecipients either did not want to meet one or more Recovery Act requirements such as the Buy American and DavisBacon provisions or did not want to increase the cost of their projects. Although the Recovery Act did not require states to target Clean and Drinking Water SRF program funds to economically disadvantaged communities six of the nine states that we reviewed distributed more than 123 million in clean water funds and eight of the nine states distributed almost 78 million in drinking water funds to these communities. Even with the additional subsidies available for projects officials in a few states said that small and economically disadvantaged communities found it difficult to obtain Recovery Act funds. To oversee Recovery Act projects and funds EPA developed an oversight plan as required by OMB. Our current work is showing that EPA and the states have made progress in implementing EPAs updated plan which included details on frequency content and documentation needed for regional reviews of state programs and state reviews of projects. Specifically in fiscal years 2010 and 2011 the Clean and Drinking Water SRF programs were required to include green projects and additional subsidization provisions. As we discussed above under the green requirement in the Recovery Act in certain cases state officials said they had to choose between a green water project and a project that was otherwise ranked higher to address water quality problems.", "Consular officers at overseas posts are responsible for providing expeditious visa processing for qualified applicants while preventing the entry of those that are a danger to U.S. security interests or are likely to remain in the United States illegally. States Bureau of Consular Affairs develops policies and manages programs needed to administer and support visaprocessing operations at overseas posts and has direct responsibility for U.S.based consular personnel. Turnaround times for those who requested an appointment to apply for a visa reached as long as 20 days during busy periodstwice the length we noted in our 1992 report on visaprocessing backlogs. The consulate also began employing appointment delays as a disincentive to applying in person and to encourage applicants to apply for visas through the consulates travel agency programa technique that it considered to be more efficient. The Consul General in Brasilia said that as many as 10 visa applicants from the Sao Paulo consular district underwent the inconvenience of traveling to and applying for visas in Brasilia each day rather than in Sao Paulo because they had encountered delays and other difficulties in Sao Paulo. Inadequate consular staffing at overseas posts and other staffingrelated issues were identified as barriers to timely processing of visas by the majority of posts that we reviewed. Nineteen of the 26 consulates we reviewed reported staffing problems such as staffing gaps due to transfers of foreign service officers during peak periods or inadequate permanent staffing positions. At the time of our recent visit to Sao Paulo the nonimmigrant visa section had seven foreign service officer positions one of which was vacant. State has made a number of changes in an effort to improve its visaprocessing operations in recent years and some of these initiatives could help in overcoming barriers to timely visa issuance. State has improved computer and telecommunications systems and has other equipment upgrades underway some of which will help address visaprocessing problems. State has developed a consular staffing model based on visa work load and related information that it plans to use to help determine adequate consular staffing and to help identify personnel from surplus areas that could be moved to understaffed ones. More importantly according to consular officials the upgrades have resulted in better and more comprehensive information about applicants who might pose a security threat thus contributing to higher quality decisionmaking with respect to visa applications. This procedure requires an employee to ask an applicant a few questions and to quickly determine whether the applicant is clearly eligible to receive a visa or whether the applicant must be interviewed by an officer. On the other hand some highvolume posts that did not use appointment systems managed to keep the total turnaround time for processing visas under 7 business days even in periods of very high demand. According to Deputy Assistant Secretary for Visa Services State does not systematically compile information on visa processing turnaround times at overseas posts nor has it established formal timeliness standards for visa processing. Some consulates continue to experience backlogs in processing nonimmigrant visas. We believe that States improvement efforts need to be guided by formal timeliness standards for issuing nonimmigrant visas. Establishing such standards could assist in identifying backlogs putting State in a better position to determine the resources and actions needed to correct them.", "With the exception of three contracts an award fee provision was included to foster maximum contractor performance based upon the governments subjective evaluation of the contractors level of performance. The contract also includes incentives for the contractor to reduce costs. Bangor has used a multiple service contract for base operations support services since it was activated as a submarine base in 1976. Similarly Whiting Field meets its needs for base operations support through a single contract for multiple support services several contracts for specific services and the use of inhouse personnel. Services in the contract include waste water treatment pest control grounds maintenance hazardous materials management communications systems transportation and utilities services. The Small Business Administration Reauthorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 adds new provisions to section 15a of the Small Business Act which at the time of our work required federal agencies to consider the effect on small businesses when requirements currently being performed by small business are considered for consolidation. These commercial activities studies involved comparing estimated contract and inhouse costs for the specific work to be performed to determine the most costeffective approach. Officials stated that single contracts for multiple base operations services had some obvious efficiency gains that are not available under separate contracts such as reduced overhead cross utilizations of contract personnel and reduced solicitations. Single contracts for multiple services were one tool being used to meet base operations support needs at the 10 installations we reviewed. All of this suggests that multiple service contracts need to be tailored to the needs missions and other factors effecting individual installations. To ascertain the implications for small businesses when multiple service contracts are utilized we determined the extent to which small businesses were participating as prime contractors through discussions with contracting officials. According to contracting officials the decision to contract for base operations support services was part of an experiment to determine how well and efficiently a contractorrun base could operate compared to another base that used inhouse personnel to perform the services. According to contracting officials the multiple service contract resulted from a commercial activities study and provides supply civil engineering operations and transportation functions. Contracting officials at Fort Belvoir stated that Fort Belvoir uses other contracts for specific support services such as major road repairs asbestos removal and custodial services. The first contract was awarded in fiscal 1987 as the result of a commercial activities study. Such services as morale welfare and recreation environmental services aircraft operations public works engineering and housing are provided for through the use of inhouse personnel. The current multiple service contract was awarded to DayZimmerman on a fixedpriceawardfee basis and is worth about 15 million annually. Some of the base operations support services provided for in the multiple service contract include operating combined bachelors quarters public works custodial airfield management pest management transportation food services supply and housing operations."], "all_goldstandart": ["As the Department of Defense (DOD) has expanded its involvement in overseas military operations, it has grown increasingly reliant on its federal civilian workforce to support contingency operations. The Senate Armed Services Committee required GAO to examine DOD's policies concerning the health care for DOD civilians who deploy in support of contingency operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. GAO analyzed over 3,400 deployment-related records for deployed federal civilians and interviewed department officials to determine the extent to which DOD has established and the military services and defense agencies (hereafter referred to as DOD components) have implemented (1) force health protection and surveillance policies and (2) medical treatment policies and procedures for its deployed federal civilians. GAO also examined the differences in special pays and benefits provided to DOD's deployed federal civilians and military personnel. DOD has established force health protection and surveillance policies to assess and reduce or prevent health risks for its deployed federal civilian personnel, but it lacks procedures to ensure implementation. Our review of over 3,400 deployment records at eight component locations found that components lacked documentation that some federal civilian personnel who deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq had received, among other things, required pre- and post-deployment health assessments and immunizations. These deficiencies were most prevalent at Air Force and Navy locations, and one Army location. As a larger issue, DOD lacked complete and centralized data to readily identify its deployed federal civilians and their movement in theater, further hindering its efforts to assess the overall effectiveness of its force health protection and surveillance capabilities. In August 2006, DOD issued a revised policy which outlined procedures that are intended to address these shortcomings. However, these procedures are not comprehensive enough to ensure that DOD will know the extent to which its components are complying with existing health protection requirements. In particular, the procedures do not establish an oversight and quality assurance mechanism for assessing the implementation of its force health protection and surveillance requirements. Until DOD establishes a mechanism to strengthen its force health protection and surveillance oversight, it will not be effectively positioned to ensure compliance with its policies, or the health care and protection of deployed federal civilians. DOD has also established medical treatment policies for its deployed federal civilians which provide those who require treatment for injuries or diseases sustained during overseas hostilities with care that is equivalent in scope to that provided to active duty military personnel under the DOD military health system. GAO reviewed a sample of seven workers' compensation claims (out of a universe of 83) filed under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act by DOD federal civilians who deployed to Iraq. GAO found in three cases where care was initiated in theater, that the affected civilians had received treatment in accordance with DOD's policies. In all seven cases, DOD federal civilians who requested care after returning to the United States had, in accordance with DOD's policies, received medical examinations and/or treatment for their deployment-related injuries or diseases through either military or civilian treatment facilities. DOD provides certain special pays and benefits to its deployed federal civilians, which generally differ in type and/or amount from those provided to deployed military personnel. For example, both civilian and military personnel are eligible to receive disability benefits for deployment-related injuries; however, the type and amount of these benefits vary, and some are unique to each group. Further, while the survivors of deceased federal civilian and military personnel generally receive similar types of cash survivor benefits, the comparative amounts of these benefits differ.", "Business income taxes, both corporate and noncorporate, are a significant portion of federal tax revenue. Businesses also play a crucial role in collecting taxes from individuals, through withholding and information reporting. However, the design of the current system of business taxation is widely seen as flawed. It distorts investment decisions, hurting the performance of the economy. Its complexity imposes planning and record keeping costs, facilitates tax shelters, and provides potential cover for those who want to cheat. Not surprisingly, business tax reform is part of the debate about overall tax reform. The debate is occurring at a time when long-range projections show that, without a policy change, the gap between spending and revenues will widen. This testimony reviews the nation's long term fiscal imbalance and what is wrong with the current system of business taxation and provides some principles that ought to guide the debate about business tax reform. This statement is based on previously published GAO work and reviews of relevant literature. The size of business tax revenues makes them very relevant to any plan for addressing the nation's long-term fiscal imbalance. Reexamining both federal spending and revenues, including business tax policy and compliance must be part of a multipronged approach to address the imbalance. Some features of current business taxes channel investments into tax-favored activities and away from more productive activities and, thereby, reduce the economic well-being of all Americans. Complexity in business tax laws imposes costs of its own, facilitates tax shelters, and provides potential cover for those who want to cheat. IRS's latest estimates show a business tax gap of at least $141 billion for 2001. This in turn undermines confidence in the fairness of our tax system--citizens' confidence that their friends, neighbors, and business competitors pay their fair share of taxes. Principles that should guide the business tax reform debate include: (1) The proposed system should raise sufficient revenue over time to fund our current and future expected expenditures. (2) The tax base should be as broad as possible, which helps to minimize overall tax rates. (3) The proposed system should improve compliance rates by reducing tax preferences and complexity and increasing transparency. (4) To the extent other goals, such as equity and simplicity, allow, the tax system should aim for neutrality by not favoring some business activities over others. More neutral tax policy has the potential to enhance economic growth, increase productivity and improve the competitiveness of the U.S. economy in terms of standard of living. (5) The consideration of transition rules must be an integral part of any reform proposal.", "Medicare pays for surgical procedures performed at ambulatory surgical centers (ASC) and hospital outpatient departments through different payment systems. Although they perform a similar set of procedures, no comparison of ASC and hospital outpatient per-procedure costs has been conducted. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 directed GAO to compare the relative costs of procedures furnished in ASCs to the relative costs of those procedures furnished in hospital outpatient departments, in particular, how accurately the payment groups used in the hospital outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) reflect the relative costs of procedures performed in ASCs. To do this, GAO collected data from ASCs through a survey. GAO also obtained hospital outpatient data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). GAO determined that the payment groups in the OPPS, known as ambulatory payment classification (APC) groups, accurately reflect the relative cost of procedures performed in ASCs. GAO calculated the ratio between each procedure's ASC median cost, as determined by GAO's survey, and the median cost of each procedure's corresponding APC group under the OPPS, referred to as the ASC-to-APC cost ratio. GAO also compared the OPPS median costs of those same procedures with the median costs of their APC groups, referred to as the OPPS-to-APC cost ratio. GAO's analysis of the ASC-to-APC and OPPS-to-APC cost ratios showed that 45 percent of all procedures in the analysis fell within a 0.10 point range of the ASC-to-APC median cost ratio, and 33 percent of procedures fell within a 0.10 point range of the OPPS-to-APC median cost ratio. These similar patterns of distribution around the median show that the APC groups reflect the relative costs of procedures provided by ASCs as well as they reflect the relative costs of procedures provided in hospital outpatient departments and can be used as the basis for the ASC payment system. GAO's analysis also identified differences in the cost of procedures in the two settings. The median cost ratio among all ASC procedures was 0.39 and when weighted by Medicare claims volume was 0.84. The median cost ratio for OPPS procedures was 1.04. Thus, the cost of procedures in ASCs is substantially lower than the corresponding cost in hospital outpatient departments.", "In collecting taxes, processing returns, and providing taxpayer service, IRS relies extensively on computerized systems. Thus it is critical that sensitive taxpayer and other data are protected. Recent data breaches at IRS highlight the vulnerability of taxpayer information. In addition, identity theft refund fraud is an evolving threat to honest taxpayers and tax administration. This crime occurs when a thief files a fraudulent return using a legitimate taxpayer's identity and claims a refund. In 2015, GAO added identity theft refund fraud to its high-risk area on the enforcement of tax laws and expanded its government-wide high-risk area on federal information security to include the protection of personally identifiable information. This statement discusses (1) IRS information security controls over financial and tax processing systems, (2) IRS actions to address identity theft refund fraud, and (3) the status of selected IRS filing season operations. This statement is based on previously published GAO work as well as an update of selected data. In March 2016, GAO reported that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had instituted numerous controls over key financial and tax processing systems; however, it had not always effectively implemented other controls intended to properly restrict access to systems and information, among other security measures. In particular, while IRS had improved some of its access controls, weaknesses remained in key controls for identifying and authenticating users, authorizing users' level of rights and privileges, encrypting sensitive data, auditing and monitoring network activity, and physically securing facilities housing its information technology resources. These weaknesses were due in part to IRS's inconsistent implementation of its agency-wide security program, including not fully implementing prior GAO recommendations. GAO concluded that these weaknesses collectively constituted a significant deficiency for the purposes of financial reporting for fiscal year 2015. As a result, taxpayer and financial data continue to be exposed to unnecessary risk. Identity theft refund fraud also poses a significant challenge. IRS estimates it paid $3.1 billion in these fraudulent refunds in filing season 2014, while preventing $22.5 billion (see figure). The full extent is unknown because of the challenges inherent in detecting this form of fraud. IRS has taken steps to combat identity theft refund fraud such as improving phone service for taxpayers to report suspected identity theft and working with industry, states, and financial institutions to detect and prevent it. However, as GAO reported in August 2014 and January 2015, additional actions can further assist the agency in addressing this crime, including pre-refund matching of taxpayer returns with information returns from employers, and assessing the costs, benefits, and risks of improving methods for authenticating taxpayers. In addition, the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2016 includes a provision that would help IRS with pre-refund matching and also includes an additional $290 million to enhance cybersecurity, combat identity theft refund fraud, and improve customer service. According to IRS and industry partners, the 2016 filing season has generally gone smoothly, with about 95 million returns and $215 billion in refunds processed through April 1, 2016. In addition, IRS increased its level of phone service to taxpayers, although it has not developed a comprehensive strategy for customer service as GAO recommended in December 2015. In addition to 49 prior recommendations that had not been implemented, GAO made 45 new recommendations to IRS to further improve its information security controls and the implementation of its agency-wide information security program. GAO has also made recommendations to help IRS combat identity theft refund fraud, such as assessing costs, benefits, and risks of taxpayer authentication options.", "The Immigration and Naturalization's (INS) organizational structure has led to recurring management problems, including an inability to balance competing priorities, poor communications, and weaknesses in the development and fielding of critical information technology. Although restructuring may help, INS will still need to assemble the basic building blocks essential to any organization. These building blocks include clearly delineated roles and responsibilities, policies and procedures that effectively balance competing priorities, effective internal and external communication and coordination, and computer systems that provide accurate and timely information. Until these element are in place, it will be difficult to enforce the nation's immigration laws effectively.", "DOD defines emerging contaminants as chemicals or materials with (1) perceived or real threat to health or the environment and (2) lack of published standards or a standard that is evolving or being reevaluated. Two emerging contaminants--trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchlorate--are of particular concern to DOD because they have significant potential to impact people or DOD's mission. TCE, a degreasing agent in metal cleaning which has been used widely in DOD industrial and maintenance processes, has been documented at low exposure levels to cause headaches and difficulty concentrating. High-level exposure may cause dizziness, headaches, nausea, unconsciousness, cancer, and possibly death. Similarly, perchlorate has been used by DOD, NASA, and others in making, testing, and firing missiles and rockets. It has been widely found in groundwater, surface water, and soil across the United States, Perchlorate health studies have documented particular risks to fetuses of pregnant women. GAO was asked for testimony to summarize its past work on perchlorate-, TCE-, and defense-activities related to (1) the state of knowledge about the emerging contaminants TCE and perchlorate, (2) DOD responsibilities for managing TCE and perchlorate contamination at its facilities, and (3) DOD activities to address TCE and perchlorate contamination. While TCE and perchlorate are both classified by DOD as emerging contaminants, there are important distinctions in how they are regulated and in what is known about their health and environmental effects. Since 1989, EPA has regulated TCE in drinking water. However, health concerns over TCE have been further amplified in recent years after scientific studies have suggested additional risks posed by human exposure to TCE. Unlike TCE, no drinking water standard exists for perchlorate--a fact that has caused much discussion in Congress and elsewhere. Recent Food and Drug Administration data documenting the extent of perchlorate contamination in the nation's food supply has further fueled this debate. While DOD has clear responsibilities to address TCE because it is subject to EPA's regulatory standard, DOD's responsibilities are less definite for perchlorate due to the lack of such a standard. Nonetheless, perchlorate's designation by DOD as an emerging contaminant has led to some significant control actions. These actions have included responding to requests by EPA and state environmental authorities, which have used a patchwork of statutes, regulations, and general oversight authorities to address perchlorate contamination. Pursuant to its Clean Water Act authorities, for example, Texas required the Navy to reduce perchlorate levels in wastewater discharges at the McGregor Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant to 4 parts per billion (ppb), the lowest level at which perchlorate could be detected at the time. In addition, in the absence of a federal perchlorate standard, at least nine states have established nonregulatory action levels or advisories for perchlorate ranging from 1 ppb to 51 ppb. Nevada, for example, required the Kerr-McGee Chemical site in Henderson to treat groundwater and reduce perchlorate releases to 18 ppb, which is Nevada's action level for perchlorate. While nonenforceable guidance had existed previously, it was not until EPA adopted its 1989 TCE standard that many DOD facilities began to take concrete action to control the contaminant. According to EPA, for example, 46 sites at Camp Lejeune have since been identified for TCE cleanup. The Navy and EPA have selected remedies for 30 of those sites, and the remaining 16 are under active investigation. Regarding perchlorate, in the absence of a federal standard DOD has implemented its own policies on sampling and cleanup, most recently with its 2006 Policy on DOD Required Actions Related to Perchlorate. The policy applies broadly to DOD's active and closed installations and formerly used defense sites within the United States and its territories. It requires testing for perchlorate and certain cleanup actions and directs the department to comply with applicable federal or state promulgated standards, whichever is more stringent. The policy notes, that DOD has established 24 ppb as the current level of concern for managing perchlorate until the promulgation of a formal standard by the states and/or EPA.", "The cost of the nation's decennial census has steadily increased over the past 40 years; the 2010 Census was the most expensive to date, at about $13 billion. To achieve cost savings while still conducting an accurate count of the population, the U.S. Census Bureau is planning significant changes for the design of the 2020 Decennial Census, including major efforts to implement new technologies and IT systems supporting its surveys. For example, the Bureau is planning to offer an option for households to respond via the Internet, which requires developing new applications and IT infrastructure. This statement summarizes the critical challenges the Bureau faces in successfully delivering IT systems in time for testing redesigned 2020 Census operations. To develop this statement, GAO relied on previously published work, as well as information on steps the Bureau has taken to implement prior GAO recommendations. GAO has previously reported that the U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) faces a number of critical challenges in developing and deploying the information technology (IT) systems and infrastructure it plans to rely on to conduct the significantly redesigned 2020 Census. Specifically, the Bureau has a major IT program under way to modernize and consolidate the multiple, duplicative systems it currently uses to carry out survey data collection and processing functions; however, with less than 2 years before preparations begin for end-to-end testing of all systems and operations to ensure readiness for the 2020 Census, there is limited time to implement it. While the Bureau documented many key decisions about the redesigned 2020 Census in the 2020 Census Operational Plan, released in October 2015, several key IT-related decisions have not been made. Specifically, the Bureau has not yet made decisions about the projected demand that the IT infrastructure would need to meet or whether it will build or buy the needed systems. This lack of prioritization of IT decisions has been a continuing trend, which GAO has previously identified. For example: In April 2014, GAO reported that the Bureau had not prioritized key IT research and testing needed for its design decisions. Accordingly, GAO recommended that the Bureau prioritize its IT-related research and testing projects. The Bureau had taken steps to address this recommendation, such as releasing a plan in September 2014 that identified research questions intended to inform the operational design decisions. In February 2015, however, GAO reported that the Bureau had not determined how key IT research questions that were identified in the September 2014 plan would be answered\u2014such as the expected rate of respondents using its Internet response option or the IT infrastructure that would be needed to support this option. GAO recommended that the Bureau, among other things, develop methodologies and plans for answering key IT-related research questions in time to inform design decisions. However, this has not yet happened. In addition, while the Bureau has made improvements in some key IT management areas, it still faces challenges in the areas of workforce planning and information security. Specifically: It has taken steps to develop an enterprise-wide IT workforce planning process, as GAO recommended in 2012. However, the Bureau has yet to fill key positions. Most concerning, it is currently without a permanent chief information officer. The Bureau has taken steps to implement the majority of the 115 recommendations GAO made in 2013 to address information security weaknesses; however, completing this effort is necessary to ensure that sensitive information it will collect during the census is adequately protected. With the deferral of key IT-related decisions, the Bureau is running out of time to develop, acquire, and implement the systems it will need to deliver the redesign and achieve its projected $5.2 billion in cost savings. In its prior work, GAO made recommendations to the Census Bureau to prioritize IT testing and research and determine how key decisions for the 2020 Census were to be answered. GAO also made recommendations to improve IT management, workforce planning, and information security. The Bureau has taken steps to address selected recommendations, but more actions are still needed to fully address these recommendations.", "DOD manages conventional ammunition that ranges from small arms cartridges to rockets, mortars, artillery shells, and tactical missiles. When a military service determines such ammunition is beyond its needs, obsolete, or unserviceable, it is offered to the other services and if not taken, transferred to the Army, which manages the CAD stockpile and takes actions to demilitarize and dispose of the ammunition in the stockpile. According to data provided by DOD officials, as of February 2015, the stockpile was about 529,373 tons. DOD estimates that from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2020 it will add an additional 582,789 tons of conventional ammunition to this CAD stockpile. Section 352 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 included a provision that GAO review and report on the management of DOD's CAD stockpile. This report assesses, among other things, the extent to which DOD has adequately maintained and shared information on excess, obsolete, and unserviceable ammunition for the military services. GAO reviewed applicable guidance and the military service ammunition databases; visited an Army depot that conducts ammunition demilitarization; and interviewed appropriate DOD officials. The Department of Defense (DOD) maintains information on its excess, obsolete, and unserviceable conventional ammunition for the military services and shares this information on a limited basis with other government agencies, but its management of its conventional ammunition awaiting demilitarization and disposal (CAD) stockpile can be strengthened in two areas. The Army uses its Logistics Modernization Program database to maintain consolidated information on ammunition in the CAD stockpile, but GAO found that records for some items do not include complete data on weight. Specifically, of 36,355 records in the database, 2,829 did not have assigned weights as of February 2015. Internal control standards state that an entity should have controls to ensure that all transactions are complete and accurately recorded. DOD officials stated they are trying to correct current records with missing data; however, the number of records without weight data has increased. For example, as of February 2015, the number of records with missing data had increased by more than 600 since 2012. Since DOD uses weight in determining, among other things, cost estimates for demilitarization projects and what ammunition to demilitarize, missing weight data can negatively impact its efforts to destroy the most ammunition possible with the resources available. The military services have access to information on the CAD stockpile maintained in the Army's database and can search it for useable ammunition that could fill their requirements, but other government agencies do not and DOD does not have a systematic means for sharing such information. Federal internal control standards state that management should ensure there are adequate means of communicating with, and obtaining information from, external stakeholders. DOD officials told GAO that there have been instances of transfers of ammunition to other government agencies, but these have been done informally and on a limited basis. Without a systematic means for regularly sharing information on useable ammunition beyond DOD's needs, both DOD and other agencies may be missing opportunities to reduce costs related to demilitarization and ammunition procurement. GAO recommends DOD develop a plan to identify and record missing weight data and develop a systematic means to share information on the stockpile with other government agencies. DOD agreed with GAO's recommendations.", "Compliance agreements between the Department of Energy (DOE) and its regulators specify cleanup activities and milestones that DOE has agreed to achieve. The 70 compliance agreements at DOE sites vary, but can be divided into three main types. These are: (1) agreements specifically required by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 to address cleanup of federal sites on EPA's national priorities list or by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 to address the management of mixed radioactive and hazardous waste at DOE facilities; (2) court-ordered agreements resulting from lawsuits initiated primarily by states; and (3) other agreements, including state administrative orders enforcing state hazardous waste management laws. DOE reported completing about 80 percent of its milestones by the time originally scheduled in the agreements. The cost of complying with these agreements is not specifically identified in the DOE budget submitted to Congress. Individual DOE sites develop annual compliance cost estimates as part of their budget requests. However, DOE headquarters officials adjust those individual site estimates to reflect national priorities and to reconcile various competing demands. Compliance agreements are site-specific and are not intended to provide a mechanism for DOE to use in prioritizing risks among the various sites. Compliance agreements have not been a barrier to previous DOE management initiatives, but it is not clear if the compliance agreements will be used to oppose DOE's latest initiative to focus on accelerating risk reduction at sites.", "Parents have the legal responsibility to protect and care for their children. However, recent media reports have illuminated a practice involving unregulated custody transfers of adopted children. Commonly referred to as \u201crehoming,\u201d this practice involves parents who turn to the internet or other unregulated networks to find a new home for their child. These media reports found instances in which adopted children were placed in dangerous situations where they were harmed by the adults who received them. GAO was asked to review issues related to unregulated transfers of adopted children. GAO examined (1) the reasons adoptive families consider unregulated child custody transfers, and services that exist to support these families before they take such an action; (2) what is known about the prevalence of these transfers; and (3) actions selected states and federal agencies have taken to address such transfers. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and policies and selected state laws and proposed legislation. GAO also interviewed officials from federal agencies, 19 child welfare and adoption organizations, 15 adoption agencies, and 7 states selected primarily because of legislative activity on unregulated transfers. GAO also searched online activity on selected social media sites to find illustrative examples of families who may be considering unregulated transfers. The Departments of Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and State provided technical comments. The Department of Justice had no comments. Some adoptive families may consider giving their children to another family outside of the courts and child welfare system\u2014an \u201cunregulated child custody transfer\u201d\u2014because of a crisis within the adoptive family and difficulties accessing support services, according to officials GAO interviewed from selected states, child welfare and adoption organizations, and adoption agencies. Children adopted internationally or from foster care may need special care or counseling because of a history of institutionalization and trauma. Some parents, particularly those who adopted internationally, may not be prepared to deal with their adopted child's complex needs. Federal regulations require agencies facilitating international adoptions to provide parents with at least 10 hours of pre-adoption training. In contrast, about half of the states require agencies facilitating foster care adoptions to provide at least 27 hours of training, according to data obtained from Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) officials in May 2015. Many officials said adoptive parents may experience challenges finding mental health services for their families, such as therapists familiar with adoption issues. Many officials also said parents who adopt children with more severe needs may have difficulty finding and paying for intensive services such as residential treatment, which can cost thousands of dollars per month. Officials said these challenges may lead families to seek out unregulated transfers. Little is known about the prevalence of unregulated transfers. Because they happen without any oversight, these transfers are difficult to track and no federal agency keeps statistics on their occurrence. GAO's observations of social media sites found that some parents have been using online forums to seek new homes for their adopted children. During a 15-month period, GAO identified 23 instances in which a parent posted that they were seeking a new family for their child. Because GAO did not investigate these posts and because discussions between online participants can be continued privately, GAO was unable to determine whether these participants intended to pursue a legal placement or an unregulated transfer, or whether such a transfer actually took place. Selected states and federal agencies have taken some steps to address unregulated transfers. GAO identified at least 15 states in which there was legislative and other activity in recent years intended to address these transfers. Seven of the 15 states had enacted legislation and 3 made changes to state child welfare programs as of July 2015. The most common approaches were criminalizing unregulated transfers or actions that may lead to these transfers, and restricting the advertisement of children for placement. In addition, activity in several states involved improving post-adoption services, which many officials said was a key need for families who resort to unregulated transfers. However, federal officials and others said addressing service needs can be difficult and time-consuming, and funding for these services is limited. At the federal level, several agencies established an interagency working group on unregulated transfers in October 2013. Officials from the Department of State said they plan to revise international pre-adoption training requirements that may include an increased number of minimum hours. HHS issued a memorandum in May 2014 encouraging states to promote post-adoption services and to review their policies to address unregulated transfers.", "Faced with an increase in disability claims, the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) is hiring a large number of new claims processing staff. We were asked to determine: (1) What training is provided to new and experienced claims processors and how uniform is this training? (2) To what extent has VBA planned this training strategically, and how well is the training designed, implemented, and evaluated? and (3) To what extent is the performance management system for claims processors consistent with generally accepted practices? To answer the questions, GAO reviewed documents including VBA policies and training curricula; interviewed VBA central office officials; visited 4 of VBA's 57 regional offices, which were selected to achieve diversity in geographic location, number of staff, and officewide accuracy in claims processing; and compared VBA's training and performance management to generally accepted practices identified by GAO. VBA has a standardized training curriculum for new staff and a training requirement for all staff, but does not hold staff accountable for meeting this requirement. The curriculum for new staff includes what is referred to as centralized training and training at their home offices. All claims processors must complete 80 hours of training annually, which may cover a mix of topics identified centrally and by regional offices. Individual staff members face no consequences for failing to meet the training requirement, however, and VBA has not tracked training completion by individuals. It is implementing a new system that should provide this capacity. Although VBA has taken steps to plan its training strategically, the agency does not adequately evaluate training and may be falling short in training design and implementation. VBA has a training board that assesses its overall training needs. However, the agency does not consistently collect feedback on regional office training, and both new and experienced staff GAO interviewed raised issues with their training. Some new staff raised concerns about the consistency of training provided by different instructors and about the usefulness of an on-line learning tool. Some experienced staff believe that 80 hours of training annually is not necessary, some training was not relevant for them, and workload pressures impede training. The performance management system for claims processors generally conforms to GAO-identified key practices, but the formula for assigning overall ratings may prevent managers from fully acknowledging and rewarding staff for higher levels of performance. The system aligns individual and organizational performance measures and requires that staff be given feedback throughout the year. However, VBA officials raised concerns about the formula used to assign overall ratings. Almost all staff in the offices GAO visited were placed in only two of five overall rating categories, although managers said greater differentiation would more accurately reflect actual performance differences. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has not examined the ratings distribution, but acknowledges a potential issue with its formula and is considering changes.", "DOD offered health care to about 9.6 million eligible beneficiaries through TRICARE, which provides care through military treatment facilities and civilian providers. Because DOD determined that its approach for reimbursing SCHs (459 in 2014) based on their billed charges was inconsistent with TRICARE's governing statute to reimburse civilian providers in a manner similar to Medicare, it implemented revised rules in January 2014. House Report 113-446, which accompanied the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, included a provision for GAO to review issues related to the changes in TRICARE's reimbursement rules for SCHs. In this report, GAO examines (1) how TRICARE's revised reimbursement rules for SCHs compare to Medicare's reimbursement rules for these hospitals, and (2) the extent to which TRICARE's revised reimbursement rules for SCHs may have affected access to these facilities by servicemembers and their dependents. GAO reviewed federal laws and regulations as well as TRICARE and Medicare's rules for reimbursing SCHs. GAO analyzed fiscal year 2013 TRICARE claims data on SCH admissions and reimbursement amounts, and Medicare data on SCH net patient revenue and total discharges. GAO interviewed 10 SCHs with the highest number of TRICARE admissions or reimbursement amounts about access issues. GAO also interviewed officials from DOD and national health care associations and military beneficiary coalition groups. TRICARE's revised reimbursement rules for Sole Community Hospitals (SCHs), which provide health care in rural areas or where similar hospitals do not exist under certain criteria, approximate those for Medicare's. Specifically, both programs reimburse SCHs using the greater of either a cost-based amount or the allowed amount under a diagnostic-related-group-based payment system, although each program takes a different approach in implementing these methods. Each program also provides for reimbursement adjustments under specific circumstances. In order to minimize sudden significant reductions in SCHs' TRICARE reimbursements, the revised rules include a transition period during which an eligible SCH is reimbursed using a cost-based ratio that is reduced annually until it matches the SCH's Medicare cost-to-charge ratio, which is calculated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for each hospital. Under TRICARE's revised rules for SCHs, this cost-to-charge ratio will be multiplied by the hospitals' billed charges to determine their reimbursement amounts. Most SCHs\u2014about 74 percent\u2014qualified for a transition to their Medicare cost-to-charge ratios. Because most SCHs have just completed the first year of a multi-year transition, it is too early to determine the full effect of the revised reimbursement rules, including any impact on TRICARE beneficiaries' access to care at these hospitals. Nonetheless, early indications show that TRICARE beneficiaries have not experienced problems accessing inpatient care at these facilities. Specifically, Defense Health Agency (DHA) officials reported that they do not think access to inpatient care at SCHs will be an issue because hospitals that participate in the Medicare program are required to participate in the TRICARE program and serve its beneficiaries. Although some of them were not familiar with this requirement, officials from the 10 SCHs GAO interviewed with the highest number of TRICARE admissions, the highest reimbursement amounts, or both, stated that they provide care to all patients, including TRICARE beneficiaries. DHA officials also said that they track access issues pertaining to inpatient care at SCHs through concerns or complaints, and as of February 2015, they had not received any access complaints. They noted that they are still looking at ways to measure changes in access to care at these facilities and will likely focus on the 44 SCHs that had 100 or more TRICARE admissions. In addition, other stakeholders, including representatives of national health care associations and military beneficiary coalition groups, said that they are not aware of TRICARE beneficiaries having difficulty accessing care at SCHs. Moreover, in its analysis of available Medicare data for these facilities (427 of 459 SCHs), GAO found that overall TRICARE reimbursements for SCHs averaged less than 1 percent of SCHs' net patient revenue, with TRICARE beneficiaries making up just over 1 percent of their total discharges for fiscal year 2013. As a result, the impact of TRICARE's revised reimbursement rules may likely be small for most SCHs. GAO provided a draft of this report to the Department of Defense (DOD) for comment. DOD responded that it agreed with the report's findings and provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) collects health insurance payments, known as third-party collections, for veterans' health care conditions it treats that are not a result of injuries or illnesses incurred or aggravated during military service. In September 1999, VA adopted a new fee schedule, called \"reasonable charges,\" that it anticipated would increase revenues from third-party collections. In January 2003, GAO reported on VA's third-party collection efforts and problems in collections operations for fiscal year 2002 as well as VA's initiatives to improve collections (VA Health Care: Third-Party Collections Rising as VA Continues to Address Problems in Its Collections Operations, ( GAO-03-145 , Jan. 31, 2003)). GAO was asked to discuss its findings and update third-party collection amounts and agency plans to improve collections. VA's fiscal year 2002 third-party collections rose by 32 percent over fiscal year 2001 collections, to $687 million, and available data for the first half of fiscal year 2003 show that $386 million has been collected so far. The increase in collections reflects VA's improved ability to manage the larger billing volume and more itemized bills required under its new fee schedule. VA managers in three regional health care networks attributed billings increases to a reduction of billing backlogs and improved collections processes, such as better medical documentation prepared by physicians, more complete identification of billable care by coders, and more bills prepared per biller. Although collections are increasing, operational problems, such as missed billing opportunities, persist and continue to limit the amount VA collects. VA has been implementing the action items in its Revenue Cycle Improvement Plan of September 2001 that are designed to address operational problems, such as unidentified insurance for some patients, insufficient documentation of services for billing, shortages of billing staff, and insufficient pursuit of accounts receivable. VA reported in April 2003 that 10 of 24 action items are complete; 7 are scheduled for implementation by the end of 2003; and the remaining actions will begin in 2004 with full implementation expected in 2005 or 2006. These dates are behind VA's original schedule. In addition, the Chief Business Office, established in May 2002, has developed a new approach that combines the action items with additional initiatives. Given the growing demand for care, especially from higher-income veterans, it is important that VA resolve its operational problems and sustain its commitment to maximizing third-party collections. It is also important for VA to develop a reliable estimate of uncollected dollars and a complete measure of its collections costs. Without this information, VA cannot evaluate its effectiveness in supplementing its medical care appropriation with third-party dollars.", "If the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) were to lose its legislative protections today, its high level of debt and corresponding high financing costs would be a competitive challenge. This competitive challenge would be even greater if it were at the same time attempting to recover costs of deferred assets through rates. Despite having reduced its debt and deferred assets over the past three years, TVA still compares unfavorably to its likely competitors in these areas. In addition, TVA is revising its goals for reducing debt and deferred assets downward significantly. Whether or not the deferred assets will contribute to stranded costs that are recoverable from customers depends on the specific requirements of any legislation that might remove TVA's legislative protections and TVA's ability to retain its current competitive advantages in a restructured environment. In addition, the longer that TVA has to prepare for competition, the longer it will have to reduce debt and recover the costs of its deferred assets and position itself more competitively. Ultimately, TVA's ability to be competitive will depend on the future market price of power, which cannot be predicted with any certainty.", "This report focuses on the trends in federal procurement for small businesses during the 1990s. Some organizations that represent small businesses and others have expressed concerns over acquisition reforms in the mid-1990s that may have reduced the opportunities for small businesses to compete for federal government contracts. These reforms sought to streamline acquisition processes to help government acquire goods and services more efficiently. The reforms included provisions to facilitate greater use of some types of contracts. However, small business representatives believe that some of these reforms could make it difficult for small businesses to compete for federal contracts. For example, the Clinger-Cohen Act authorizes the use of multiagency contracts. These contracts could potentially consolidate agencies' requirements, which small businesses may not be able to meet. At the same time, some procurement reforms have benefited small businesses. The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, for example, increased the value of contracts set aside exclusively for small business participation. In addition, the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997 increased the percentage of federal contracts to be awarded to small businesses to 23 percent. Small Business Administration data indicate that federal agencies met the legislative goal for procurement from small businesses from fiscal years 1993 to 1999.", "Pursuant to a congressional request, GAO discussed its completed reviews of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), focusing on the: (1) reasons that states had for not spending all of their federal grant funds; (2) efforts of WIC agencies to improve access to WIC benefits for working women; and (3) various practices states use to lower the costs of WIC and ensure that the incomes of WIC applicants' meet the program's eligibility requirements for participation. GAO noted that: (1) states had unspent WIC funds for a variety of reasons; (2) in fiscal year 1996, these funds totalled about $121.6 million, or about 3.3 percent of that year's $3.7 billion WIC grant; (2) some of these reasons were associated with the way WIC is structured; (3) virtually all the directors of local WIC agencies report that their clinics have taken steps to improve access to WIC benefits for working women; (4) the two most frequently cited strategies are: (a) scheduling appointments instead of taking participants on a first-come, first-served basis; and (b) allowing a person other than the participant to pick up food vouchers or checks, as well as nutrition information, and to pass these benefits on to the participant; (5) the states are using a variety of cost containment initiatives that have saved millions of dollars annually for WIC and enabled more individuals to participate in the program; and (6) some of these initiatives include obtaining rebates on WIC foods, limiting participants' food choices to lowest-cost items, and limiting the number of stores that participate in WIC.", "The recent information security breach at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), in which personal data on millions of veterans were compromised, has highlighted the importance of the department's security weaknesses, as well as the ability of federal agencies to protect personal information. Robust federal security programs are critically important to properly protect this information and the privacy of individuals. GAO was asked to testify on VA's information security program, ways that agencies can prevent improper disclosures of personal information, and issues concerning notifications of privacy breaches. In preparing this testimony, GAO drew on its previous reports and testimonies, as well as on expert opinion provided in congressional testimony and other sources. For many years, significant concerns have been raised about VA's information security--particularly its lack of a robust information security program, which is vital to avoiding the compromise of government information, including sensitive personal information. Both GAO and the department's inspector general have reported recurring weaknesses in such areas as access controls, physical security, and segregation of incompatible duties. The department has taken steps to address these weaknesses, but these have not been sufficient to establish a comprehensive information security program. For example, it is still developing plans to complete a security incident response program to monitor suspicious activity and cyber alerts, events, and incidents. Without an established and implemented security program, the department will continue to have major challenges in protecting its information and information systems from security breaches such as the one it recently experienced. In addition to establishing robust security programs, agencies can take a number of actions to help guard against the possibility that databases of personally identifiable information are inadvertently compromised. A key step is to develop a privacy impact assessment--an analysis of how personal information is collected, stored, shared, and managed--whenever information technology is used to process personal information. In addition, agencies can take more specific practical measures aimed at preventing data breaches, including limiting the collection of personal information, limiting the time that such data are retained, limiting access to personal information and training personnel accordingly, and considering the use of technological controls such as encryption when data need to be stored on portable devices. When data breaches do occur, notification of those affected and/or the public has clear benefits, allowing people the opportunity to protect themselves from identity theft. Although existing laws do not require agencies to notify the public of data breaches, such notification is consistent with agencies' responsibility to inform individuals about how their information is being accessed and used, and it promotes accountability for privacy protection. That said, care is needed in defining appropriate criteria for triggering notification. Notices should be coordinated with law enforcement to avoid impeding ongoing investigations, and in order to be effective, notices should be easy to understand. Because of the possible adverse impact of a compromise of personal information, it is critical that people fully understand the threat and their options for addressing it. Strong leadership, sustained management commitment and effort, disciplined processes, and consistent oversight will be needed for VA to address its persistent, long-standing control weaknesses.", "Oil shale deposits in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming are estimated to contain up to 3 trillion barrels of oil--or an amount equal to the world's proven oil reserves. About 72 percent of this oil shale is located beneath federal lands, making the federal government a key player in its potential development. Extracting this oil is expected to require substantial amounts of water and could impact groundwater and surface water. GAO was asked to report on (1) what is known about the potential impacts of oil shale development on surface water and groundwater, (2) what is known about the amount of water that may be needed for commercial oil shale development, (3) the extent to which water will likely be available for commercial oil shale development and its source, and (4) federal research efforts to address impacts to water resources from commercial oil shale development. GAO examined environmental impacts and water needs studies and talked to Department of Energy (DOE), Department of the Interior (Interior), and industry officials. Oil shale development could have significant impacts on the quality and quantity of water resources, but the magnitude of these impacts is unknown because technologies are years from being commercially proven, the size of a future oil shale industry is uncertain, and knowledge of current water conditions and groundwater flow is limited. In the absence of effective mitigation measures, water resources could be impacted from ground disturbances caused by the construction of roads and production facilities; withdrawing water from streams and aquifers for oil shale operations, underground mining and extraction; and discharging waters produced from or used in operations. Estimates vary widely for the amount of water needed to commercially produce oil shale primarily because of the unproven nature of some technologies and because the various ways of generating power for operations use differing quantities of water. GAO's review of available studies indicated that the expected total water needs for the entire life cycle of oil shale production ranges from about 1 barrel (or 42 gallons) to 12 barrels of water per barrel of oil produced from in-situ (underground heating) operations, with an average of about 5 barrels, and from about 2 to 4 barrels of water per barrel of oil produced from mining operations with surface heating. Water is likely to be available for the initial development of an oil shale industry, but the size of an industry in Colorado or Utah may eventually be limited by water availability. Water limitations may arise from increases in water demand from municipal and industrial users, the potential of reduced water supplies from a warming climate, fulfilling obligations under interstate water compacts, and the need to provide additional water to protect threatened and endangered fishes. The federal government sponsors research on the impacts of oil shale on water resources through DOE and Interior. DOE manages 13 projects whose water-related costs total about $4.3 million, and Interior sponsored two water-related projects, totaling about $500,000. Despite this research, nearly all of the officials and experts that GAO contacted said that there are insufficient data to understand baseline conditions of water resources in the oil shale regions of Colorado and Utah and that additional research is needed to understand the movement of groundwater and its interaction with surface water. Federal agency officials also said they seldom coordinate water-related oil shale research among themselves or with state agencies that regulate water. Most officials noted that agencies could benefit from such coordination. GAO recommends that Interior establish comprehensive baseline conditions for water resources in oil shale regions of Colorado and Utah, model regional groundwater movement, and coordinate on water-related research with DOE and state agencies involved in water regulation. Interior generally concurred with GAO's recommendations.", "Pursuant to a congressional request, GAO reviewed the Department of the Treasury's actions during the 1995-1996 debt ceiling crisis, focusing on: (1) investments and redemptions in federal trust funds; and (2) the Treasury's restoration of fund losses. GAO found that: (1) during the 1995-1996 debt ceiling crisis, Treasury followed normal investment and redemption procedures for 12 of the 15 major government trust funds; (2) Treasury suspended normal investments and redemptions for the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Trust, Government Securities Investment (G-fund), and Exchange Stabilization Funds and took other actions to stay within the debt ceiling; (3) these actions were proper and consistent with the Secretary of the Treasury's legal authority; (4) as required, the Secretary of the Treasury determined in November 1995 that a debt issuance suspension period existed prior to exercising his authority; (5) Treasury redeemed $46 billion in Civil Service fund securities in November 1995 and February 1996 and suspended investment of $14 billion in fund receipts in December 1995; (6) Treasury exchanged about $8.6 billion in Civil Service fund securities for Federal Financing Bank (FFB) securities, which FFB then used to repay borrowings from the Treasury; (7) Treasury suspended some investments and reinvestments of G-fund receipts and maturing securities during the crisis; (8) on several occasions, Treasury did not reinvest some of the maturing securities held by the Exchange Stabilization Fund; (9) in March 1996, Treasury issued some securities that were temporarily exempt from the debt ceiling, which allowed it to pay $29 billion in social security benefits and invest $58.2 billion in fund receipts and maturing securities; (10) although the Treasury did not technically exceed the debt ceiling during the crisis, the government incurred about $138.9 billion in additional debt that normally would have been subject to the ceiling; (11) several Treasury actions resulted in interest losses to certain government trust funds; and (12) Congress raised the debt ceiling to $5.5 billion at the end of March 1996, and Treasury fully restored the Civil Service fund's and the G-fund's interest losses by June 1996, but it could not restore the Stabilization fund's interest loss without special legislation.", "The FCC is responsible for ensuring that the public knows when and by whom it is being persuaded. Requirements direct broadcasters to disclose when a group or individual has paid to broadcast commercial or political programming. Political advertising must also comply with requirements overseen by the FEC. Recognition of sponsored programming has become increasingly difficult because of new technologies and increased access to sponsored programming such as video news releases. GAO (1) describes requirements for sponsorship identification and federal election disclaimers and stakeholders' views of the requirements and (2) assesses how and to what extent FCC and FEC address complaints. To conduct the work, GAO reviewed relevant laws, guidance, and enforcement procedures, and interviewed agency officials and stakeholders about enforcement processes and actions. Sponsorship identification statutes and regulations, overseen by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), require broadcasters to identify commercial content--usually an advertisement, an embedded advertisement, or a video news release--that has been broadcast in exchange for payment or other consideration. A written or verbal sponsorship announcement must be made at least once during any sponsored commercial content except when the sponsor is obvious. For content considered political or that discusses a controversial issue, broadcasters must follow all requirements for commercial content and additional requirements, such as identifying officials associated with the entity paying for an advertisement. In addition, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) enforces federal election law that requires all political communications for a federal election, including television and radio advertisements, to include a disclaimer statement. FEC also oversees requirements to report campaign funding and expenditures, including funding for political advertising. FCC has guidance that helps broadcasters determine when a sponsorship announcement is needed, such as when a deejay receives a payment for airing specific content. While broadcasters consider this guidance useful, it addresses older technology that in some cases is no longer used. Furthermore, some broadcasters indicated that it would be helpful for FCC to clarify how the guidance applies in some situations, such as when a video news release or product is used during programming. According to FCC, it opened 369 sponsorship identification cases representing just over 1 percent of the Investigations and Hearings Division's total cases opened from the beginning of 2000 through 2011. In 22 of these cases, FCC issued enforcement actions with varying types of violations and enforcement actions. While FCC follows standard procedures when addressing complaints, it does not inform the broadcaster named in the complaint of the outcome of the investigation in many cases. Most broadcasters we spoke with confirmed that FCC does not inform them of the status of investigations, and some indicated they currently do not know the status of several investigations. According to FCC, it does not communicate status with broadcasters named in complaints because, among other reasons, it has no legal obligation to do so. Broadcasters reported the lack of information about cases and FCC decisions creates uncertainty about the propriety of their past actions. As a result broadcasters might not have sufficient information to determine whether they should modify their practices. This can result in stations' editing content because of unwritten regulatory policy or what they assume the policy to be. Moreover, these investigations can be lengthy, taking from 10 months to over 5 years to complete when an enforcement action is involved. From 2000 through May 2012, FEC opened 301 cases based on complaints alleging violations of political advertisement disclaimer requirements. FEC assessed civil penalties in 29 cases, 7 of which were related to television or radio advertisement disclaimers. Unlike FCC, FEC provides status updates to those involved in investigations and issues reports explaining investigation findings. FEC also issues reports explaining case dismissals. These reports can clarify acceptable and unacceptable practices for the regulated community. FCC should, among other things, update its sponsorship identification guidance and consider providing additional examples relevant to more modern issues and communicate the resolution of an investigation to the target of the investigation when a letter of inquiry has been sent, and develop goals for resolving all sponsorship identification cases within a specified time frame. GAO provided FCC and FEC with a draft of this report. FCC indicated it will consider the recommended actions and how to address the concerns discussed in the report. Both FCC and FEC provided technical comments.", "USPS\u0092s declining revenues have become insufficient to cover its costs. Its strategies to address losses include reducing hours of service at many post offices and expanding the use of post office alternatives, including CPUs.CPUs are independent businesses compensated by USPS to sell most of the same products and services as post offices at the same price. Although CPUs can provide important benefits, the number of CPUs has fallen from 5,290 in fiscal year 2002 to 3,619 in fiscal year 2011. As requested, this report discusses: (1) how CPUs supplement USPS\u0092s post office network, (2) USPS\u0092s revenue from CPUs and compensation to them from fiscal years 2007 to 2011, and (3) challenges USPS might face if it increases its use of CPUs. GAO analyzed USPS data on CPU locations, revenues, compensation, and hours of operation as well as on post office locations and hours of operation. GAO interviewed CPU owners and USPS staff in charge of managing CPUs. Although contract postal units (CPUs) have declined in number, their nationwide presence in urban and rural areas supplements the U.S. Postal Service's (USPS) network of post offices by providing additional locations and hours of service. More than 60 percent of CPUs are in urban areas where they can provide customers nearby alternatives for postal services when they face long lines at local post offices. Over one-half of CPUs are located less than 2 miles from the nearest post office. Urban CPUs are, on average, closer to post offices than rural CPUs. CPUs are also sometimes located in remote or fast-growing areas where post offices are not conveniently located or may not be cost effective. CPUs further supplement post offices by providing expanded hours of service. On average, CPUs are open 54 hours per week, compared to 41 hours for post offices. In addition, a greater proportion of CPUs than post offices are open after 6 p.m. and on Sundays. These factors are important as USPS considers expanding the use of post office alternatives to cut costs and maintain access to its products and services. Total USPS revenues from CPUs fell from fiscal years 2007 to 2011, while USPS's compensation to them increased during this period; nonetheless, CPUs generated high revenues relative to USPS's compensation to CPUs. Declines in mail volumes and the number of CPUs drove revenues down 9 percent, from $672 million to $611 million from fiscal years 2007 to 2011. USPS total compensation to CPUs increased 6 percent during this period, from $76 million to $80 million; however, after increasing from fiscal year 2007 to 2008, compensation decreased every fiscal year from 2008 to 2011. According to USPS officials, the overall increase was because of increased compensation to individual CPUs and decreasing numbers of less expensive CPUs. In fiscal year 2011, after compensating CPUs, USPS retained 87 cents of every dollar of CPU revenue. USPS has a target to retain 80 cents for every dollar in revenue for individual CPUs. USPS did not meet this target at many individual CPUs-- especially ones in rural areas. In fact, 49 percent of CPUs that USPS compensates a fixed amount regardless of their sales in small-town rural areas-- where CPUs may serve as the de facto post office--generated less postal revenue than the CPUs received in compensation from USPS. CPU revenues and compensation are important factors as USPS seeks a more sustainable cost structure. Limited interest from potential partners, competing demands on USPS staff resources, and changes to USPS's retail network may pose challenges to USPS's use of CPUs. USPS has no current plans to strategically increase the number of CPUs as part of its retail network transformation. However, a number of district USPS staff charged with identifying the need for CPUs told us they see a larger role for CPUs. Nevertheless, USPS may face limited interest from potential partners as many may not want to operate CPUs because of concerns over CPU contract requirements such as space requirements and prohibitions on selling products and services that compete with USPS. Many USPS district retail managers we spoke with in charge of opening CPUs said that finding partners to operate CPUs could be difficult. Furthermore, many of these managers said that they now have fewer staff and less time and, as a result, do not have the resources to manage opening CPUs to meet the need they have identified. GAO previously recommended that USPS develop and implement a plan to modernize its retail network. GAO is not making any new recommendations at this time, but believes that it is important for USPS to consider the role of CPUs as USPS works to develop and implement its retail network plan and control costs. In commenting on a draft of this report, USPS provided information on its efforts to provide convenient access to its products and services.", "The Department of Housing and Urban Development\u0092s (HUD) Housing Choice Voucher (voucher) program subsidizes private-market rents for approximately 2 million low-income households. HUD pays a subsidy that generally is equal to the difference between the unit\u0092s rent and 30 percent of the household\u0092s income. HUD also pays an administrative fee, based on a formula, to more than 2,400 local housing agencies to manage the program. Over time, program expenditures steadily have risen, causing some to questionhow well HUD managed costs and used program resources. This report (1) discusses the key drivers of cost growth in the voucher program and the actions taken to control this growth and (2) analyzes various options to cut costs or create efficiencies. For this report, GAO analyzed HUD data; reviewed budget documents, program laws and regulations, guidance, academic and industry studies, and GAO reports; and interviewed officials from HUD, industry groups, and 93 housing agencies. Several factors\u0097including rising rents, declining household incomes, and decisions to expand the number of assisted households\u0097were key drivers of the approximately 29 percent increase (before inflation) in housing agencies\u0092 expenditures for the voucher program between 2003 and 2010. Congress and HUD have taken steps to limit cost increases while maintaining assistance for existing program participants. For example, Congress moved away from providing funding to housing agencies based on the number of voucher-assisted households they were authorized to subsidize and instead provided funding based on the generally lower number of voucher-assisted households housing agencies actually subsidized in the prior year. Further, HUD has proposed administrative relief and program flexibility for housing agencies, including streamlining program requirements and reducing subsidies paid. GAO identified several additional options that, if implemented effectively, could substantially reduce the need for new appropriations, cut costs (expenditures), or increase the number of households assisted. Reduce housing agencies subsidy reserves. Housing agencies have accumulated approximately $1.8 billion in subsidy reserves (unspent funds). They can hold the funds in reserve or spend them on authorized program expenses in future years. Over time, large sums can accumulate. Although HUD has sought the authority to offset (reduce) its future budget requests by the amount of \u0093 excess\u0094 subsidy reserves, it has not provided Congress with complete or consistent information on how much of these reserve funds housing agencies should retain for contingencies. GAO has highlighted the importance of providing clear and consistent information on housing agencies\u0092 reserves to Congress so it can make informed funding decisions. Implement administrative reform. HUD officials have noted that certain requirements for administering the voucher program are burdensome and costly and could be streamlined. In addition, the formula HUD uses to pay administrative fees to housing agencies is not tied to current administrative costs or requirements. HUD has an administrative fee study underway, which intends to identify specific reforms to ease administrative burden, increase efficiencies, and suggest ways to align the administrative fee formula with the functions housing agencies perform. Without this information, Congress may not have the information necessary to make fully informed policy and funding decisions related to the voucher program. Implement rent reform and consolidate voucher administration. Rent reform (for example, reducing subsidies by requiring households to pay more toward rent) and consolidation of program administration under fewer housing agencies could yield substantial cost savings\u0097approaching $2 billion\u0097or allow housing agencies to serve additional households, provided annual savings were reinvested in the program. However, while these options may have some advantages over the current program structure, they would require policymakers to consider some potential trade-offs, including increased rent burdens for low-income households, increased concentration of assisted households in high poverty areas, and more limited local control over voucher programs. GAO identifies options for increasing efficiencies and recommends that HUD (1) determine what level of reserve funding housing agencies should maintain and reduce future budget requests by the amount of excess reserves and (2) consider proposing options for simplifying program administration and changes to the administrative fee formula. HUD did not agree or disagree with the recommendations. While it noted that the draft provided an accurate assessment, it offered some clarifications and responses.", "The Unemployment Insurance (UI) program is a federal-state partnership to help replace the lost earnings of unemployed persons and to stabilize the economy during a recession. The Department of Labor estimates that $2.4 billion in overpayments were made in 2001, including $577 million attributed to fraud or abuse. Overpayments in the UI program result from management and operational practices at the state and federal level. At the state level, many states do not sufficiently balance the need to quickly process and pay UI claims with the need to control program payments. Moreover, states rely heavily on self-reported information from claimants for other important data, such as a claimant's receipt of other federal or state program benefits and whether they are citizens of the United States. At the federal level, policies and directives from the Department of Labor affect states' priorities and procedures in a manner that makes overpayments more likely.", "Pursuant to a congressional request, GAO reviewed the Forest Service's issuance of rights-of-way on national forest lands, focusing on: (1) whether the fees collected for rights-of-way reflect fair market value; (2) how Forest Service fees compare with fees charged by private landowners; and (3) the changes needed to ensure that Forest Service fees reflect fair market value. GAO found that: (1) Forest Service fees for rights-of-way for oil and gas pipelines, power lines, and communications lines are typically below fair market value; (2) Forest Service fees for rights-of-way are generally less than those charged by nonfederal landowners; (3) options available to the Forest Service for revising its fee determination system include using a new fee schedule based on recent appraisals and local market data, using a new fee schedule with the flexibility to disregard it when its fees are below fair market value, and using site-specific appraisals only; and (4) many rights-of-way users would be willing to pay fair market value for Forest Service rights-of-ways if the Forest Service would improve the administration of its rights-of-way program.", "UASs are aircraft that do not carry a pilot aboard, but instead operate on pre-programmed routes or are manually controlled by following commands from pilot-operated ground control stations. Unauthorized UAS operations have, in some instances, compromised safety. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 directed FAA to take actions to safely integrate UASs into the national airspace. In response, FAA developed a phased approach to facilitate integration and established test sites among other things. GAO was asked to review FAA's progress in integrating UASs. This report addresses (1) the status of FAA's progress toward safe integration of UASs into the national airspace, (2) research and development support from FAA's test sites and other resources, and (3) how other countries have progressed toward UAS integration into their airspace for commercial purposes. GAO reviewed and analyzed FAA's integration- planning documents; interviewed officials from FAA and UAS industry stakeholders; and met with the civil aviation authorities from Australia, Canada, France, and the United Kingdom. These countries were selected based on several factors including whether they have regulatory requirements for commercial UASs, operations beyond the view of the pilot, and whether non-military UAS are allowed to operate in the airspace. In comments on this report, the Department of Transportation noted that GAO did not address environmental considerations of UAS integration; such considerations were outside the scope of this report. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has progressed toward its goal of seamlessly integrating unmanned aerial system (UAS) flights into the national airspace. FAA has issued its UAS Comprehensive Plan and UAS Integration Roadmap , which provide broad plans for integration. However, according to FAA, it is working with MITRE to develop a foundation for an implementation plan; FAA then expects to enact a plan by December 2015. While FAA still approves all UAS operations on a case-by-case basis, in recent years it has increased approvals for UAS operations. Specifically, the total number of approvals for UAS operations has increased each year since 2010, and over the past year has included approvals for commercial UAS operations for the first time. In addition, FAA has issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that proposes regulations for small UASs (less than 55 pounds). The FAA's six designated test sites have become operational but have had to address various challenges during the process. The designated test sites became operational in 2014, and as of March 2015, over 195 test flights had taken place. These flights provide operations and safety data to FAA in support of UAS integration. In addition, FAA has provided all test sites with a Certificate of Waiver or Authorization allowing small UAS operations below 200 feet anywhere in the United States. However, during the first year of operations, the test sites faced some challenges. Specifically, the test sites sought additional guidance regarding the type of research they should conduct. According to FAA, it cannot direct the test sites, which receive no federal funding, to conduct specific research. However, FAA did provide a list of potential research areas to the test sites to provide some guidance on areas for research. FAA has conducted other UAS research through agreements with MITRE and some universities, and in May 2015 named the location of the UAS Center of Excellence\u2014a partnership among academia, industry, and government conducting additional UAS research. Unlike FAA's agreements with the test sites, many of these arrangements have language specifically addressing the sharing of research and data. Around the world, countries have been allowing UAS operations in their airspace for purposes such as agricultural applications and aerial surveying. Unlike in the United States, countries GAO examined\u2014Australia, Canada, France, and the United Kingdom\u2014have well-established UAS regulations. Also, Canada and France currently allow more commercial operations than the United States. While the United States has not finalized UAS regulations, the provisions of FAA's proposed rules are similar to those in the countries GAO examined. However, FAA may not issue a final rule for UASs until late 2016 or early 2017, and rules in some of these countries continue to evolve. Meanwhile, unlike under FAA's proposed rule, Canada has created exemptions for commercial use of small UASs in two categories that allow operations without a government-issued certification, and France and Australia are approving limited beyond line-of-sight operations. Similar to the United States, other countries are facing technology shortfalls, such as the ability to detect and avoid other aircraft and obstacles, as well as unresolved issues involving limited spectrum that limit the progress toward full integration of UASs into the airspace in these countries.", "GAO has designated Medicare as a high-risk program, in part because the program's size and complexity make it vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse. In 2013, Medicare financed health care services for approximately 51 million individuals at a cost of about $604 billion. The deceptive nature of fraud makes its extent in the Medicare program difficult to measure in a reliable way, but it is clear that fraud contributes to Medicare's fiscal problems. More broadly, in fiscal year 2013, CMS estimated that improper payments\u2014some of which may be fraudulent\u2014were almost $50 billion. This statement focuses on the progress made and important steps to be taken by CMS and its program integrity contractors to reduce fraud in Medicare. These contractors perform functions such as screening and enrolling providers, detecting and investigating potential fraud, and identifying improper payments and vulnerabilities that could lead to payment errors. This statement is based on relevant GAO products and recommendations issued from 2004 through 2014 using a variety of methodologies. In April 2014, GAO also received updated information from CMS on its actions related to the laws, regulations, and guidance discussed in this statement. Additionally, GAO updated information by examining public documents and relevant policies and procedures. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that oversees Medicare\u2014has made progress in implementing several key strategies GAO identified in prior work as helpful in protecting Medicare from fraud; however, important actions that could help CMS and its program integrity contractors combat fraud remain incomplete. Provider Enrollment : The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) authorized, and CMS has implemented, actions to strengthen provider enrollment that address past weaknesses identified by GAO and HHS's Office of Inspector General. For example, CMS has hired contractors to determine whether providers and suppliers have valid licenses and are at legitimate locations. CMS also recently contracted for fingerprint-based criminal history checks for high-risk providers and suppliers. CMS could further strengthen provider enrollment by issuing a rule to require additional provider and supplier disclosures of information and establishing core elements for provider and supplier compliance programs, as authorized by PPACA. Prepayment and Postpayment Claims Review : Medicare uses prepayment review to deny claims that should not be paid and postpayment review to recover improperly paid claims. GAO has found that increased use of prepayment edits could help prevent improper Medicare payments. For example, prior GAO work identified millions of dollars of payments inconsistent with selected coverage and payment policies and therefore improper. Postpayment reviews are also critical to identifying and recouping payments. GAO recommended better oversight of both the information systems analysts use to identify claims for postpayment review, in a 2011 report, and the contractors responsible for these reviews, in a 2013 report. CMS has addressed some of these recommendations. Addressing Identified Vulnerabilities : Having mechanisms in place to resolve vulnerabilities that could lead to improper payments is critical to effective program management and could help address fraud. However, GAO work has shown weaknesses in CMS's processes to address such vulnerabilities, placing the Medicare program and its beneficiaries at risk. For example, GAO has made multiple recommendations to CMS to remove Social Security numbers from beneficiaries' Medicare cards to help prevent identity theft, and, while HHS agreed with these recommendations, the department also reported that CMS could not proceed with the changes for a variety of reasons, including funding limitations. Thus, to date, CMS has not taken action on these recommendations. GAO has work underway addressing these key strategies, including assessing the potential use of electronic-card technologies to help reduce Medicare fraud. GAO is also examining the extent to which CMS's information system can prevent and detect the continued enrollment of ineligible or potentially fraudulent providers in Medicare. Additionally, GAO is studying CMS's oversight of program integrity efforts for prescription drugs and is examining CMS's oversight of some of the contractors that conduct reviews of claims after payment. These studies are focused on additional actions for CMS that could help the agency more systematically reduce potential fraud in the Medicare program.", "The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and foreign tax administrators face similar issues regardless of the particular provisions of their laws. These issues include, for example, helping taxpayers prepare and file returns, and assuring tax compliance. Understanding how other tax administrators have used certain practices to address common issues can provide insights to help inform deliberations about tax reform and about possible administrative changes in the U.S. existing system to improve compliance, better serve taxpayers, reduce burdens, and increase efficiencies. GAO was asked to describe (1) how foreign tax administrators have approached issues that are similar to those in the U.S. tax system and (2) whether and how the IRS identifies and adopts tax administration practices used elsewhere. To do this, GAO reviewed documents and interviewed six foreign tax administrators. In some cases, GAO also interviewed tax experts, tax practitioners, taxpayers, and trade-group representatives who were selected based on their expertise or involvement in developing or using the foreign systems. GAO also examined documents and met with IRS officials. Foreign and U.S. tax administrators use many of the same practices such as information reporting, tax withholding, providing Web-based services, and finding new approaches for tax compliance. These practices, although common to each system, have important differences. Although differences in laws, culture, or other factors likely would affect the transferability of foreign tax practices to the United States, these practices may provide useful insights for policymakers and the IRS. For example, New Zealand integrates evaluations of its tax and discretionary spending programs. The evaluation of its Working For Families tax benefits and discretionary spending, which together financially assist low- and middle-income families to promote employment, found that its programs aided the transition to employment but that it still had an underserved population; these findings likely would not have emerged from separate evaluations. GAO previously has reported that the United States lacks clarity on evaluating tax expenditures and related discretionary spending programs and does not generally undertake integrated evaluations. In Finland, electronic tax administration is part of a government policy to use electronic services to lower the cost of government and encourage private-sector growth. Overall, according to Finnish officials, electronic services have helped to reduce Tax Administration staff by over 11 percent from 2003 to 2009 while improving taxpayer service. IRS officials learn about these practices based on interactions with other tax administrators and participation in international organizations, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. In turn, the IRS may adopt new practices based on the needs of the U.S. tax system. For example, in 2009, the IRS formed the Global High Wealth Industry program. The IRS consulted with Australia about its approach and operational practices. GAO makes no recommendations in this report.", "The Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) was established under the Capital Assistance Program (CAP)--a component of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)--to assess whether the 19 largest U.S. bank holding companies (BHC) had enough capital to withstand a severe economic downturn. Led by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), federal bank regulators conducted a stress test to determine if these banks needed to raise additional capital, either privately or through CAP. This report (1) describes the SCAP process and participants' views of the process, (2) assesses SCAP's goals and results and BHCs' performance, and (3) identifies how regulators and the BHCs are applying lessons learned from SCAP. To do this work, GAO reviewed SCAP documents, analyzed financial data, and interviewed regulatory, industry, and BHC officials. The SCAP process appeared to have been mostly successful in promoting coordination, transparency, and capital adequacy. The process utilized an organizational structure that facilitated coordination and communication among regulatory staff from multiple disciplines and organizations and with the BHCs. Because SCAP was designed to help restore confidence in the banking industry, regulators took unusual steps to increase transparency by releasing details of their methodology and sensitive BHC-specific results. However, several participants criticized aspects of the SCAP process. For example, some supervisory and bank industry officials stated that the Federal Reserve was not transparent about the linkages between some of the test's assumptions and results. But most of the participants in SCAP agreed that despite these views, coordination and communication were effective and could serve as a model for future supervisory efforts. According to regulators, the process resulted in a methodology that yielded credible results. By design, the process helped to ensure that BHCs would be capitalized for a potentially more severe downturn in economic conditions from 2009 through 2010. SCAP largely met its goals of increasing the level and quality of capital held by the 19 largest U.S. BHCs and, more broadly, strengthening market confidence in the banking system. The stress test identified 9 BHCs that met the capital requirements under the more adverse scenario and 10 that needed to raise additional capital. Nine of the 10 BHCs were able to raise capital in the private market, with the exception of GMAC LLC, which received additional capital from the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury). The resulting capital adequacy of the 19 BHCs has generally exceeded SCAP's requirements, and two-thirds of the BHCs have either fully repaid or begun to repay their TARP investments. Officials from the BHCs, credit rating agencies, and federal banking agencies indicated that the Federal Reserve's public release of the stress test methodology and results in the spring of 2009 helped strengthen market confidence. During the first year of SCAP (2009), overall actual losses for these 19 BHCs have generally been below GAO's 1-year pro rata loss estimates under the more adverse economic scenario. Collectively, the BHCs experienced gains in their securities and trading and counterparty portfolios. However, some BHCs exceeded the GAO 1-year pro rata estimated 2009 losses in certain areas, such as consumer and commercial lending. Most notably, in 2009, GMAC LLC exceeded the loss estimates in multiple categories for the full 2-year SCAP period. More losses in the residential and commercial real estate markets and further deterioration in economic conditions could challenge the BHCs, even though they have been deemed to have adequate capital levels under SCAP. This report recommends that the Federal Reserve complete a final 2-year SCAP analysis, and apply lessons learned from SCAP to improve transparency of bank supervision, examiner guidance, risk identification and assessment, and regulatory coordination. The Federal Reserve agreed with our five recommendations and noted current actions that it has underway to address them. Treasury agreed with the report's findings.", "Pursuant to a congressional request, GAO provided information on alleged misconduct by Internal Revenue Service (IRS) employees in their treatment of other IRS employees and taxpayers, focusing on: (1) the specific allegations made at the Senate Committee on Finance hearings; and (2) any underlying systemic or programmatic problems that need to be resolved to protect the rights of taxpayers and IRS employees. GAO noted that: (1) available data showed significant differences between Senior Executive Service and line staff disciplinary cases in terms of dispositions and processing times; (2) IRS found that actions taken against lower-level employees more closely conformed to its established table of penalties than actions taken against higher-graded employees; (3) regarding the allegation that the Deputy Commissioner delayed action on senior manager misconduct cases until the managers were eligible to retire, GAO focused on actual retirements and did not reach general conclusions about eligibility to retire; (4) GAO found no cases in which an individual who was ineligible to retire when an allegation was filed, retired while the case was pending with the Deputy Commissioner; (5) GAO could not determine the extent of reprisal against whistleblowers because IRS did not track whistleblowing reprisal cases; (6) regarding allegations of IRS retaliation against taxpayers, GAO previously reported that IRS information systems were not designed to identify, address, and prevent such taxpayer abuse; (7) with respect to allegations of improper zeroing out or reductions of recommended taxes by IRS managers, GAO found no evidence to support the allegations in the eight specific cases referred to GAO by the IRS employees who testified at the hearings; (8) on the other hand, IRS did not systematically collect data on how much additional taxes recommended by auditors were zeroed out or reduced by IRS employees without a basis in law or IRS procedure; (9) IRS has acknowledged equal employment opportunity-related problems, including problems in hiring and promotion, in its Midwest District Office and has begun addressing them; and (10) IRS' lack of adequate information systems and documentation in the areas of employee discipline, retaliation against whistleblowers and taxpayers, and zeroing out of recommended taxes prevented GAO from doing a more comprehensive analysis of these issues.", "Government agencies have a long-standing obligation under the Privacy Act of 1974 to protect the privacy of individuals about whom they collect personal information. A number of additional laws have been enacted in recent years directing agency heads to designate senior officials as focal points with overall responsibility for privacy. GAO was asked to (1) describe laws and guidance that set requirements for senior privacy officials within federal agencies, and (2) describe the organizational structures used by agencies to address privacy requirements and assess whether senior officials have oversight over key functions. To achieve these objectives, GAO analyzed the laws and related guidance and analyzed policies and procedures relating to key privacy functions at 12 agencies. Federal laws set varying roles and responsibilities for senior agency privacy officials. Despite much variation, all of these laws require covered agencies to assign overall responsibility for privacy protection and compliance to a senior agency official. In addition, Office of Management and Budget guidance directs agencies to designate a senior agency official for privacy with specific responsibilities. The specific privacy responsibilities defined in these laws and guidance can be grouped into six broad categories: (1) conducting privacy impact assessments (which are intended to ensure that privacy requirements are addressed when personal information is collected, stored, shared, and managed in a federal system), (2) complying with the Privacy Act, (3) reviewing and evaluating the privacy implications of agency policies, (4) producing reports on the status of privacy protections, (5) ensuring that redress procedures to handle privacy inquiries and complaints are in place, and (6) ensuring that employees and contractors receive appropriate training. The laws and guidance vary in how they frame requirements in these categories and which agencies must adhere to them. Agencies also have varying organizational structures to address privacy responsibilities. For example, of the 12 agencies we reviewed, 2 had statutorily designated chief privacy officers who also served as senior agency officials for privacy, 5 designated their agency chief information officers as their senior privacy officials, and the others designated a variety of other officials, such as the general counsel or assistant secretary for management. Further, not all of the agencies we reviewed had given their designated senior officials full oversight over all privacy-related functions. While 6 agencies had these officials overseeing all key privacy functions, 6 others relied on other organizational units not overseen by the designated senior official to perform certain key privacy functions. The fragmented way in which privacy functions were assigned to organizational units in these agencies is at least partly the result of evolving requirements in law and guidance. However, without oversight of all key privacy functions, designated senior officials may be unable to effectively serve as agency central focal points for information privacy.", "This testimony discusses issues related to possible changes to the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) program, a topic that we have reported on in the past. At the end of chargeback year 2010, the FECA program, administered by the Department of Labor (Labor) paid more than $1.88 billion in wage-loss compensation, impairment, and death benefits, and another $898.1 million for medical and rehabilitation services and supplies. Currently, FECA benefits are paid to federal employees who are unable to work because of injuries sustained while performing their federal duties, including those who are at or older than retirement age. Concerns have been raised that federal employees on FECA receive benefits that could be more generous than under the traditional federal retirement system and that the program may have unintended incentives for beneficiaries to remain on the FECA program beyond the traditional retirement age. Over the past 30 years, there have been various proposals to change the FECA program to address this concern. Recent policy proposals to change the way FECA is administered for older beneficiaries share characteristics with past proposals we have discussed in prior work. In August 1996, we reported on the issues associated with changing benefits for older beneficiaries. Because FECA's benefit structure has not been significantly amended in more than 35 years, the policy questions raised in our 1996 report are still relevant and important today. This statement will focus on (1) previous proposals for changing FECA benefits for older beneficiaries and (2) questions and associated issues that merit consideration in crafting legislation to change benefits for older beneficiaries. This statement is drawn primarily from our 1996 report in which we solicited views from selected federal agencies and employee groups to identify questions and associated issues with crafting benefit changes. In that report, we also reviewed relevant laws and analyzed previous studies and legislative proposals that would have changed benefits for older FECA beneficiaries.. In summary, we have reported that the perception that many retirement-age beneficiaries were receiving more generous benefits on FECA had generated two alternative proposals to change benefits once beneficiaries reach the age at which retirement typically occurs: (1) converting FECA benefits to retirement benefits and, (2) changing FECA wage-loss benefits by establishing a new FECA annuity. We also discussed a number of issues to be considered in crafting legislation to change benefits for older beneficiaries. Going forward, Congress may wish to consider the following questions in assessing current proposals for change: (1) How would benefits be computed? (2) Which beneficiaries would be affected? (3) What criteria, such as age or retirement eligibility, would initiate changed benefits? (4) How would other benefits, such as FECA medical and survivor benefits, be treated and administered? (5) How would benefits, particularly retirement benefits, be funded?", "In 2005, GAO added the Department of Defense's (DOD) approach to business transformation to its high-risk list because (1) DOD's improvement efforts were fragmented, (2) DOD lacked an integrated and enterprisewide business transformation plan, and (3) DOD had not designated a senior official at the right level with the right authority to be responsible for overall business transformation efforts. This report assesses (1) the progress DOD has made in setting up a management framework for overall business transformation efforts and (2) the challenges DOD faces in maintaining and ensuring the success of those efforts. GAO conducted this work under the Comptroller General's authority to conduct evaluations under his own initiative. In conducting its work, GAO compared DOD's actions to key practices of successful transformations. Although DOD has made progress toward establishing a management framework for overall business transformation, the framework currently focuses on business systems modernization and does not fully address broader business transformation efforts. In 2005, DOD set up the Defense Business Systems Management Committee to review and approve the business enterprise architecture--a transformation blueprint--and new business systems modernization investments. It also established the Business Transformation Agency, which currently reports to the Vice Chair of the Defense Business Systems Management Committee, to coordinate and lead business transformation across the department. Despite these steps, DOD has not clearly defined or institutionalized interrelationships, roles and responsibilities, or accountability for establishing a management framework for overall business transformation. For example, differences of opinion exist within DOD about the roles of various senior leadership committees. Until DOD's business transformation management framework is institutionalized and encompasses broad responsibilities for all aspects of business transformation, it will be challenging for DOD to integrate related initiatives into a sustainable, enterprisewide approach to successfully resolve weaknesses in business operations that GAO has shown are at high risk of waste, fraud, and abuse. DOD also must overcome two critical challenges, among several others, if it is to maintain and ensure success. Specifically, DOD does not have (1) a comprehensive, integrated, and enterprisewide plan or set of linked plans, supported by a planning process that sets a strategic direction for overall business transformation efforts, prioritizes initiatives and resources, and monitors progress, and (2) a full-time leadership position at the right level dedicated solely to the planning, integration, and execution of overall business transformation efforts. A broad-based consensus exists among GAO and others, including the Institute for Defense Analyses and the Defense Business Board, that the status quo is unacceptable and that DOD needs a CMO to provide leadership over business transformation efforts. In a May 2007 letter to Congress, however, DOD stated its view that a separate position is not needed as the Deputy Secretary of Defense can fulfill the chief management officer (CMO) role. Although the Deputy Secretary may be at the right level with appropriate authority to transform business operations, the demands placed on this position make it difficult for the Deputy Secretary to focus solely on business transformation--nor does the position have the necessary term of appointment to sustain progress across administrations. Further, DOD plans to leave the assignment of the CMO role to the discretion of the Secretary of Defense. In GAO's view, codifying the CMO position in statute as a separate, full-time position at the right level with an extended term is necessary to provide sustained leadership, further DOD's progress, and address challenges the department continues to face in its business transformation efforts.", "To help address DOD's escalating health care costs, in 2013 DOD established the DHA to, among other things, combine common medical services such as medical education and training. DOD trains its servicemembers for a wide variety of medical positions, such as physicians, nurses, therapists, and pharmacists. DHA's Education and Training Directorate is to oversee many aspects of DOD's medical education and training and is now expected to begin operations in August 2014. GAO was mandated to review DOD's efforts to consolidate medical education and training. GAO examined the extent to which DOD has (1) conducted analysis to reform medical education and training to achieve cost savings and (2) determined whether the consolidation of training at METC has resulted in cost savings and designed processes to assess its effectiveness. GAO compared DHA implementation plans and METC budget information from fiscal years 2010 through 2012 with best practices and interviewed officials from the DHA, METC, and military services' Surgeons General offices. In its 2013 plans for the implementation of the Defense Health Agency (DHA), the Department of Defense (DOD) outlined the responsibilities of a new Education and Training Directorate, but has not demonstrated how its proposed reforms will result in cost savings. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 required DOD to develop business case analyses for its shared service proposals as part of its submissions on its plans for the implementation of DHA, including, among other things, the purpose of the shared service and the anticipated cost savings. Although DOD has stated that the Directorate is a shared service that combines common services and that it will result in cost savings, DOD has not fully developed the required business case analysis for the medical education and training reforms. This is because DOD has not yet completed the first step of the process, which includes identifying the specific problems that the reform is intended to address and thereby achieve cost savings. Unlike the medical education and training reforms, other DOD shared service projects present a clear linkage between (1) a stated problem, (2) proposed process changes, and (3) an estimate of benefits, costs, and risks. For the Directorate, DOD has identified the new processes it will employ, but has not identified the concerns the proposed new processes are intended to address and how they will achieve cost savings. In addition, some officials are unconvinced that the potential cost savings will be achieved, and stated that the creation of the Directorate serves more as a functional realignment than a cost savings endeavor. Without a fully developed business case analysis, it is unclear how DOD will measure any accomplishments and hold the Directorate accountable for achieving cost savings. DOD is unable to determine whether the consolidation of training at the Medical Education and Training Campus (METC) resulted in cost savings; however, DOD is taking action to improve some of the processes for evaluating the effectiveness of training at METC. DOD co-located medical training for enlisted medical servicemembers at METC as part of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) process to achieve cost savings, and subsequently, the services decided to consolidate their training. However, some officials stated they were unsure whether all funds were transferred to METC. Furthermore, due to a shortage of military service funds, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs provided funding for METC in addition to the services' transfers. DOD is unable to determine whether the consolidation of training at METC resulted in cost savings because it did not develop baseline cost information as part of its metrics to assess METC's success. Baseline cost information is a key characteristic of performance metrics critical to ensuring that processes achieve the desired results. Without baseline cost information prior to future course consolidation of training at METC and within the Education and Training Directorate, DOD will be unable to assess potential cost savings. DOD has designed processes to evaluate the quality of training at METC\u2014including processes related to certification rates, accreditation, and surveys. Further, DOD has taken action to improve some processes. For example, to improve the level of feedback received from METC surveys, METC officials have begun a pilot process to conduct their own post-graduation surveys. GAO recommends that DOD conduct a fully developed business case analysis for the Education and Training Directorate and develop baseline cost information as part of its metrics to assess cost savings for future consolidation efforts. In comments to a draft of this report, DOD concurred with each of GAO's recommendations.", "Concerned that federal agencies may not be getting the best prices available, Congress directed the General Services Administration (GSA) to study office supply purchases by the 10 largest federal agencies. GSA delivered the results of its study in November 2010. The study also discussed GSA\u0092s efforts to implement an initiative focused on leveraging the government\u0092s buying power to realize savings when buying office supplies, known as Office Supplies II (OS II). Under this initiative, GSA entered into agreements with vendors based on discounted prices to be offered to all federal agencies. Congress directed GAO to assess the GSA study, with particular attention to the potential for savings. Accordingly, GAO assessed (1) the support for the findings and conclusions in GSA\u0092s report and (2) how GSA's new office supply contracts support the goal of leveraging the government\u0092s buying power to achieve savings. To conduct this work, GAO analyzed the data GSA used for its study; met with and obtained documentation from officials at GSA and the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS), Air Force, Navy, and Army, which were among the 10 agencies in GSA\u0092s study; and reviewed contract documentation associated with GSA\u0092s new office supplies initiative. GSA and DHS commented on a draft of this report. GSA said it appreciated our recognition that leveraged purchasing can produce savings and also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. DHS provided additional information on its strategic sourcing initiatives. GSA estimated that federal agencies spent about $1.6 billion during fiscal year 2009 purchasing office supplies from more than 239,000 vendors. GSA concluded that agency buyers paid higher prices when they bought office supplies outside GSA\u0092s Multiple Award Schedule program than they would have using the schedules or OS II. According to GSA, the price premiums averaged 75 percent compared to the schedule prices and 86 percent compared to OS II. GAO identified data and other limitations in GSA\u0092s study, such as not always controlling for variation in quantities of identical items when comparing prices. GAO was not able to fully quantify the impact of these limitations. Officials from other agencies\u0097Air Force, Army, Navy, and DHS\u0097also questioned the study\u0092s specific findings on price premiums, believing them to be overstated, but their own studies support GSA\u0092s general conclusion that better prices can be obtained through consolidated, leveraged purchasing. The GSA study also concluded that buyers compared prices before making purchases, but this conclusion was based on interviews with senior-level acquisition officials and not on information obtained from any of the approximately 270,000 government purchase cardholders who made the purchasing decisions. According to available data, GSA\u0092s new office supplies sourcing initiative, OS II, has produced savings. GSA estimated that the government saved $16 million from June 2010 through August 2011 through this initiative. According to GSA, the OS II initiative is demonstrating that leveraged buying can produce savings and has provided improvements for managing ongoing and future strategic sourcing initiatives. GSA reports that OS II allowed it to negotiate discounts with vendors who were selected for the initiative, and has spurred price competition among schedule vendors that were not selected as they react to the OS II pricing, resulting in decreased schedule prices. The initiative is also expected to lower government-wide office supply costs through more centralized contract management. Another key aspect of the initiative is that participating vendors provide sales and other information to GSA to help monitor prices, savings, and vendor performance. Finally, the OS II initiative offers lessons learned for other strategic sourcing initiatives, including the importance of identifying agencies\u0092 goals and needs and ensuring buying agency participation.", "For entities that rely on others for funding, effective governance, accountability, and internal control are keys to maintaining trust and credibility. In recent years, corporate governance and accountability have received increased scrutiny and emphasis in the nonprofit, federal government, and public company sectors. Governance and accountability problems have also been identified at designated federal entities (DFE) such as the Smithsonian Institution, the Legal Services Corporation, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. This report responds to a congressional request that GAO describe (1) the statutory structure of the governing bodies for each DFE organization and (2) the role of the inspectors general (IGs) in the governance structure. To accomplish this, GAO surveyed the DFE heads and IGs on governance issues and reviewed information from a variety of sources, including the IG Act and subsequent amendments; enabling legislation for the DFEs; and legislative and regulatory standards and requirements for financial reporting and internal control. GAO is not making specific recommendations in this report, but is providing this information for consideration in future efforts to update the governance of DFEs, oversee the entities and their IGs, and continue work to improve the effectiveness of government. GAO received technical comments, which were incorporated as appropriate. The DFEs vary in structure and requirements for governance. At the time of GAO's review, the designated size of the governing bodies of the 31 DFEs ranged from 1 to 24 members. Fifteen had at least one vacancy and 2 had more vacancies than sitting members. The frequency of DFE multimember governing-body meetings ranged from daily to rarely or not at all. In GAO's survey of DFEs, 13 indicated that they are required to comply with 12 key statutes that cover management and accountability. The remaining 18 reported varying requirements, with one not subject to any of the statutes. Only 7 DFE governing bodies have a structure that includes governance or oversight committees for ensuring oversight of management decisions, results of operations, and emerging risks. While 19 DFEs reported having orientation programs for new governing body members, only 9 reported ongoing training. IG effectiveness is influenced by an entity's governance structure and practices. Within DFEs, IGs vary in their role and relationship with management. IGs are charged with preventing and detecting fraud and abuse; conducting audits and investigations; and recommending policies to promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness. To accomplish these objectives, IGs must be able to establish and maintain independence; have control of their resources to plan and perform work; recruit, retain, and manage sufficient professional staff; and be able to resolve audit and investigation recommendations. GAO's survey of IGs showed that most report to the highest levels in their entities, a legislative requirement that is a key element of independence. At the same time, the IGs had limited control over their resources, and their budgets and staffing were not always adequate to perform needed audits and investigations. Only 3 IGs had the transparency that a separate line item in their entity's budget provides, and 8 needed management approval for spending. Audit resolution varied, with some IGs reporting a lack of entity responsiveness to recommendations. Only 10 DFEs reported that their governing bodies have written policies for monitoring the implementation of IG recommendations. Nine of the 10 have policies that require the governing body to respond in writing and to develop a plan to address recommendations. During the course of GAO's work, Congress passed and the President signed into law on October 14, 2008, the Inspector General Reform Act of 2008, which was intended to enhance IG independence. Its implementation may mitigate some of the issues GAO found.", "In February 2007, a series of Washington Post articles about conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center highlighted problems in the Army's case management of injured servicemembers and in the military's disability evaluation system. These deficiencies included a confusing disability evaluation process and servicemembers in outpatient status for months and sometimes years without a clear understanding about their plan of care. These reported problems prompted various reviews and commissions to examine the care and services to servicemembers. In response to problems at Walter Reed and subsequent recommendations, the Army took a number of actions and DOD formed a joint DOD-VA Senior Oversight Committee. This statement updates GAO's September 2007 testimony and is based on ongoing work to (1) assess actions taken by the Army to help ill and injured soldiers obtain health care and navigate its disability evaluation process; and to (2) describe the status, plans, and challenges of DOD and VA efforts to implement a joint disability evaluation system. GAO's observations are based largely on documents obtained from and interviews with Army, DOD, and VA officials. The facts contained in this statement were discussed with representatives from the Army, DOD, and VA. Over the past year, the Army significantly increased support for servicemembers undergoing medical treatment and disability evaluations, but challenges remain. To provide a more integrated continuum of care for servicemembers, the Army created a new organizational structure--the Warrior Transition Unit--in which servicemembers are assigned key staff to help manage their recovery. Although the Army has made significant progress in staffing these units, several challenges remain, including hiring medical staff in a competitive market, replacing temporarily borrowed personnel with permanent staff, and getting eligible servicemembers into the units. To help servicemembers navigate the disability evaluation process, the Army is increasing staff in several areas, but gaps and challenges remain. For example, the Army expanded hiring of board liaisons to meet its goal of 30 servicemembers per liaison, but as of February 2008, the Army did not meet this goal at 11 locations that support about half of servicemembers in the process. The Army faces challenges hiring enough liaisons to meet its goals and enough legal personnel to help servicemembers earlier in the process. To address more systemic issues, DOD and VA promptly designed and are now piloting a streamlined disability evaluation process. In August 2007, DOD and VA conducted an intensive 5-day exercise that simulated alternative pilot approaches using previously-decided cases. This exercise yielded data quickly, but there were trade-offs in the nature and extent of data that could be obtained in that time frame. The pilot began with \"live\" cases at three treatment facilities in the Washington, D.C. area in November 2007, and DOD and VA may consider expanding the pilot to additional sites around July 2008. However, DOD and VA have not finalized their criteria for expanding the pilot beyond the original sites and may have limited pilot results at that time. Significantly, current evaluation plans lack key elements, such as an approach for measuring the performance of the pilot--in terms of timeliness and accuracy of decisions--against the current process, which would help planners manage for success of further expansion.", "GAO discussed the: (1) adequacy of the administrative expense reimbursement paid by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) to participating insurance companies for selling and servicing crop insurance; and (2) comparative cost to the government of delivering catastrophic crop insurance through USDA and the private sector. GAO noted that: (1) for the 1994 and 1995 period it reviewed, GAO found that the administrative expense reimbursement rate of 31 percent of premiums paid to insurance companies resulted in reimbursements that were $81 million more than the companies' expenses for selling and servicing crop insurance; (2) furthermore, GAO found that some of these reported expenses did not appear to be reasonably associated with the sale and service of federal crop insurance and accordingly should not be considered in determining an appropriate future reimbursement rate for administrative expenses; (3) among these expenses were those associated with acquiring competitors' businesses, profit sharing bonuses, and lobbying; (4) in addition, GAO found other expenses that appeared excessive for reimbursement through a taxpayer-supported program; (5) these expenses suggest an opportunity to further reduce future reimbursement rates; (6) these expenses included agents' commissions that exceeded the industry average, unnecessary travel-related expenses, and questionable entertainment activities; (7) finally, a variety of factors that have emerged since the period covered by GAO's review have increased companies' revenues or may decrease companies' expenses; (8) crop prices and premium rates increased in 1996 and 1997, generating higher premiums; (9) this had the effect of increasing FCIC's expense reimbursement to companies; (10) at the same time, companies' expenses associated with crop insurance sales and service could decrease as FCIC reduces the administrative requirements with which the companies must comply; (11) combined, all these factors indicate that FCIC could lower the reimbursement to a rate in the range of 24 percent of premiums and still amply cover reasonable company expenses for selling and servicing federal crop insurance policies; (12) regarding the cost of catastrophic insurance delivery, GAO found that, in 1995, the government's total costs to deliver catastrophic insurance were less through USDA than private companies; (13) although the basic costs associated with selling and servicing catastrophic crop insurance through USDA and private companies were comparable, total delivery costs were less through USDA because USDA's delivery avoids the need to pay an underwriting gain to companies; (14) finally, GAO identified a number of different approaches to reimbursing companies for their administrative expenses that offer the opportunity for cost savings; and (15) companies generally prefer the existing reimbursement method because of its relative administrative simplicity.", "The Joint Exercise Program is the principal means for combatant commanders to maintain trained and ready forces, exercise contingency and theater security cooperation plans, and conduct joint and multinational training exercises. These exercises are primarily aimed at developing the skills needed by U.S. forces to operate in a joint environment and can also help build partner-nation capacity and strengthen alliances. House Report 114-102 included a provision for GAO to review DOD's Joint Exercise Program. This report (1) describes guidance DOD has developed for its Joint Exercise Program and DOD's approach to assess the effectiveness of the program and (2) evaluates the extent to which DOD uses two information technology systems to manage the program. GAO observed data in JTIMS and analyzed fiscal years 2014-16 financial data and supporting documentation in the Execution Management System. The Department of Defense (DOD) has developed a body of guidance for the Joint Exercise Program and has implemented an approach to assess the effectiveness of the program. In addition to the body of guidance for the program, DOD is working to update a key guidance document for military training in accordance with a congressional requirement. DOD's approach to assess the effectiveness of the Joint Exercise Program is aimed at ensuring that its performance measures are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-phased (commonly referred to as the SMART rubric). The Joint Assessment and Enabling Capability office reviews the performance measures created by the combatant commands against this rubric and provides input and coaching on improving the measures through an ongoing and collaborative process. DOD uses two key information technology systems\u2014the Joint Training Information Management System (JTIMS) and the Execution Management System\u2014to manage the execution of the Joint Exercise Program, but does not have assurance that funding execution data in the Execution Management System are reliable. JTIMS is the system of record for the Joint Exercise Program that combatant commanders use to plan and manage their joint training exercises. GAO observed significant variation in the type and quality of information entered in JTIMS. Combatant command and Joint Staff officials stated that information in JTIMS lacked consistency in the level of detail provided, sometimes making it difficult to coordinate training with other combatant commands or extract pertinent information about exercises from the system that would be helpful in planning other exercises. Consequently, to help improve the consistency and standardization of information across combatant commands, the Joint Staff published a user guide for JTIMS. Regarding the Execution Management System, a web-based database DOD uses to track the most recent funding execution data for the Joint Exercise Program, GAO found that DOD does not have assurance that the system produces quality information because supporting documentation is not consistently uploaded into the system and, when it is uploaded, it is not reconcilable to the data entered there. Only U.S. Strategic Command and U.S. Northern Command uploaded supporting documentation for fiscal years 2013-16 as required by the Execution Management System guidance. Reviewing a nongeneralizable sample of uploaded supporting documentation for fiscal years 2014-16, GAO found that the sum of the individual expenditures reported in supporting documentation did not match corresponding total expenditures entered in the system for any of the four combatant commands included in GAO's review. Further, the four combatant commands GAO visited, the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness had not implemented effective internal controls similar to those identified in the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government to ensure the completeness and accuracy of financial information captured for the Joint Exercise Program. Without such internal controls, DOD and other key decision makers may not have the financial information of sufficient quality to defend the Joint Exercise Program's budget. GAO recommends that DOD comply with current guidance to upload supporting documentation in the Execution Management System and implement effective internal controls to ensure the completeness and accuracy of financial information. DOD partially concurred with both recommendations, noting existing controls in other related systems of record. GAO believes the recommendations remain valid, as discussed in this report.", "From 1990 through 2001, the Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank) of the United States provided export financing commitments totaling $31 billion to promote the export of U.S. goods and services for use in the energy sector. The energy sector is divided into fossil fuel, renewable, and nuclear energy. Financing is provided through a range of products, including loans and guarantees, export credit insurance, and working capital guarantees. Of the $28 billion Ex-Im Bank provided in loans and guarantees for energy-related projects from 1990 to 2001, 93 percent was used to finance fossil fuel projects, and 3 percent was for renewable energy projects. Trends in applications for fossil fuel and renewable energy projects largely mirrored trends in the energy projects financed because 90 percent of applications submitted were financed. Since 1990, Ex-Im Bank has not consistently provided information about its renewable energy program to Congress; its 1995 and 1998 annual reports did not address renewable energy. Ex-Im Bank's energy portfolio is affected by broad factors such as worldwide market conditions and to some degree by its policies, promotion efforts, and programs. The relatively small share of renewable energy in worldwide energy consumption, due in part to cost factors, is a key factor. Although Ex-Im Bank has undertaken some efforts to promote renewable energy, it has not focused specifically on this sector.", "The federal government has invested billions of dollars to improve student academic performance, and many schools, teachers, and researchers are trying to determine the most effective instructional practices with which to accomplish this. The Conference Report for the Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2008 directed GAO to study strategies used to prepare students to meet state academic achievement standards. To do this, GAO answered: (1) What types of instructional practices are schools and teachers most frequently using to help students achieve state academic standards, and do those instructional practices differ by school characteristics? (2) What is known about how standards-based accountability systems have affected instructional practices? (3) What is known about instructional practices that are effective in improving student achievement? GAO analyzed data from a 2006-2007 national survey of principals and 2005-2006 survey of teachers in three states, conducted a literature review of the impact of standards-based accountability systems on instructional practices and of practices that are effective in improving student achievement, and interviewed experts. Nationwide, most principals focused on multiple strategies to help students meet academic standards, such as using student data to inform instruction and increasing professional development for teachers, according to our analysis of data from a U.S. Department of Education survey. Many of these strategies were used more often at high-poverty schools--those where 75 percent or more of the students were eligible for the free and reduced-price lunch program--and high-minority schools--those where 75 percent or more of students were identified as part of a minority population, than at lower poverty and minority schools. Likewise, math teachers in California, Georgia, and Pennsylvania increased their use of certain instructional practices in response to their state tests, such as focusing more on topics emphasized on assessments and searching for more effective teaching methods, and teachers at high-poverty and high-minority schools were more likely than teachers at lower-poverty schools and lower-minority schools to have made these changes, according to GAO's analysis of survey data collected by the RAND Corporation. Some researchers suggested that differences exist in the use of these practices because schools with lower poverty or lower minority student populations might generally be meeting accountability requirements and therefore would need to try these strategies less frequently. Research shows that standards-based accountability systems can influence instructional practices in both positive and negative ways. For example, some research notes that using a standards-based curriculum that is aligned with corresponding instructional guidelines can facilitate the development of higher order thinking skills in students. But, in some cases, teacher practices did not always reflect the principles of standards-based instruction, and the difficulties in aligning practice with standards were attributed, in part, to current accountability requirements. Other research noted that assessments can be powerful tools for improving the learning process and evaluating student achievement, but assessments can also have some unintended negative consequences on instruction, including narrowing the curriculum to only material that is tested. Many experts stated that methodological issues constrain knowing more definitively the specific instructional practices that improve student learning and achievement. Nevertheless, some studies and experts pointed to instructional practices that are considered to be effective in raising student achievement, such as differentiated instruction. Professional development for teachers was also highlighted as important for giving teachers the skills and knowledge necessary to implement effective teaching practices.", "This testimony discusses issues related to the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). In hearings conducted from 1990 through 1994, Congress noted that violence against women was a problem of national scope and that the majority of crimes associated with domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking were perpetrated against women. These hearings culminated in the enactment of VAWA in 1994 to address these issues on a national level. VAWA established grant programs within the Departments of Justice (DOJ) and Health and Human Services (HHS) for state, local, and Indian tribal governments and communities. These grants have various purposes, such as providing funding for direct services including emergency shelter, counseling, and legal services for victims of domestic violence, sexual assaults and stalking across all segments of the population. Recipients of funds from these grant programs include, among others, state agencies, tribes, shelters, rape crisis centers, organizations that provide legal services, and hotlines. In 2000, during the reauthorization of VAWA, language was added to the law to provide greater emphasis on dating violence. The 2006 reauthorization of VAWA expanded existing grant programs and added new programs addressing, among other things, young victims. In fiscal year 2011, Congress appropriated approximately $418 million for violence against women programs administered by DOJ and made an additional $133 million available for programs administered by HHS. The 2006 reauthorization of VAWA required us to study and report on data indicating the prevalence of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking among men, women, youth, and children, as well as services available to the victims. Such data could be used to inform decisions regarding investments in grant programs. In response, we issued two reports in November 2006 and July 2007 on these issues, respectively. This testimony is based on these reports and selected updates we conducted in July 2011 related to actions DOJ and HHS have taken since our prior reviews to improve the quality of recipient data. This testimony, as requested, highlights findings from those reports and discusses the extent to which (1) national data collection efforts report on the prevalence of men, women, youth, and children who are victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking, and (2) the federal government has collected data to track the types of services provided to these categories of victims and any challenges federal departments report that they and their grant recipients face in collecting and reporting demographic characteristics of victims receiving such services by type of service. In November 2006, we reported that since 2001, the amount of national research that has been conducted on the prevalence of domestic violence and sexual assault had been limited, and less research had been conducted on dating violence and stalking. At that time, no single, comprehensive effort existed that provided nationwide statistics on the prevalence of these four categories of crime among men, women, youth, and children. Rather, various national efforts addressed certain subsets of these crime categories among some segments of the population and were not intended to provide comprehensive estimates. For example, HHS's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Violent Death Reporting System, which collects incident-based data from multiple sources, such as coroner/medical examiner reports, gathered information on violent deaths resulting from domestic violence and sexual assaults, among other crimes. However, it did not gather information on deaths resulting from dating violence or stalking incidents. We reported in July 2007 that recipients of 11 grant programs we reviewed collected and reported data to the respective agencies on the types of services they provide, such as counseling; the total number of victims served; and in some cases, demographic information, such as the age of victims; however, data were not available on the extent to which men, women, youth, and children receive each type of service for all services. This situation occurred primarily because the statutes governing the 11 grant programs do not require the collection of demographic data by type of service, although they do require reports on program effectiveness, including number of persons served and number of persons seeking services who could not be served. Nevertheless, VAWA authorizes that a range of services can be provided to victims, and we determined that services were generally provided to men, women, youth, and children. The agencies administering these 11 grant programs--HHS and DOJ--collect some demographic data for certain services, such as emergency shelter under the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act and supervised visitation and exchange under VAWA. The quantity of information collected and reported varied greatly for the 11 programs and was extensive for some, such as those administered by DOJ's Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) under VAWA. The federal agencies use this information to help inform Congress about the known results and effectiveness of the grant programs. However, even if demographic data were available by type of service for all services, such data might not be uniform and reliable because, among other factors, (1) the authorizing statutes for these programs have different purposes and (2) recipients of grants administered by HHS and DOJ use varying data collection practices.", "GAO discussed certain aspects of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) management and oversight of its loan insurance program for home improvements under Title I of the National Housing Act, focusing on: (1) the extent to which the information needed to manage the program was available to HUD; (2) the extent to which HUD was overseeing program lenders; and (3) whether HUD has any ongoing or planned efforts under way to strengthen its management and oversight. GAO noted that: (1) its preliminary analysis shows that HUD is not collecting information needed for managing the program; (2) specifically, GAO found that HUD collects little information when loans are made on program borrowers, properties, and loan terms, such as the borrower's income and the address of the property being improved; (3) moreover, HUD does not maintain information on why it denies loan claims or why it subsequently approves some for payment; (4) HUD also provides limited oversight of lenders' compliance with program regulations, conducting only 2 on-site lender reviews in fiscal year 1997 of the approximately 3,700 program lenders; (5) regarding the need for oversight of lenders' compliance, GAO found that loan claim files submitted by lenders to HUD following loan defaults often do not contain required loan documents, including the original loan applications and certifications signed by the borrower that the property improvement work has been completed; (6) in addition, some claims were paid by HUD even though there were indications that lenders did not comply with required underwriting standards when insuring the loan; (7) as a result of the management and oversight weaknesses GAO has observed, its preliminary work indicates that HUD does not know who the program is serving, if lenders are complying with program regulations, and whether certain potential program abuses are occurring, such as violations of the $25,000 limitation on the amount of Title I loan indebtedness for each property; (8) HUD officials attributed these weaknesses to the program's being lender-operated, limited staff resources, and HUD's assignment of monitoring priorities; (9) under the HUD 2020 Management Reform Plan and related efforts, HUD is making significant changes in all of its single-family housing programs, including the Title I property improvement program; (10) these changes are motivated in part by HUD's goals to downsize the agency and address long-standing agencywide management weaknesses; and (11) GAO is assessing the extent to which these changes may affect the management and oversight weaknesses it identified.", "The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) relies extensively on information technology (IT) to carry out its logistics support mission. This report focuses on DLA's processes for making informed IT investment decisions. Because IT investment management has only recently become an area of management focus and commitment at DLA, the agency's ability to effectively manage IT investments is limited. The first step toward establishing effective investment management is putting in place foundational, project-level control and selection processes. The second step toward effective investment management is to continually assess proposed and ongoing projects as an integrated and competing set of investment options. Accomplishing these two steps requires effective development and implementation of a plan, supported by senior management, which defines and prioritizes investment process improvements. Without a well-defined process improvement plan and controls for implementing it, it is unlikely that the agency will establish a mature investment management capability. As a result, GAO continues to question DLA's ability to make informed and prudent investment decisions in IT.", "Due to concerns about long standing delays in the security clearance process, Congress mandated reforms in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA), which requires, among other things, that the executive branch report annually to Congress. Since 2005, the Department of Defense's (DOD) clearance program has been on GAO's high-risk list due to delays and incomplete documentation. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) conducts much of the government's clearance investigations. In 2007, the Director of National Intelligence and DOD established a Joint Reform Team to coordinate governmentwide improvement efforts for the process. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) oversees these efforts. Based on two recent GAO reports, this statement addresses (1) progress in reducing delays at DOD, (2) opportunities for improving executive branch reports to Congress and (3) the extent to which joint reform efforts reflect key factors for reform. GAO independently analyzed DOD clearances granted in fiscal year 2008, assessed the executive branch's 2006-2009 reports to Congress, and compared three joint reform reports to key transformation practices. GAO previously recommended that OMB improve the transparency in executive branch reporting and establish a strategic framework. OMB concurred or partially concurred with these recommendations. DOD and OPM have made significant progress in reducing delays in making security clearance decisions and met statutory timeliness requirements for DOD's initial clearances completed in fiscal year 2008. IRTPA currently requires that decisions on at least 80 percent of initial clearances be made within an average of 120 days. In 2008, GAO found that OPM and DOD made initial decisions on these clearances within 87 days, on average. Opportunities exist for the executive branch to improve its annual reports to Congress. For example, the executive branch's 2009 report to Congress did not reflect the full range of time it took to make all initial clearance decisions and has provided little information on quality. Under the current IRTPA requirements, the executive branch can exclude the slowest 20 percent of clearances and then calculate timeliness based on an average of the remaining clearances. GAO analyzed 100 percent of initial clearances granted in 2008 without taking averages or excluding the slowest clearances and found that 39 percent took more than 120 days. The absence of comprehensive reporting limits full visibility over the timeliness of initial clearance decisions. With respect to quality, although IRTPA grants the executive branch latitude in reporting, the 2006-2009 reports provided little information on quality. However, the 2009 report identified quality measures that the executive branch proposes to collect. GAO has stated that timeliness alone does not provide a complete picture of the clearance process. For example, GAO recently estimated that with respect to initial top secret clearances adjudicated in July 2008, documentation was incomplete for most OPM investigative reports. Greater attention to quality could increase instances of reciprocity--an entity's acceptance of another entity's clearances. Initial joint reform efforts reflect key practices for organizational transformation that GAO has identified, such as having committed leadership and a dedicated implementation team, but the Joint Reform Team's reports do not provide a strategic framework that contains important elements of successful transformation, including long-term goals with outcome-focused performance measures, nor do they identify potential obstacles to progress and possible remedies. Further, GAO's prior work and IRTPA identified several factors key to reforming the clearance process. These include (1) engaging in governmentwide reciprocity, (2) consolidating information technology, and (3) identifying and reporting long-term funding requirements. However, the Joint Reform Team's information technology strategy does not yet define roles and responsibilities for implementing a new automated capability which is intended to be a cross-agency collaborative initiative. Also, the joint reform reports do not contain information on funding requirements or identify funding sources. The reform effort's success will depend upon the extent to which the Joint Reform Team is able to fully address these key factors moving forward. Further, it is imperative that OMB's Deputy Director for Management continue in the crucial role as chair of the Performance Accountability Council, which oversees joint reform team efforts.", "The federal government has an annual, governmentwide procurement goal of at least five percent for small disadvantaged businesses (SDB). SDBs are eligible for various price and evaluation benefits when being considered for federal contract awards. SDB firms must have their SDB status certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA). Because of concerns over reports that fewer businesses were receiving SDB certification than expected, GAO examined the SBA certification processes to (1) determine the number of businesses that SBA had certified as socially and economically disadvantaged since the implementation of the Small Disadvantaged Business Certification program and (2) obtain views on reasons for the current difference in the number of SDB certifications from the number that had previously self-certified as SDBs. SBA records show that 9,034 small business firms were certified as SDBs as of August 24, 2000. According to SDB officials, 6,405 of these were automatically certified because of their 8(a) certification. The number of SDBs that have been certified by SBA is significantly lower than the 30,000 projected by SBA based on the number of firms that had self-certified as SDBs. Possible reasons for this discrepancy include (1) company reluctance to participate because of their uncertainty as to when or how the program would be implemented, (2) the perception by businesses that the application process is burdensome, and (3) the belief by some companies that the benefits do not justify the effort.", "Voting is fundamental to our democracy, and federal law generally requires polling places to be accessible to all eligible voters for federal elections, including voters with disabilities. However, during the 2000 federal election, GAO found that only 16 percent of polling places had no potential impediments to access for people with disabilities. To address these and other issues, Congress enacted the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA), which required each polling place to have an accessible voting system. We examined (1) the proportion of polling places during the 2008 federal election with features that might facilitate or impede access for voters with disabilities compared to our findings from 2000; (2) actions states are taking to facilitate voting access; and (3) steps the Department of Justice (Justice) has taken to enforce HAVA voting access provisions. GAO visited 730 randomly selected polling places across the country, representing polling places nationwide, on Election Day 2008. GAO also surveyed states and interviewed federal officials. Compared to 2000, the proportion of polling places without potential impediments increased and almost all polling places had an accessible voting system. In 2008, based upon our survey of polling places, we estimate that 27.3 percent of polling places had no potential impediments in the path from the parking to the voting area--up from16 percent in 2000; 45.3 percent had potential impediments but offered curbside voting; and the remaining 27.4 percent had potential impediments and did not offer curbside voting. All but one polling place we visited had an accessible voting system--typically, an electronic machine in a voting station--to facilitate private and independent voting for people with disabilities. However, 46 percent of polling places had an accessible voting system that could pose a challenge to certain voters with disabilities, such as voting stations that were not arranged to accommodate voters using wheelchairs. Most states have established accessibility requirements and funded improvements to help facilitate accessible voting, and all states reported that they required local jurisdictions to offer alternative voting methods. In 2008, 43 states reported that they required accessibility standards for polling places, up from 23 states in 2000. Additionally, most states reported that they used federal HAVA funds to improve the physical accessibility of polling places. Further, all states reported that they required local jurisdictions to offer alternative voting methods, such as absentee voting. At the same time, 31 states reported that ensuring polling place accessibility was challenging. Justice provided guidance on polling place accessibility and conducted an initial assessment of states' compliance with HAVA's January 2006 deadline for accessible voting systems. Since then, Justice's oversight of HAVA's access requirements is part of two other enforcement efforts, but gaps remain. While Justice provided guidance on polling place accessibility, this guidance does not address accessibility of the voting area itself. Justice currently conducts polling place observations for federal elections that identifies whether an accessible voting system is in place, but it does not systematically assess the physical accessibility of polling places or the level of privacy and independence provided to voters with disabilities. Justice also conducts a small number of annual community assessments of Americans with Disabilities Act compliance of public buildings, which includes buildings designated as polling places. However, these assessments do not provide a national perspective on polling place accessibility or assess any special features of the voting area and the accessible voting system that are set up only on Election Day.", "In 2008,GAO reported that about $1 billion in undisbursed funding remained in expired grant accounts in the largest civilian payment system for grants, PMS, operated by the Department of Health and Human Services\u0092 Program Support Center. GAO was asked to update its 2008 analysis evaluating: (1) the amount of undisbursed funding remaining in expired grant accounts, including the amounts that have remained unspent for at least 5 years or more and for 10 years or more; (2) issues raised by GAO and federal inspectors general related to timely grant closeout by federal agencies; and (3) actions OMB and agencies have taken to track undisbursed balances in grants eligible for closeout. To do this, GAO analyzed data from two federal payment systems disbursing 79 percent of all civilian federal grant awards\u0097PMS and the ASAP system, which is operated jointly by the Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. In addition, GAO also reviewed audit reports that it and federal inspectors general issued; relevant OMB circulars and guidance; and performance reports from federal agencies. At the end of fiscal year 2011, GAO identified more than $794 million in funding remaining in expired grant accounts\u0097accounts that were more than 3 months past the grant end date and had no activity for 9 months or more\u0097in the Payment Management System (PMS). GAO found that undisbursed balances remained in some grant accounts several years past their expiration date: $110.9 million in undisbursed funding remained unspent more than 5 years past the grant end date, including $9.5 million that remained unspent for 10 years or more. GAO also found $126 million in grant accounts in the Automated Standard Application for Payments (ASAP) for which there had been no activity for 2 years or more, including $11 million that remained inactive for 5 years or more. However, data from these two systems are not comparable because, unlike PMS, ASAP accounts can include multiple grant agreements between a federal agency and a grantee, only some of which may be eligible for closeout. GAO and agency inspectors general have raised concerns in audit reports about timely grant closeout. These reports found that some agencies lack adequate systems or policies to properly monitor grant closeout or did not deobligate funds from grants eligible for close out in a timely manner. OMB issued guidance to certain agencies at the direction of Congress for reporting undisbursed balances in expired grant accounts that instructed agencies to report on expired appropriations accounts rather than grant accounts eligible for closeout. By focusing on grants eligible for closeout, OMB could better direct agency management toward grants in need of more immediate attention. Grant closeout makes funds less susceptible to fraud, waste, and mismanagement; reduces the potential costs in fees related to maintaining grants; and may enable agencies to redirect resources to other projects. GAO recommends that OMB revise future guidance to better target undisbursed balances in grants eligible for closeout and instruct agencies to take action to close out grants that are several years past their end date or have no undisbursed balances remaining. OMB staff said that they generally agreed with the recommendGAO recommends that OMB revise future guidance to better target undisbursed balances in grants eligible for closeout and instruct agencies to take action to close out grants that are several years past their end date or have no undisbursed balances remaining. OMB staff said that they generally agreed with the recommendations and will consider them as they review and streamline grant policy guidance.ations and will consider them as they review and streamline grant policy guidance.", "U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Risk Management Agency (RMA) administers the federal crop insurance program in partnership with insurance companies who share in the risk of loss or gain. In 2002, American Growers Insurance Company (American Growers), at the time, the largest participant in the program, was placed under regulatory control by the state of Nebraska. To ensure that policyholders were protected and that farmers' claims were paid, RMA agreed to fund the dissolution of American Growers. To date, RMA has spent about $40 million. GAO was asked to determine (1) what factors led to the failure of American Growers, (2) whether RMA procedures were adequate to monitor companies' financial condition, and (3) how effectively and efficiently RMA handled the dissolution of American Growers. The failure of American Growers was caused by the cumulative effect of company decisions that reduced the company's surplus, making it vulnerable to collapse when widespread drought in 2002 erased anticipated profits. The company's decisions were part of an overall strategy to increase the scope and size of American Growers' crop insurance business. However, when anticipated profits did not cover the company's high operating expenses and dropped its surplus below statutory minimums, Nebraska's Department of Insurance (NDOI) declared the company to be in a hazardous financial condition prompting the state commissioner to take control of the company. In 2002, RMA's oversight was inadequate to evaluate the overall financial condition of companies selling federal crop insurance. Although RMA reviewed companies' plans for selling crop insurance and analyzed selected financial data, oversight procedures generally focused on financial data 6 to 18 months old and were insufficient to assess the overall financial health of the company. Additionally, RMA did not routinely share information or otherwise coordinate with state regulators on the financial condition of companies participating in the crop insurance program. For example, NDOI had identified financial and management weaknesses at American Growers. Since American Growers' failure, RMA has acted to strengthen its oversight procedures by requiring additional information on companies' planned financial operations. It is also working to improve its coordination with state insurance regulators. However, as we completed our review, neither of these initiatives had been included in written agency policies. When American Growers failed, RMA effectively protected the company's policyholders, but lacked a policy to ensure it handled the insolvency efficiently. RMA has spent over $40 million, working with the state of Nebraska, to protect policyholders by ensuring that policies were transferred to other companies and that farmers' claims were paid. NDOI accommodated RMA's interests by allowing RMA to fund the operation of the company long enough to pay farmers' claims. Prior to American Growers' failure, RMA did not have an agreement with the NDOI commissioner defining state and federal financial roles and responsibilities. If the NDOI commissioner had decided to liquidate the company, RMA may have incurred more costs and had less flexibility in protecting policyholders.", "Congress passed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to address public concerns over the mismanagement and abuse of private sector employee benefit plans by some plan sponsors and administrators. The Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) shares responsibility with the Internal Revenue Service and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation for enforcing ERISA. EBSA works to safeguard the economic interest of more than 150 million people who participate in an estimated 6 million employee benefit plans with assets in excess of $4.4 trillion. EBSA plays a primary role in ensuring that employee benefit plans operate in the interests of plan participants, and the effective management of its enforcement program is pivotal to ensuring the economic security of workers and retirees. Recent scandals involving abuses by pension plan fiduciaries and service providers, as well as trading scandals in mutual funds that affected plan participants and other investors, highlight the importance of ensuring that EBSA has an effective and efficient enforcement program. Accordingly, this testimony focuses on describing EBSA's enforcement strategy, EBSA's efforts to address weaknesses in its enforcement program along with the challenges that remain. EBSA's enforcement strategy is a multifaceted approach of targeted plan investigations. To leverage its enforcement resources, EBSA provides education to plan participants and plan sponsors. EBSA allows its regional offices the flexibility to tailor their investigations to address the unique issues in the regions, within a framework established by EBSA's Office of Enforcement. The regional offices then have a significant degree of autonomy in developing and carrying out investigations using a mixture of approaches and techniques they deem most appropriate. Participant leads are still the major source of investigations. EBSA officials told us that they open about 4,000 investigations into actual and potential violations of ERISA annually. To supplement their investigations, the regions conduct outreach activities to educate both plan participants and sponsors. The purpose of these efforts is to gain participants' help in identifying potential violations and to educate sponsors in properly managing their plans and avoiding violations. Finally, EBSA maintains a Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program through which plan officials can voluntarily report and correct some violations without penalty. EBSA has taken steps to address many of the recommendations we have made over the years to improve its enforcement program, including assessing the level and types of noncompliance with ERISA, improving sharing of best investigative practices, and developing a human capital strategy to better respond changes in its workforce. EBSA reported a significant increase in enforcement results for fiscal year 2004, including $3.1 billion in total monetary results and closing about 4,400 investigations, with nearly 70 percent of those cases resulting in corrections of ERISA violations. Despite this progress, EBSA continues to face a number of significant challenges to its enforcement program, including (1) the lack of timely and reliable plan information, which is highlighted by the fact that EBSA is currently using plan year 2002 and 2003 plan information for its computer targeting, (2) restrictive statutory requirements that limit its ability to assess certain penalties, and (3) the need to better coordinate enforcement strategies with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is highlighted by recent scandals involving the trading practices and market timing in mutual funds and conflicts of interest by pension consultants.", "In 2000, the Congress passed the Open-market Reorganization for the Betterment of International Telecommunications Act (ORBIT Act) to help promote a more competitive global satellite services market. The ORBIT Act called for the full privatization of INTELSAT, a former intergovernmental organization that provided international satellite services. GAO agreed to provide federal officials' and stakeholders' views on (1) whether the privatization steps required by the ORBIT Act have been implemented and whether there were potential inconsistencies between ORBIT Act requirements and U.S. obligations made in international trade agreements; (2) whether access by global satellite companies to non-U.S. markets has improved since the enactment of the ORBIT Act and, if so, to what is this generally attributed; and (3) if any market access problems remain, what role does the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have in addressing those problems under the ORBIT Act. Most of INTELSAT's privatization steps have taken place and a variety of stakeholders told us that implementation of the ORBIT Act was not inconsistent with the commitments that the United States made in international trade agreements. In July 2001, INTELSAT transferred its satellite and financial assets to a private company. FCC determined that this and other actions satisfied the ORBIT Act requirements for INTELSAT's privatization but noted that the company must hold an initial public offering (IPO) of securities by a required date. The current deadline for the IPO is June 30, 2005. Because Intelsat has not completed the IPO, some satellite companies assert that privatization is not fully complete. Some parties have pointed out that there was a possibility that implementation of the ORBIT Act could have given rise to action arguably inconsistent with commitments that the United States made in international trade agreements. However, we were told that actual implementation avoided such outcomes and no disputes arose. Most stakeholders and experts that GAO spoke with believe that access to non-U.S. satellite markets has improved, but few attribute this improvement to the ORBIT Act. These stakeholders and experts said that global trade agreements, such as the WTO's basic telecommunications commitments, and the global trend towards privatization of telecommunications companies have improved access in non-U.S. markets. Several stakeholders and experts told GAO that improvements in market access were already underway when the Congress passed the ORBIT Act and that the act has complemented ongoing trends towards more open satellite markets. Some satellite companies report continuing market access problems, but there are disagreements regarding whether FCC should investigate and resolve these problems. Some satellite companies that GAO spoke with report problems with access to non-U.S. satellite markets, which they attribute to countries with policies that favor domestic and regional satellite companies, countries exercising control over content, bureaucratic processes in various countries, and long-term business relationships between INTELSAT and various telecommunications companies. Most companies GAO spoke with report that Intelsat does not take active steps to acquire preferential or exclusive market access, and Intelsat itself stated that it does not seek nor, if offered, would accept preferential market access. Finally, some companies suggest that FCC should take a more proactive role in investigating market access problems, rather than assuming an adjudicative role. FCC said that evidence provided to the agency has not been sufficient to warrant action and also suggested that trade disputes are more appropriately addressed by the United States Trade Representative.", "The military services store prepositioned stocks of equipment and material on ships and land in locations around the world to enable the rapid fielding of combat-ready forces. GAO's prior work has shown that the readiness and safety of military equipment can be severely degraded by corrosion and that the Department of Defense (DOD) spends billions of dollars annually to address corrosion. GAO was asked to review the impact of corrosion on prepositioned assets. GAO's specific objectives were to assess (1) the measures taken by the Army and the Marine Corps to reduce the impact of corrosion on prepositioned assets and (2) the availability of corrosion-related data to the Army and the Marine Corps to support corrosion prevention and mitigation efforts for prepositioned assets. The Army and Marine Corps have taken some measures to reduce the impact of corrosion on prepositioned assets, primarily through the use of humidity-controlled storage facilities on ships and in some land-based locations, but a substantial portion of Army land-based prepositioned assets are stored outdoors and are left relatively unprotected from elements that contribute to corrosion. When equipment was drawn for military operations for Operation Iraqi Freedom during 2003, it was reported in good operating condition and not degraded by corrosion. Most of this equipment had been stored in humidity-controlled facilities. However, whereas all Marine Corps prepositioned assets are stored in humidity-controlled facilities, the Army currently stores a significant amount of its land-based prepositioned assets outdoors. Under Army policy, the preferred method for storing prepositioned assets is in humidity-controlled facilities because outdoor storage makes equipment more susceptible to corrosion and increases maintenance requirements and costs. One Army study showed that sheltering equipment in a humidity-controlled facility had a return on investment, at minimum, of $8 for every $1 invested. In South Korea, the Army has recently completed an intensive effort to repair prepositioned assets and correct some long-standing problems, but almost one-third of the assets continue to be stored outside. Similarly, as the Army reconstitutes its prepositioned equipment in Southwest Asia, thousands of Army equipment items in Kuwait are stored outdoors in harsh environmental conditions. Army officials cited competing funding priorities and other factors as reasons for not providing indoor storage for all land-based prepositioned assets. However, temporary shelters may be a feasible option to address immediate storage needs. The Army has used temporary shelters and humidity-controlled storage for some prepositioned assets. Although the Army requires corrosion-related data collection for equipment items and Marine Corps officials believe them to be beneficial, data that could help reduce corrosion of prepositioned assets are not available. They are not available because the services consider this information to be a low priority and do not systematically collect it. Without these data, the services are not in a position to identify causes of corrosion, support efforts to more effectively reduce corrosion, and achieve long-term cost savings. Army and Marine Corps documents include information on the maintenance condition, actions, and costs for prepositioned equipment, but provide little data on corrosion. While cost data are limited, the services have estimated that about 25 percent of overall equipment maintenance costs are corrosion related and perhaps as much as one-third of these costs could be reduced through more effective corrosion prevention and mitigation. An Army review of maintenance records for about 2,000 pieces of prepositioned stock in South Korea found that $8.7 million (31 percent) of the estimated $28 million spent to restore this equipment was used to address corrosion. The Army has had previous success using corrosion data on non-prepositioned equipment programs to support corrosion prevention and mitigation.", "Traditionally, electricity has moved in one direction\u2014from electricity suppliers to customers. Today, solar systems allow electricity to be generated at a customer's home and sent to the grid for electricity suppliers to use to meet other customers' electricity needs. Storage systems allow residential customers to store electricity from the grid or their own solar system for use at a later time. Furthermore, customers can use smart devices, such as thermostats, to manage their electricity consumption. GAO was asked to provide information on the deployment and use of technologies that give customers the ability to generate, store, and manage electricity. This report describes (1) key federal and state policies used to encourage the deployment of these technologies, (2) the extent to which these technologies are being deployed, and (3) the benefits and challenges of deploying these technologies. GAO analyzed available data on technology deployment from EIA and reviewed relevant reports and regulatory documents. GAO interviewed a non-generalizable sample of 46 government agencies and stakeholder organizations. This sample included state regulators and at least one electricity supplier from each of five states: Arizona, California, Hawaii, Minnesota, and New York, which were selected based on state policies and having high levels of technology deployment. GAO is not making recommendations in this report. Federal and state policymakers have used a range of policies to encourage the deployment of solar systems and other technologies that allow residential customers to generate, store, and manage their electricity consumption. For example, federal tax incentives\u2014such as the investment tax credit\u2014have reduced customers' up-front costs of installing solar systems. In addition, a Department of Energy funded database of renewable energy incentives identifies 41 states with net metering policies that require electricity suppliers to credit customers for electricity sent from their solar systems to the grid, providing an additional incentive. Moreover, in 14 states, customers can also receive state tax credits for installing solar systems, according to the database, which further reduces the up-front costs. According to GAO's analysis of Energy Information Administration (EIA) data, deployment of solar systems has increased significantly in some states, with the total number of residential customers with solar systems increasing sevenfold from 2010 to 2015. However, customers with solar systems represent a very small portion of overall electricity customers\u2014about 0.7 percent of U.S. residential customers in 2015, according to EIA data. Every state experienced growth in the number of customers with residential solar systems, although certain states, such as California and Hawaii, accounted for most of the growth and have had more widespread deployment. For example, about 14 percent of residences in Hawaii have installed a solar system, according to EIA data. Although comprehensive data on the deployment of electricity storage systems and smart devices are not available, the data and information provided by stakeholders GAO interviewed suggest their deployment is limited. The increasing residential deployment of solar systems and other technologies poses potential benefits and challenges, and some policymakers have implemented or are considering measures to address these, as GAO found in its analysis of reports and stakeholder interviews. Specifically, these technologies can provide potential benefits through more efficient grid operation, for example, if customers use these technologies to reduce their consumption of electricity from the grid during periods of high demand. Nonetheless, grid operators GAO interviewed said they have begun to confront grid management and other challenges in some areas as solar deployment increases. For example, in some areas of Hawaii, solar systems have generated more electricity than the grid was built to handle, which resulted in the need for infrastructure upgrades in these areas. However, grid operators reported that challenges generally have been manageable because overall residential solar deployment has been low. Policymakers in some states have implemented or are considering measures to maximize potential benefits and mitigate potential challenges associated with the increasing deployment of these technologies. For example, two states' regulators have required electricity suppliers to identify areas of the grid where solar and other technologies would be most beneficial to grid operation. In addition, several state regulators recently have allowed electricity suppliers to adopt voluntary time-based electricity prices that increase when demand for electricity is high, providing customers with an incentive to reduce consumption at these times, potentially by using solar, storage, and other technologies.", "The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) continues to respond to hurricanes Katrina and Rita. GAO's previous work identified suspected fraud, waste, and abuse resulting from control weaknesses associated with FEMA's Individuals and Households Program (IHP) and the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) purchase card program. Congress asked GAO to follow up on this previous work to determine whether potentially improper and/or fraudulent payments continued to be made. GAO testified on the results of our audit and investigative efforts on December 6, 2006. This report summarizes the results of our follow-up work. In our December 6, 2006, testimony, GAO stated that FEMA made tens of millions of dollars of potentially improper and/or fraudulent payments associated with both hurricanes Katrina and Rita. These payments include $17 million in rental assistance paid to individuals to whom FEMA had already provided free housing through trailers or apartments. In one case, FEMA provided free housing to 10 individuals in apartments in Plano, Texas, while at the same time it sent these individuals $46,000 to cover out-of-pocket housing expenses. In addition, several of these individuals certified to FEMA that they needed rental assistance. FEMA made nearly $20 million in duplicate payments to thousands of individuals who claimed damages to the same property from both hurricanes Katrina and Rita. FEMA also made millions in potentially improper and/or fraudulent payments to nonqualified aliens who were not eligible for IHP. For example, FEMA paid at least $3 million to more than 500 ineligible foreign students at four universities in the affected areas. This amount likely understates the total payments to ineligible foreign students because it does not cover all colleges and universities in the area. FEMA also provided potentially improper and/or fraudulent IHP assistance to other ineligible non-U.S. residents, despite having documentation indicating their ineligibility. Finally, FEMA's difficulties in identifying and collecting improper payments further emphasized the importance of implementing an effective fraud, waste, and abuse prevention system. For example, GAO previously estimated improper and potentially fraudulent payments related to the IHP application process to be $1 billion through February 2006. As of November 2006, FEMA identified about $290 million in overpayments and collected about $7 million. Finally, GAO's work on DHS purchase cards showed continuing problems with property accountability, including items GAO investigated that could not be located 1 year after they were purchased.", "The Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund in the Department of the Treasury has awarded $21 billion of the $26 billion in New Markets Tax Credits (NMTC) authorized to be awarded to Community Development Entities (CDE) between 2001 and 2009. CDEs use the NMTC to make qualified investments in low-income communities. Recent congressional interest has focused on participation by minority CDEs. This testimony is based on a recent GAO report (GAO-09-536). As requested, the report (1) identified the number of minority and non-minority CDEs that applied to the CDFI Fund and received NMTC awards, (2) explained the process by which the CDFI Fund makes awards and summarized application scores, (3) described challenges minority and non-minority CDEs face in applying for and receiving awards and, (4) identified efforts the CDFI Fund and others have taken to assist minority CDEs in applying for awards. GAO analyzed CDFI Fund application data and interviewed officials from minority and non-minority CDEs, the CDFI Fund, and industry groups. From 2005 through 2008, minority-owned CDEs were successful with about 9 percent of the NMTC applications that they submitted to the CDFI Fund and received about $354 million of the $8.7 billion for which they applied, or about 4 percent. Non-minority CDEs were successful with about 27 percent of their applications and received $13.2 billion of the $89.7 billion for which they applied, or about 15 percent. Since GAO issued the report on which this statement is based, the CDFI Fund made 32 NMTC awards totaling $1.5 billion under authority provided in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Minority CDEs received 3 of those awards, totaling $135 million. The CDFI Fund relies primarily on its scoring of applications to determine which CDEs receive awards. As the figure shows, minority CDEs received lower scores than non-minority CDEs in each of the four application sections. Although a CDE's resources and experience in applying are important factors in a CDE's success rate with the NMTC program, when controlling for factors that GAO could measure, minority status is associated with a lower probability of receiving an allocation. It is not clear from GAO's analysis why this relationship exists or whether any actions taken or not taken by the Department of the Treasury contributed to minority CDEs' lower probability of success. Characteristics associated with minority status of some CDEs for which data are unavailable may affect this relationship. If Congress views increased participation by minority CDEs as a goal for the NMTC program, options, such as providing certain preferences in the application process that may benefit minority CDEs, could be considered. The CDFI Fund provides assistance that is available to all CDEs applying for awards, including a written debriefing to CDEs that do not receive awards detailing some of the weaknesses in the applications. Other stakeholders, including industry associations and consultants, hold conferences and offer services to help CDEs submit competitive applications. Should Congress view additional assistance to minority CDEs as important to increasing minority CDEs' participation in the NMTC program, it could consider requiring the CDFI Fund to provide assistance to minority CDEs.", "The joint federal-state unemployment insurance program is the Department of Labor's largest income maintenance program, and its benefits provide a critical source of income for millions of unemployed Americans. The program is overseen by Labor and administered by the states. To administer their UI programs, states rely heavily on IT systems--both to collect and process revenue from taxes and to determine eligibility and administer benefits. However, many of these systems are aging and were developed using outdated computer programming languages, making them costly and difficult to support and incapable of efficiently handling increasing workloads. Given the importance of IT to state agencies' ability to process and administer benefits, GAO was asked to provide testimony summarizing aspects of its September 2012 report on UI modernization, including key challenges states have encountered in modernizing their tax and benefit systems. To develop this statement, GAO relied on its previously published work. As GAO reported in September 2012, nine selected states had made varying degrees of progress in modernizing the information technology (IT) systems supporting their unemployment insurance (UI) programs. Specifically, the states' modernization efforts were at various stages--three were in early phases of defining business needs and requirements, two were in the process of building systems based on identified requirements, two were in a \"mixed\" phase of having a system that was partly operational and partly in development, and two had systems that were completely operational. The enhancements provided by these systems included supporting web-based technologies with more modern databases and replacing outdated programming languages, among others. Nevertheless, while taking steps to modernize their systems, the selected states reported encountering a number of challenges, including the following: Limited funding and the increasing cost of UI systems . The recent economic downturn resulted in smaller state budgets, limiting what could be spent on UI system modernization. In addition, competing demands and fluctuating budgets made planning for system development, which can take several years, more difficult. A lack of sufficient expertise among staff . Selected states reported that they had insufficient staff with expertise in UI program rules and requirements, the ability to maintain IT systems developed by vendors, and knowledge of current programming languages needed to maintain modernized systems. A need to continue to operate legacy systems while simultaneously implementing new systems . This required states to balance scarce resources between these two efforts. In addition, a separate set of challenges arose for states participating in multistate consortiums, which were established to pool resources for developing joint systems that could be used by all member states: Differences in state laws and business processes impacted the effort to design and develop a common system. States within a consortium differed on the best approach for developing and modernizing systems and found it difficult to reach consensus. Decision making by consortium leadership raised concerns about liability for outcomes that could negatively affect member states. Consortiums found it difficult to obtain a qualified leader for a multistate effort who was unbiased and independent. Both consortium and individual state officials had taken steps intended to mitigate challenges. GAO also noted that a comprehensive assessment of lessons learned could further assist states' efforts. In addition, the states in GAO's review had established certain IT management controls that can help successfully guide modernization efforts. These controls include establishing a project management office, using industry-standard project management guidance, and employing IT investment management standards, among others. In its prior report on states' UI system modernization efforts, GAO recommended that the Department of Labor conduct an assessment of lessons learned and distribute the analysis to states through an information-sharing platform such as a website. Labor agreed with the first recommendation; it neither agreed nor disagreed with the second recommendation, but stated that it was committed to sharing lessons learned.", "Over the last few years, billions of dollars have been collected in fines, penalties, and forfeitures assessed against financial institutions for violations of requirements related to financial crimes. These requirements are significant tools that help the federal government detect and disrupt money laundering, terrorist financing, bribery, corruption, and violations of U.S. sanctions programs. GAO was asked to review the collection and use of these fines, penalties, and forfeitures assessed against financial institutions for violations of these requirements\u2014specifically, BSA/AML, FCPA, and U.S. sanctions programs requirements. This report describes (1) the amounts collected by the federal government for these violations, and (2) the process for collecting these funds and the purposes for which they are used. GAO analyzed agency data, reviewed documentation on agency collection processes and on authorized uses of the funds in which collections are deposited, and reviewed relevant laws. GAO also interviewed officials from Treasury (including the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and the Office of Foreign Assets Control), Securities and Exchange Commission, Department of Justice, and the federal banking regulators. GAO is not making recommendations in this report. Since 2009, financial institutions have been assessed about $12 billion in fines, penalties, and forfeitures for violations of Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money- laundering regulations (BSA/AML), Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA), and U.S. sanctions programs requirements by the federal government. Specifically, GAO found that from January 2009 to December 2015, federal agencies assessed about $5.2 billion for BSA/AML violations, $27 million for FCPA violations, and about $6.8 billion for violations of U.S. sanctions program requirements. Of the $12 billion, federal agencies have collected all of these assessments, except for about $100 million. Collections of Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures from Financial Institutions for Violations of Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and U.S. Sanctions Programs Requirements, Assessed in January 2009\u2013December 2015 Agencies have processes for collecting payments for violations of BSA/AML, FCPA, and U.S. sanctions programs requirements and these collections can be used to support general government and law enforcement activities and provide payments to crime victims. Components within the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and financial regulators are responsible for initially collecting penalty payments, verifying that the correct amount has been paid, and then depositing the funds into Treasury's General Fund accounts, after which the funds are available for appropriation and use for general support of the government. Of the approximately $11.9 billion collected, about $2.7 billion was deposited into Treasury General Fund accounts. The BSA and U.S. sanctions-related criminal cases GAO identified since 2009 resulted in the forfeiture of almost $9 billion through the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Treasury. Of this amount, about $3.2 billion was deposited into DOJ's Asset Forfeiture Fund (AFF) and $5.7 billion into the Treasury Forfeiture Fund (TFF), of which $3.8 billion related to a sanctions case was rescinded in fiscal year 2016 appropriations legislation. Funds from the AFF and TFF are primarily used for program expenses, payments to third parties, including the victims of the related crimes, and payments to law enforcement agencies that participated in the efforts resulting in forfeitures. As of December 2015, DOJ and Treasury had distributed about $1.1 billion to law enforcement agencies and about $2 billion was planned for distribution to crime victims. Remaining funds from these cases are subject to general rescissions to the TFF and AFF or may be used for program or other law enforcement expenses.", "This testimony discusses the Preparedness Against Domestic Terrorism Act of 2001 (H.R. 525). To improve federal efforts to help state and local personnel prepare for domestic terrorist attacks, H.R. 525 would create a single focal point for policy and coordination--the President's Council on Domestic Terrorism Preparedness--within the White House. The new council would include the President, several cabinet secretaries, and other selected high-level officials. H.R. 525 would (1) create an executive director position with a staff that would collaborate with other executive agencies to assess threats, (2) require the new council to develop a national strategy, (3) require the new council to analyze and review budgets, and (4) require the new council to oversee implementation among the different federal agencies. Other proposals before Congress would also create a single focal point for terrorism. Some of these proposals place the focal point in the Executive Office of the President and others place it in a lead executive agency. Both locations have advantages and disadvantages.", "In September 1999, the government of Colombia announced a strategy, known as \"Plan Colombia,\" to (1) reduce the production of illicit drugs (primarily cocaine) by 50 percent in 6 years and (2) improve security in Colombia by re-claiming control of areas held by illegal armed groups. Since fiscal year 2000, the United States has provided over $6 billion to support Plan Colombia. The Departments of State, Defense, and Justice and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) manage the assistance. GAO examined (1) the progress made toward Plan Colombia's drug reduction and enhanced security objectives, (2) the results of U.S. aid for the military and police, (3) the results of U.S. aid for non-military programs, and (4) the status of efforts to \"nationalize\" or transfer operations and funding responsibilities for U.S.-supported programs to Colombia. Plan Colombia's goal of reducing the cultivation, processing, and distribution of illegal narcotics by 50 percent in 6 years was not fully achieved. From 2000 to 2006, opium poppy cultivation and heroin production declined about 50 percent, while coca cultivation and cocaine production levels increased by about 15 and 4 percent, respectively. These increases, in part, can be explained by measures taken by coca farmers to counter U.S. and Colombian eradication efforts. Colombia has improved its security climate through systematic military and police engagements with illegal armed groups and by degrading these groups' finances. U.S. Embassy Bogot? officials cautioned that these security gains will not be irreversible until illegal armed groups can no longer threaten the stability of the government of Colombia, but become a law enforcement problem requiring only police attention. Since fiscal year 2000, State and Defense provided nearly $4.9 billion to the Colombian military and National Police. Notably, over 130 U.S.-funded helicopters have provided the air mobility needed to rapidly move Colombian counternarcotics and counterinsurgency forces. U.S. advisors, training, equipment, and intelligence assistance have also helped professionalize Colombia's military and police forces, which have recorded a number of achievements including the aerial and manual eradication of hundreds of thousands of hectares of coca, the seizure of tons of cocaine, and the capture or killing of a number of illegal armed group leaders and thousands of combatants. However, these efforts face several challenges, including countermeasures taken by coca farmers to combat U.S. and Colombian eradication efforts. Since fiscal year 2000, State, Justice, and USAID have provided nearly $1.3 billion for a wide range of social, economic, and justice sector programs. These programs have had a range of accomplishments, including aiding internally displaced persons and reforming Colombia's justice sector. But some efforts have been slow in achieving their objectives while others are difficult to assess. For example, the largest share of U.S. non-military assistance has gone towards alternative development, which has provided hundreds of thousands of Colombians legal economic alternatives to the illicit drug trade. But, alternative development is not provided in most areas where coca is cultivated and USAID does not assess how such programs relate to its strategic goals of reducing the production of illicit drugs or achieving sustainable results. In response to congressional direction in 2005 and budget cuts in fiscal year 2008, State and the other U.S. departments and agencies have accelerated their nationalization efforts, with State focusing on Colombian military and National Police aviation programs. One aviation program has been nationalized and two are in transition, with the largest--the Army Aviation Brigade--slated for turnover by 2012. Two National Police aviation programs have no turnover dates established. State, Defense, Justice, and USAID each have their own approaches to nationalization, with different timelines and objectives that have not been coordinated to promote potential efficiencies.", "Title III of the proposed Homeland Security Act of 2002 would transfer responsibility for certain chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear research and development programs and activities to the new department. The proposed Department of Homeland Security would develop national policy for, and coordination of, the federal government's civilian research and development efforts to counter chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats. Although the new department could improve coordination of existing research and development programs, the proposed transfer of control and priority setting for research from the organizations where the research would be conducted could be disruptive. Transferring control over these programs, including priority setting, to the new department has the potential to disrupt some programs that are critical to basic public health. The President's proposal is not clear on how both the homeland security and the biomedical research objectives would be accomplished. However, if an agency's mission fits with homeland security, its transfer to the new department is appropriate.", "Despite a growing investment in space, the majority of large-scale acquisition programs in the Department of Defense's (DOD) space portfolio have experienced problems during the past two decades that have driven up cost and schedules and increased technical risks. The cost resulting from acquisition problems along with the ambitious nature of space programs have resulted in cancellations of programs that were expected to require investments of tens of billions of dollars. Along with the cost increases, many programs are experiencing significant schedule delays--as much as 7 years--resulting in potential capability gaps in areas such as positioning, navigation, and timing; missile warning; and weather monitoring. This testimony focuses on (3) the condition of space acquisitions, (1) causal factors, (2) observations on the space industrial base, and (4) recommendations for better positioning programs and industry for success. In preparing this testimony, GAO relied on its body of work in space and other programs, including previously issued GAO reports on assessments of individual space programs, common problems affecting space system acquisitions, and DOD's acquisition policies. Estimated costs for major space acquisition programs have increased by about $10.9 billion from initial estimates for fiscal years 2008 through 2013. As seen in the figure below, in several cases, DOD has had to cut back on quantity and capability in the face of escalating costs. Several causes behind the cost growth and related problems consistently stand out. First, DOD starts more weapon programs than it can afford, creating a competition for funding that encourages, among other things, low cost estimating and optimistic scheduling. Second, DOD has tended to start its space programs before it has the assurance that the capabilities it is pursuing can be achieved within available resources. GAO and others have identified a number of pressures associated with the contractors that develop space systems for the government that have hampered the acquisition process, including ambitious requirements, the impact of industry consolidation, and shortages of technical expertise in the workforce. Although DOD has taken a number of actions to address the problems on which GAO has reported, additional leadership and support are still needed to ensure that reforms that DOD has begun will take hold.", "More than 3 years have passed since Treasury made up to $50 billion available to help struggling homeowners through the MHA program, and foreclosure rates remain near historically high levels. Further, more than 2 years after Treasury set up the Hardest Hit Fund to help homeowners in high-unemployment states, much of the money remains unspent. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which authorized Treasury to create TARP, requires GAO to report every 60 days on TARP activities. This 60-day report examines (1) the steps Treasury took to design and implement recent changes to MHA, and (2) Treasury\u0092s monitoring and oversight of states\u0092 implementation of Hardest Hit Fund programs. To address these questions, GAO analyzed data and interviewed officials from Treasury, five selected Hardest Hit Fund states, and five large MHA servicers. The Department of the Treasury announced changes in January 2012 to its Making Home Affordable (MHA) programs, which are funded by the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), to address barriers to borrower participation. These changes include expanding eligibility criteria and extending application deadlines through 2013. Not enough time has passed to assess the extent to which these changes will increase participation. Several large servicers were not able to fully implement the changes by the June 1, 2012, effective date, and servicers that GAO queried had mixed views about possible effects. Treasury consulted with servicers, investors, and federal banking regulators before implementing the changes but did not perform a comprehensive risk assessment for the changes or develop meaningful performance measures in accordance with standards for internal control. As a result, Treasury may have difficulty mitigating potential risks, such as an increase in redefaults or the misuse of funds; effectively assessing program outcomes; or holding servicers accountable. After a slow start, states increased their spending on borrower assistance under the Housing Finance Agency Innovation Fund for the Hardest Hit Housing Markets (Hardest Hit Fund). The assistance provided as of March 2012 totaled about 5 percent of the $7.6 billion allocation. All but one state that GAO spoke to anticipated spending their full allocations, and all noted that with Treasury\u0092s help they had dealt with challenges related to staffing, infrastructure, servicer participation, borrower outreach, and program implementation. Treasury officials said that they expected initial administrative spending to be high as states established their programs, and 27 percent of states\u0092 total spending was for administrative expenses as of March 2012. Treasury officials stated that states would be required to report publicly on administrative costs beginning with the third quarter of 2012. Treasury has been monitoring states\u0092 performance and compliance but has not reported consolidated performance and financial data (including administrative expenses) for the programs. The lack of consolidated reporting of performance and financial data limits transparency and efforts to ensure that resources are used effectively to achieve program goals. Treasury should (1) expeditiously assess the risks associated with the recent changes to MHA and develop activity-level performance measures for each program, and (2) consolidate the states\u0092 Hardest Hit Fund performance and financial data, including administrative expenses, into a single public report. Treasury neither agreed nor disagreed with the recommendations but took exception to the finding that it did not conduct a comprehensive risk assessment prior to implementing the MHA program changes. In response, GAO provided examples of key components of a comprehensive risk assessment that Treasury had not addressed.", "Pursuant to a congressional request, GAO reviewed the Department of State's efforts to improve the management of its embassies, focusing on whether State has responded to previous recommendations concerning embassy management. GAO found that: (1) State has not responded to the recommendation that it establish proactive management improvement programs at its overseas posts because it believes that its approach of targeting specific areas for improvement is more appropriate and achieves comparable longterm results; (2) State has initiated action on some congressional recommendations to improve its embassy management, but deficiencies continue in controls over personal property, training for U.S. and foreign service personnel, contracting and procurement practices, controls over cashiering functions and medical insurance reimbursements, and senior-level oversight; (3) the embassies in Turkey, Bangladesh, and Tunisia have initiated management practices, such as tracking accounts receivable, automating travel vouchers, strengthening internal controls, improving regulation compliance, reducing costs, and enhancing efficiency and effectiveness; and (4) embassy senior managers participate in the day to day operations of their posts and use existing reporting requirements to document administrative problems and decide on appropriate corrective actions.", "To improve outcomes for youth leaving foster care, Congress passed the Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 (FCIA), which increased the allocation of federal funds for independent living programs from $70 million to $140 million. This report reviews (1) how states' funding allocations changed to serve youth after FCIA, (2) the extent to which states have expanded services and age groups of foster youth served since the passage of FCIA and what challenges remain, (3) the extent to which states have used other federal and state programs to coordinate the delivery of services to foster youth, and (4) how the states and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have fulfilled the program accountability provisions of the law and assessed the effectiveness of independent living services. The doubling of federal funding for independent living programs has resulted in most states receiving an increase in funds. Although some states had difficulty expanding their program infrastructure in the first 2 years of increased funding, the amount of funds states returned to HHS declined the second year. Differences in funding also appeared in the amounts available per eligible foster care youth. Following the passage of FCIA, 40 states reported in our survey expanding independent living services to younger youth, and 36 states expanded services to older youth, but gaps remain in providing some key services to youth. State differences in serving youth may have been caused by gaps in the availability of critical services, such as mental health services, mentoring, and housing, as well as challenges engaging youth and foster parents to participate in the program. Almost all states that we surveyed reported increased levels of coordination under FCIA, but linkages with other federal and state youth-serving programs were not always in place to increase services available across local areas. Despite some coordination efforts, states may not make full use of available resources. One of the barriers in linking program services reported by the 4 states we visited included the inconsistent availability of information on the array of programs that were operating in each state and local area. States and HHS have taken action to fulfill the accountability provisions of FCIA, but little information is available to assess the effectiveness of independent living services. All states submitted required plans and reports, but the absence of a uniform reporting format and lack of standard monitoring practices among HHS regional offices hindered assessments of state performance. HHS is developing an information system that may improve program accountability and reported that it expects to issue a proposed regulation in 2005.", "Enacted in January 2006, IMBRA was passed by Congress to address reports of domestic violence and abuse of foreign beneficiaries married or engaged to U.S. citizens who have petitioned for them to enter the United States on a K visa. As amended, IMBRA requires that the federal government collect and provide to beneficiaries information about petitioners' prior K visa petitions and criminal histories. USCIS is responsible for collecting this information and adjudicating petitions, State is responsible for disclosing information to beneficiaries, and DOJ is authorized to enforce IMBRA. The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 mandates that GAO report on IMBRA implementation. This report examines the extent to which (1) DHS, State, and DOJ have implemented processes to ensure compliance with IMBRA, and (2) DHS collects and maintains reliable data to manage the K visa process. GAO analyzed IMBRA, USCIS, and State policies, procedures, and guidance, and K visa petition data from March 2012 through March 2014. GAO also interviewed USCIS, State, and DOJ officials regarding their agencies' implementation of IMBRA. The Departments of Homeland Security (DHS), Justice (DOJ), and State (State) have processes to help ensure compliance with the International Marriage Broker Regulation Act of 2005 (IMBRA), as amended, but State could better document information on IMBRA disclosures. Specifically, consistent with IMBRA, DHS's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) collects information from petitioners\u2014U.S. citizens who apply to bring noncitizen fianc\u00e9(e)s, spouses, and their children (beneficiaries) into the country\u2014through I-129F petitions for K visas. DOJ is responsible for pursuing federal civil and criminal penalties for IMBRA violations. State has guidance on processes for providing IMBRA information to beneficiaries (referred to as disclosures), such as a pamphlet outlining for beneficiaries the K visa process and legal rights and resources available to immigrant crime victims. Specifically, State's guidance requires consular officers to document within case notes in State's database whether they made all of the IMBRA-required disclosures to the beneficiary during the visa interview. However, GAO's review of a sample of K visa applications showed that in about 52 percent of interview case notes (76 of 147), consular officers did not document that they had provided beneficiaries the IMBRA pamphlet as required by State's guidance. In October 2014, State drafted a guidance cable for consular officers on IMBRA implementation, including a reminder to follow guidance regarding IMBRA documentation. State's consular officer training courses, however, do not cover IMBRA-related documentation procedures outlined in its guidance. Incorporating IMBRA-related documentation requirements into training courses could help State better ensure that consular officers are aware of the requirements for documenting IMBRA disclosures. Consistent with IMBRA, USCIS is to collect and maintain data on, among other things, eight elements in the K visa process for GAO reporting purposes; however, six of the eight elements are either not reliable or are not collected or maintained in a reportable (i.e., electronic) format. Thus, these elements were not readily available for GAO's review. For example, USCIS is to collect and maintain data on I-129F petitions where the petitioner had one or more criminal convictions. This information is maintained in hard copy in the petition file and thus was not readily available for GAO's review. USCIS has begun planning to electronically capture I-129F petition data under the agency's overarching transformation to an electronic immigration benefits system. However, this transformation has faced significant delays, and as of September 2014, the electronic I-129F petition design requirements have not been finalized. Consistent with federal internal control standards, ensuring that all of the IMBRA-related requirements will be captured with the release of the I-129F electronic petition would better position USCIS to collect and maintain complete data on petitioners for reporting purposes and management oversight. Further, USCIS officers have not consistently adjudicated I-129F petitions or recorded complete and accurate data. Specifically, GAO found that USCIS's data are not reliable for determining the number of I-129F petitions filed by persons who have previously filed I-129F petitions for a fianc\u00e9(e) or spouse or that required IMBRA waivers because of, among other things, officer error in recording data on petitions. Additional training for officers could help USCIS better ensure its officers are aware of IMBRA requirements to assist them in maintaining petitions data consistent with IMBRA. GAO recommends that State provide training to consular officers on IMBRA documentation requirements. GAO also recommends, among other things, that USCIS ensure that all IMBRA-related data will be captured with the planned electronic release of the I-129F petition and that its officers receive additional training on IMBRA requirements. State and DHS concurred with our recommendations.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) lacks management control of the Standard Procurement System (SPS). DOD has not (1) ensured that accountability and responsibility for measuring progress against commitments are clearly understood, performed, and reported; (2) demonstrated, on the basis of reliable data and credible analysis, that the proposed system solution will produce economic benefits commensurate with costs; (3) used data on progress against project cost, schedule, and performance commitments throughout a project's life cycle to make investment decisions; and (4) divided this large project into a series of incremental investment decisions to spread the risks over smaller, more manageable components. GAO found that DOD lacks the basic information needed to make informed decisions on how to proceed with the project. Nevertheless, DOD continues to push forward in acquiring and deploying additional versions of SPS. This testimony summarizes a July report (GAO-01-682).", "Indian tribes' participation in NFIP is extremely low, even though some Indian lands are at high risk of flooding. In response to a Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act mandate, GAO examined (1) factors affecting Indian tribes' participation in NFIP, (2) FEMA's efforts to increase tribes' participation in NFIP, and (3) administrative and legislative actions that could increase tribes' participation. GAO reviewed FEMA data on community participation in NFIP and prior GAO reports on flood insurance and Indian tribes, interviewed officials from selected Indian tribes and insurance companies, and collected information from relevant agencies and industry officials. As of August 2012, just 37 of 566 federally recognized tribes (7 percent) were participating in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), and 3 tribes accounted for more than 70 percent of policies. A number of factors have affected tribes' participation. First, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has not placed a high priority on mapping rural areas, including many Indian lands, for flood risk, and most tribal lands remain unmapped. Without flood hazard maps, tribal communities may be unaware of their flood risk, even in high-risk areas. Partly for this reason, the risk of flooding is perceived as relatively low on many tribal lands. Further, tribes may lack the resources and administrative capacity needed to administer NFIP requirements, and NFIP premiums are often too high for low-income tribal members. Finally, unique tribal issues can make participation difficult. For example, some Indian tribes do not have reservations over which they can enact and enforce the land use ordinances that are required for NFIP participation. Instead, many have lands that were allotted to individuals rather than to a tribal entity, limiting the tribes' jurisdiction. FEMA has done some outreach to tribes, largely through emergency management and homeland security training for tribal officials, technical assistance to tribes that are preparing their multihazard mitigation plans, and marketing through the NFIP FloodSmart campaign. FEMA officials told us that the courses offered through its Emergency Management Institute helped to educate tribal officials about NFIP and floodplain management and that its curricula included courses for floodplain managers on their roles and responsibilities, flood insurance, and NFIP rules and regulations. One tribal representative told us that he was participating in an ongoing curriculum and several tribes had developed multihazard mitigation plans. Finally, both the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Rural Development may provide NFIP information to Indian tribes as they provide assistance in the form of housing and infrastructure grants, loans, and loan guarantees. Tribal representatives suggested steps that FEMA could take to encourage participation in NFIP--for example, placing a higher priority on mapping Indian lands and increasing FloodSmart marketing to tribal leaders rather than individuals. Given ongoing congressional interest in private sector alternatives to NFIP, GAO also explored whether private alternatives exist that could offer affordable coverage to low-income tribal members--for example, by expanding access to risk-pooling programs that could help insure more tribal households. One such program already insures thousands of Indian properties. Another relatively new product, microinsurance, would involve insurers offering less expensive policies with relatively low coverage limits but coverage for all tribes. FEMA said that its NFIP privatization study mandated by the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 would include an assessment of these alternatives. GAO recommends that the FEMA Administrator examine ways to make mapping of tribal lands in flood-prone areas a higher priority. FEMA agreed with our recommendation.", "The Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-315, mandated GAO to study the financial and compliance audits and reviews required or conducted for the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program and the Federal Direct Student Loan (DL) program. The Department of Education's (Education) Office of Federal Student Aid is responsible for administering these programs. This report focuses on (1) identifying differences and similarities in audit requirements and oversight procedures for the FFEL and DL programs, including anticipated changes to selected oversight activities and (2) describing how the Office of Federal Student Aid's policies and procedures are designed to monitor audits and reviews. To do so, GAO interviewed Education and inspector general officials and reviewed numerous audit guides, agency procedures, checklists, and audit tracking systems. GAO identified differences and similarities in audit requirements and oversight procedures for the two programs. Differences include the following: (1) The FFEL and DL programs generally had different audit requirements stemming primarily from divergent program structures. The FFEL program relied on lenders, guaranty agencies--which administer federal government loan guarantees to lenders--and other entities that were subject to statutory and regulatory audit requirements. The DL program did not have as many audit requirements because DL loans are provided by the federal government, and fewer external entities are involved. (2) GAO found differences in audit requirements for nonprofit and for-profit lenders. Certain applicable audit objectives included in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requirements for compliance audits of nonprofit lenders were not included in the Department of Education Office of Inspector General (OIG) Lender Audit Guide for compliance audits of for-profit lenders. As a result, audits of lenders performed in accordance with the OIG Lender Audit Guide were at risk of omitting compliance testing for a key audit objective. Similarities in audit requirements and oversight procedures include these: (1) Schools were subject to annual financial statement and compliance audits under both programs. (2) The functions performed by the DL servicer, with which Education contracts to administer certain functions of the DL program, were similar to functions performed by lenders, guaranty agencies, and their servicers in the FFEL program. GAO's analysis found that objectives addressed by FFEL participant compliance audits were similar to the objectives addressed through oversight procedures for the DL servicer, such as Education's review of the servicer's monthly performance metrics. The passage of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 terminated the authority to make new FFEL loans after June 30, 2010. Borrowers who would have been eligible to obtain new FFEL loans could receive loans under the DL program. Regarding Office of Federal Student Aid's monitoring activities, staff were to use financial statement audits to oversee the financial condition of the schools and guaranty agencies that participate in the student loan programs. Compliance audits of schools, lenders, guaranty agencies, and their third-party servicers help Education ensure that these participants comply with applicable statutes, regulations, and program requirements. The Office of Federal Student Aid was required to track findings in these audit reports. GAO found that third-party servicers for lenders in the FFEL program did not submit their audited financial statements to Education as required. Education lacked a policy and specific procedures to ensure receipt and review of these audited financial statements. Without such reviews, the Office of Federal Student Aid might not be informed of a third-party servicer's unfavorable audit opinion or significant reported findings that could affect program operations. GAO recommends that the Education Inspector General update the OIG Lender Audit Guide to include all appropriate regulatory requirements for audits of ongoing FFEL participants. GAO also recommends that the Secretary of Education develop and implement policies and procedures requiring Office of Federal Student Aid review of audited financial statements for lender servicers. The Education Office of Inspector General and Education agreed with GAO's recommendations.", "This report reviews the challenges facing U.S. agricultural biotechnology products in international trade. GAO found that new regulations and guidelines that may restrict U.S. exports of crops with a large biotech component are being enacted or considered by some U.S. trading partners and are also under discussion in various international organizations. These actions address approval, labeling, and traceability of agricultural biotech products. U.S. corn and soybean exports are most threatened by new foreign regulatory measures because of their biotech content. Although U.S. soybean exports have not yet experienced disruptions, U.S. corn exports have been largely shut out of the European Union (EU) market because U.S. farmers are producing some biotech varieties that have not been approved for marketing in the EU. U.S. agricultural biotech exports face several significant challenges in international markets. First, as the single major producer of biotech products, the United States has been relatively isolated in its efforts to maintain access to markets for these products. Second, in many parts of the world, consumer concerns are growing about the safety of biotech foods, which have led key market countries to implement or consider regulations that may restrict U.S. biotech exports. Another challenge is that U.S. industry combines conventional and biotech grain in the distribution chain. Consequently, foreign regulations governing biotech varieties could affect all U.S. exports of these commodities. Finally, as international negotiations in Codex Alimentarius and elsewhere take on greater importance, the U.S. government faces increasing demands for staff resources and coordination among the multiple agencies involved in biotech trade issues.", "GAO discussed: (1) the extent to which federal controls ensure that food importers present shipments for inspection when required and that shipments refused entry are destroyed or reexported; and (2) ways to strengthen these controls. GAO noted that: (1) the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) controls provide little assurance that shipments targeted for inspection are actually inspected or that shipments found to violate U.S. safety standards are destroyed or reexported; (2) because importers, rather than FDA, retain custody over shipments throughout the import process, some importers have been able to provide substitutes for products targeted for inspection or products that have been refused entry and must be reexported or destroyed, according to Customs Service and FDA officials; (3) moreover, Customs and FDA do not effectively coordinate their efforts to ensure that importers are notified that their refused shipments must be reexported or destroyed; (4) Customs' penalties for violating inspection and disposal requirements may provide little incentive for compliance because they are too low in comparison with the value of the imported products or they are not imposed at all; (5) as a result of these weaknesses, shipments that failed to meet U.S. safety standards were distributed in domestic commerce; (6) because the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) requires unique identification marks on, and maintains custody of, each shipment of imported foods under its jurisdiction, GAO did not find similar weaknesses in FSIS' controls over the shipments reviewed, although GAO did identify some coordination problems between FSIS and Customs; (7) federal controls would be strengthened by consistently implementing current procedures and by adopting new procedures; (8) Customs and FDA officials and representatives of importer and broker associations identified a number of ways to improve agencies' controls over incoming shipments, strengthen interagency coordination, and provide stronger deterrents against repeat violators; and (9) each of these approaches has advantages and disadvantages that should be considered before making any changes.", "In March of this year, GAO testified before the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Committee on Veterans' Affairs, about the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) information technology (IT) program, and the strides that the Secretary had made in improving departmental leadership and management of this critical area--including the hiring of a chief information officer. At the Subcommittee's request, GAO evaluated VA's new IT organizational structure, and provided an update on VA's progress in addressing other specific areas of IT concern and our related recommendations pertaining to enterprise architecture, information security, the Veterans Benefits Administration's replacement compensation and pension payment system and maintenance of the Benefits Delivery Network, and the government computer-based patient record initiative. Since our March testimony, VA has made important progress in its overall management of information technology. For example, the Secretary's decision to centralize IT functions, programs, and funding under the department-level CIO holds great promise for improving the accountability and management of IT spending--currently over $1 billion per year. But in this as well as the other areas of prior weakness, the strength of VA's leadership and continued management commitment to achieving improvements will ultimately determine the department's degree of success. As for its progress in other areas includes: enterprise architecture: the Secretary recently approved the initial, \"as is\" version of this blueprint for evolving its information systems, focused on defining the department's current environment for selected business functions. VA still, however, needs to select a permanent chief architect and establish a program office to facilitate, manage, and advance this effort. Information security: steps have been taken that should help provide a more solid foundation for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents. Nonetheless, the department has not yet fully implemented a comprehensive computer security management program that includes a process for routinely monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of security policies and controls, acting to address identified vulnerabilities. Compensation and pension payment system: while some actions have been taken, after more than 6 years, full implementation of this system is not envisioned before 2005; this means that the 3.5 million payments that VA makes each month will continue to depend on its present, aging system. Government computer-based patient record initiative: VA and the Department of Defense have reported some progress in achieving the capability to share patient health care data under this program. Since March, the agencies have formally re named the initiative the Federal Health Information Exchange and have begun implementing a more narrowly defined strategy involving a one-way information transfer from Defense to VA; a two-way exchange is planned by 2005.", "In April 2004, President Bush called for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop and implement a strategic plan to guide the nationwide implementation of health IT. The plan is to recommend methods to ensure the privacy of electronic health information. GAO was asked to summarize its report that is being released today. The report describes the steps HHS is taking to ensure privacy protection as part of its national health IT strategy and identifies challenges associated with protecting electronic health information exchanged within a nationwide health information network. HHS and its Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT have initiated actions to identify solutions for protecting personal health information through several contracts and with two health information advisory committees. For example, in late 2005, HHS awarded several health IT contracts that include requirements for addressing the privacy of personal health information exchanged within a nationwide health information exchange network. Its privacy and security solutions contractor is to assess the organization-level privacy- and security-related policies, practices, laws, and regulations that affect interoperable health information exchange. Additionally, in June 2006, the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics made recommendations to the Secretary of HHS on protecting the privacy of personal health information within a nationwide health information network and in August 2006, the American Health Information Community convened a work group to address privacy and security policy issues for nationwide health information exchange. While these activities are intended to address aspects of key principles for protecting the privacy of health information, HHS is in the early stages of its efforts and has therefore not yet defined an overall approach for integrating its various privacy-related initiatives and addressing key privacy principles, nor has it defined milestones for integrating the results of these activities. GAO identified key challenges associated with protecting electronic personal health information in four areas.", "Since 2001, Congress has appropriated about $640 billion for the global war on terrorism, the majority of this for operations in Iraq. In January 2007, the President announced The New Way Forward to stem violence in Iraq and enable the Iraqi government to foster national reconciliation. This new strategy established goals and objectives to achieve over 12 to 18 months, or by July 2008. GAO discusses progress in meeting key goals in The New Way Forward: (1) improve security conditions; (2) develop capable Iraqi security forces; and help the Iraqi government (3) enact key legislation, (4) spend capital budgets, and (5) provide essential services. GAO also discusses U.S. strategies for Iraq. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials from U.S. agencies, the United Nations, and the Iraqi government. GAO also had staff stationed in Baghdad. Since May 2003, GAO has issued over 130 Iraq-related audits, which provided baseline information for this assessment. GAO prepared this report under the Comptroller General's authority. The New Way Forward responded to failures in prior strategies that prematurely transferred security responsibilities to Iraqi forces or belatedly responded to growing sectarian violence. Overall violence, as measured by enemy-initiated attacks, fell about 70 percent in Iraq, from about 180 attacks per day in June 2007 to about 50 attacks per day in February 2008. Security gains have largely resulted from (1) the increase in U.S. combat forces, (2) the creation of nongovernmental security forces such as Sons of Iraq, and (3) the Mahdi Army's declaration of a cease fire. Average daily attacks were at higher levels in March and April before declining in May 2008. The security environment remains volatile and dangerous. The number of trained Iraqi forces has increased from 323,000 in January 2007 to 478,000 in May 2008; many units are leading counterinsurgency operations. However, the Department of Defense reported in March 2008 that the number of Iraqi units capable of performing operations without U.S. assistance has remained at about 10 percent. Several factors have complicated the development of capable security forces, including the lack of a single unified force, sectarian and militia influences, and continued dependence on U.S. and coalition forces. The Iraqi government has enacted key legislation to return some Ba'athists to government, give amnesty to detained Iraqis, and define provincial powers. However, it has not yet enacted other important legislation for sharing oil resources or holding provincial elections. Efforts to complete the constitutional review have also stalled. A goal of The New Way Forward was to facilitate the Iraqis' efforts to enact all key legislation by the end of 2007. Between 2005 and 2007, Iraq spent only 24 percent of the $27 billion it budgeted for its own reconstruction efforts. More specifically, Iraq's central ministries, responsible for security and essential services, spent only 11 percent of their capital investment budgets in 2007--down from similarly low rates of 14 and 13 percent in the 2 prior years. Violence and sectarian strife, shortage of skilled labor, and weak procurement and budgeting systems have hampered Iraq's efforts to spend its capital budgets. Although oil production has improved for short periods, the May 2008 production level of about 2.5 million barrels per day (mbpd) was below the U.S. goal of 3 mbpd. The daily supply of electricity met only about half of demand in early May 2008. Conversely, State reports that U.S. goals for Iraq's water sector are close to being reached. The unstable security environment, corruption, and lack of technical capacity have contributed to the shortfalls. The Departments disagreed with our recommendation, stating that The New Way Forward strategy remains valid but the strategy shall be reviewed and refined as necessary. We reaffirm the need for an updated strategy given the important changes that have occurred in Iraq since January 2007. An updated strategy should build on recent gains, address unmet goals and objectives and articulate the U.S. strategy beyond July 2008.", "Pursuant to a congressional request, GAO reviewed the Department of Defense's (DOD) foreign procurement data, focusing on DOD's: (1) reported trends on contracts performed outside the United States; and (2) use of foreign subcontract information and the completeness and accuracy of how DOD collects and manages its data. GAO noted that: (1) for prime contracts, DOD purchases the majority of its defense equipment and services from contractors operating in the United States; (2) though subject to annual fluctuations, DOD's prime contract awards outside the United States remained about 5.5 percent of total DOD contract awards from fiscal year (FY) 1987 to 1997; (3) over this period, the value of DOD prime contracts performed both in and out of the United States declined; (4) prime contracts performed outside the United States tended to be concentrated in certain countries such as Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom and in certain sectors such as services, fuel, and construction; (5) at the subcontract level, the value of DOD's reported foreign subcontract awards ranged from almost $2 billion in FY 1990 to almost $1.1 billion in FY 1997, but this data has its limitations; (6) the Office of Foreign Contracting does not consider the data needs of industrial base specialists in its efforts to collect foreign subcontract data; (7) industrial base specialists are often unaware that data of this nature are available; (8) furthermore, weaknesses in the Office of Foreign Contracting's data collection and management processes undermine DOD's ability to use the foreign subcontract data for defense trade and industrial base decision-making; (9) the Office has no mechanism for ensuring that contractors provide required foreign subcontract information, which contributes to the underrepresentation of foreign subcontract activity; (10) GAO's review of selected subcontracts disclosed instances in which foreign subcontracts were not reported to the Office because contractors were unaware of the reporting requirement or misunderstood the criteria for reporting a foreign subcontract; and (11) the Office's poor database management also compromises the credibility and usefulness of its foreign subcontract data.", "Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 established DOE's loan guarantee program (LGP) for innovative energy projects that should decrease air pollutants or greenhouse gases and that have a reasonable prospect of repayment. For fiscal years 2008 and 2009, Congress authorized the use of borrower fees to pay the costs of loan guarantees through Title XVII's \"borrower pays\" option, under which DOE will limit loan guarantees to $38.5 billion. Congress mandated that GAO review DOE's progress in implementing the LGP. GAO assessed DOE's progress in (1) issuing final regulations and (2) taking actions to help ensure that the program is managed effectively and to maintain accountability. GAO also assessed how inherent risks due to the nature of the LGP may affect DOE's ability to achieve intended program outcomes. GAO analyzed DOE's regulations, guidance, and program documents and files; reviewed Title XVII; and interviewed DOE officials. In October 2007, DOE issued regulations that govern the LGP and include requirements for application submissions, project evaluation factors, and lender eligibility and servicing requirements. The regulations also generally address requirements set forth in applicable guidance. Some key aspects of the initial LGP guidelines were revised in the regulations to help make the program more attractive to lenders and potentially reduce financing costs for projects. For example, the maximum loan guarantee percentage increased from 80 to 100 percent of the loan. In addition, the regulations define equity as \"cash contributed by the borrowers,\" but DOE officials told us they also plan to consider certain non-cash contributions, such as land, as equity. As a result, applicants may not fully understand the program's equity requirements. DOE is not well positioned to manage the LGP effectively and maintain accountability because it has not completed a number of key management and internal control activities. As a result, DOE may not be able to process applications efficiently and effectively, although it has begun to do so. DOE has not sufficiently determined the resources it will need or completed detailed policies, criteria, and procedures for evaluating applications, identifying eligible lenders, monitoring loans and lenders, estimating program costs, or accounting for the program--key steps that GAO recommended DOE take over a year ago. DOE also has not established key measures to use in evaluating program progress. Risks inherent to the LGP will make it difficult for DOE to estimate subsidy costs, which could lead to financial losses and may introduce biases in the projects that receive guarantees. The nature and characteristics of the LGP and uncertain future economic conditions increase the difficulty in estimating the LGP's subsidy costs. Because the LGP targets innovative technologies and the projects will have unique characteristics--varying in size, technology, and experience of the project sponsor--evaluating the risks of individual projects will be complicated and could result in misestimates. The likelihood that DOE will misestimate costs, along with the practice of charging fees to cover the estimated costs, may lead to biases in the projects that receive guarantees. Borrowers who believe DOE has underestimated costs and has consequently set fees that are less than the risks of the projects are the most likely to accept guarantees. To the extent that DOE underestimates the costs and does not collect sufficient fees from borrowers to cover the full costs, taxpayers will ultimately bear the costs of shortfalls. Even if DOE's estimates of subsidy costs are reasonably accurate, some borrowers may not pursue a guarantee because they perceive the fee to be too high relative to the benefits of the guarantee, affecting the project's financial viability. To the extent that this financial viability is not distributed evenly across the technologies targeted by Title XVII, projects in DOE's portfolio may not represent the range of technologies targeted by the program.", "The 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) provision required the Department of Defense (DOD) to close the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP). GAO was asked to address the status and potential impact of implementing this BRAC provision. This report discusses (1) key services AFIP provides to the military and civilian communities; (2) DOD's plans to terminate, relocate, or outsource services currently provided by AFIP; and (3) the potential impacts of disestablishing AFIP on military and civilian communities. New legislation requires DOD to consider this GAO report as it develops its plan for the reorganization of AFIP. GAO reviewed DOD's plans, analysis, and other relevant information, and interviewed officials from the public and private sectors. AFIP pathologists perform three key services--diagnostic consultations, education, and research--primarily for physicians from DOD, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and civilian institutions. AFIP provides consultations when physicians cannot make a diagnosis or are unsure of their initial diagnosis. About half of its 40,000 consultations in 2006 were for DOD physicians, and the rest were nearly equally divided between VA and civilian physicians. AFIP's educational services train physicians in diagnosing the most difficult-to-diagnose diseases. Civilian physicians use these services more extensively than military physicians. In addition, AFIP pathologists collaborate with others on research applicable to military operations and general medicine, often using material from AFIP's repository of tissue specimens to gain a better understanding of disease diagnosis and treatment. To implement the 2005 BRAC provision, DOD plans to terminate most services currently provided by AFIP and is developing plans to relocate or outsource others. DOD plans to outsource some diagnostic consultations to the private sector through a newly established office and use its pathologists for consultations when possible. With the exception of two courses, DOD does not plan to retain AFIP's educational program. DOD also plans to halt AFIP's research and realign the repository, which is AFIP's primary research resource. The BRAC provision allows DOD flexibility to retain services that were not specifically addressed in the provision. As a result, DOD will retain four additional AFIP services and is considering whether to retain six others. DOD had planned to begin implementation of the BRAC provision related to AFIP in July 2007 and complete action by September 2011, but statutory requirements prevent DOD from reorganizing or relocating AFIP functions until after DOD submits a detailed plan and timetable for the proposed implementation of these changes to congressional committees no later than December 31, 2007. Once the plan has been submitted, DOD can resume reorganizing and relocating AFIP. Discontinuing, relocating, or outsourcing AFIP services may have minimal impact on DOD, VA, and civilian communities because pathology services are available from alternate sources, but a smooth transition depends on DOD's actions to address the challenges in developing new approaches to obtaining pathology expertise and managing the repository. For consultations, these challenges are to determine how to use existing pathology resources, obtain outside expertise, and ensure coordination and funding of services to avoid disincentives to quality care. While DOD has begun to identify the challenges, it has not developed strategies to address them. Similarly, whether the repository will continue to be a rich resource for military and civilian research depends on how DOD populates, maintains, and provides access to it in the future, but DOD has not developed strategies to address these issues. DOD contracted for a study, due to be completed in October 2008, of the usefulness of the material in the repository. DOD plans to use this study to help make decisions about managing the repository.", "Pursuant to a congressional request, GAO discussed the safety of large commercial trucks on the nation's highways, focusing on: (1) trends in crashes involving large trucks; (2) factors that contribute to such crashes; and (3) the Federal Highway Administration's Office of Motor Carrier and Highway Safety's (OMCHS) activities to improve the safety of large trucks. GAO noted that: (1) of the nearly 42,000 people who died on the nation's highways in 1997, about 5,400 died from crashes involving large trucks; (2) this represents a 20 percent increase from 1992; (3) at the same time, the annual number of miles traveled by large trucks increased by a similar proportion; (4) if this trend of increasing truck travel continues, the number of fatalities could increase to 5,800 in 1999 and to more than 6,000 in 2000; (5) while trucks are involved in fewer crashes per mile traveled than are cars, crashes involving trucks are more likely to result in a fatality; (6) in 1997, 98 percent of the fatalities from crashes between trucks and cars were the occupants of the car; (7) although no definitive information on the causes of crashes involving large trucks exists, several factors contribute to these crashes; (8) these contributing factors include errors on the part of car and truck drivers, truck driver fatigue, and vehicle defects; (9) of these factors, errors on the part of car drivers are cited most frequently as contributing to crashes involving large trucks; (10) specifically, errors by car drivers were reported in 80 percent of the crashes, while truck drivers errors were reported in 28 percent of the crashes; (11) while many factors outside OMCHS' authority--such as the use of safety belts by car occupants and states' actions--influence the number of fatalities that result from crashes involving large trucks, the Federal Highway Administration has established a goal for 1999 of reducing these fatalities; (12) its goal is to reduce the number of fatalities to below the 1996 level of 5,126--substantially less than the projected figure of 5,800; (13) OMCHS has undertaken a number of activities intended to achieve this goal, such as identifying high-risk carriers for safety improvements and educating car drivers about how to share the road with large trucks; and (14) however, OMCHS is unlikely to reach the goal because: (a) its initiative to target high-risk carriers for safety improvements depends on data that are not complete, accurate, or timely; (b) several activities will not be completed before the end of 1999; and (c) the effectiveness of OMCHS' educational campaign to improve car drivers' behavior is unknown.", "Under the Federal Power Act, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issues licenses for up to 50 years to construct and operate nonfederal hydropower projects. These projects must be relicensed when their licenses expire to continue operating. Relevant federal resource agencies issue license conditions to protect federal lands and prescriptions to assist fish passage on these projects. Under section 241 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, parties to the licensing process may (1) request a \"trial-type hearing\" on any disputed issue of material fact related to a condition or prescription and (2) propose alternative conditions or prescriptions. In this context, GAO was asked to (1) determine the extent to which stakeholders have used section 241 provisions in relicensing and their outcomes and (2) describe stakeholders' views on section 241's impact on relicensing and conditions and prescriptions. GAO analyzed relicensing documents filed with FERC and conducted a total of 61 interviews with representatives from relevant federal resource agencies, FERC, licensees, tribal groups, industry groups, and environmental groups. Since the passage of the Energy Policy Act in 2005, nonfederal stakeholders--licensees, states, environmental groups, and an Indian tribe--used section 241 provisions for 25 of the 103 eligible hydropower projects being relicensed, most of which occurred within the first year. Of these 25 projects, stakeholders proposed a total of 211 alternative conditions and prescriptions. In response, the federal resource agencies (U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service, Department of Commerce's National Marine Fisheries Service, and several bureaus in the Department of the Interior) accepted no alternatives as originally proposed but instead modified a total of 140 and removed a total of 9 of the agencies' preliminary conditions and prescriptions and rejected 42 of the 211 alternatives; the remaining alternatives are pending as of May 17, 2010. Under section 241, resource agencies must submit a statement to FERC explaining the basis for accepting or rejecting a proposed alternative. While agencies generally provided explanations for rejecting alternative conditions and prescriptions, with few exceptions, they did not explain the reasons for not accepting alternatives when they modified conditions and prescriptions. As a result, it is difficult to determine the extent, type, or basis of changes that were made and difficult to determine if and how the proposed alternatives affected the final conditions and prescriptions issued by the agencies. As of May 17, 2010, nonfederal stakeholders requested trial-type hearings for 18 of the 25 projects in which section 241 provisions were used, and three trial-type hearings were completed. Of the remaining 15 projects, requests for hearings were withdrawn for 14 of them when licensees and agencies negotiated a settlement agreement before the administrative law judge made a ruling, and one is pending because the licensee is in negotiations to decommission the project. In the three hearings held to date, the administrative law judge ruled in favor of the agencies on most issues. According to the federal and nonfederal relicensing stakeholders GAO spoke with, the section 241 provisions have had a variety of effects on the relicensing process and on the license conditions and prescriptions. While most licensees and a few agency officials said that section 241 encourages settlement agreements between the licensee and resource agency, some agency officials said that section 241 made agreements more difficult because efforts to negotiate have moved to preparing for potential hearings. Regarding conditions and prescriptions, some stakeholders commented that under section 241, agencies put more effort into reviewing and providing support for their conditions and prescriptions, but environmental groups and some agency officials said that in their opinion, agencies issued fewer or less environmentally protective conditions and prescriptions. Many agency officials also raised concerns about increases in workload and costs as a result of section 241. For example, their estimated costs for the three hearings to date totaled approximately $3.1 million. Furthermore, many of the stakeholders offered suggestions for improving the use of section 241, including adjusting the time frame for a trial-type hearing. GAO recommends that cognizant officials who do not adopt a proposed alternative include reasons why in their statement to FERC. The resource agencies generally agreed, but commented that no explanation is required when an alternative is withdrawn as a result of negotiations.", "In a report issued in May 2006, GAO examined compliance with the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) physician credentialing and privileging requirements at seven VA medical facilities GAO visited. VA's credentialing process is used to determine whether a physician's professional credentials, such as licensure, are valid and meet VA's requirements for employment. VA's privileging process is used to determine which health care services or clinical privileges, such as surgical procedures, a VA physician is qualified to provide to veterans without supervision. Although GAO cannot generalize from its findings, GAO found that the seven facilities were complying with credentialing requirements. However, the facilities were not complying with aspects of certain privileging requirements. To better ensure that VA physicians are qualified to deliver care safely to veterans, GAO made three recommendations to improve VA's privileging of physicians. GAO was asked to testify on (1) how VA credentials and privileges physicians working in its medical facilities and (2) the extent to which VA has implemented the three recommendations made in GAO's May 2006 report that address VA's privileging requirements. To update its issued work, GAO reviewed VA's policies, procedures, and correspondence related to physician privileging and interviewed VA central office officials to determine if the recommendations made in GAO's May 2006 report were implemented. The Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) has specific requirements that medical facility officials must follow to credential and privilege physicians. VA requires its medical facility officials to credential and privilege facility physicians periodically so that they can continue to work at VA. Facility officials verify the information used in the credentialing process and query certain databases that contain information on disciplinary actions that have been taken against a physician's state medical license and have information about a physician's professional competence. Each physician also must complete a written request for clinical privileges that is reviewed by the physician's supervisor who considers whether the physician has the appropriate professional credentials, training, and work experience. In addition, every 2 years, the supervisor is to consider information on a physician's performance, such as a physician's surgical complication rate, when deciding whether to renew a physician's clinical privileges. In a May 2006, GAO examined compliance with VA's physician credentialing and privileging requirements at seven VA medical facilities it visited and made three recommendations designed to improve aspects of privileging and oversight of the process. The three recommendations were (1) to provide guidance to medical facilities on how to collect individual physician performance information in accordance with VA's credentialing and privileging policy to use in medical facilities' privileging process, (2) to enforce the requirement that medical facilities submit information on paid VA medical malpractice claims to VA within 60 days after being notified that the claim is paid, and (3) to instruct medical facilities to establish internal controls to ensure the accuracy of their privileging information. VA reports that it has implemented all three recommendations by establishing policy and guidance for its medical facilities. However, GAO does not know the extent of compliance with these requirements at VA medical facilities.", "The President's New Way Forward in Iraq identified Iraq's inability to spend its resources to rebuild infrastructure and deliver essential services as a critical economic challenge to Iraq's self-reliance. Further, Iraq's ability to spend its $10.1 billion capital projects budget in 2007 was one of the 18 benchmarks used to assess U.S. progress in stabilizing and rebuilding Iraq. This report (1) examines data the U.S. embassy used to determine the extent to which the government of Iraq spent its 2007 capital projects budget, (2) identifies factors affecting the Iraqi government's ability to spend these funds, and (3) describes U.S. government efforts to assist the Iraqi government in spending its capital projects funds. For this effort, GAO reviewed Iraqi government budget data and information on provincial spending collected by the U.S. Provincial Reconstruction Teams. GAO also interviewed officials from the departments of the Treasury, Defense, State, and other agencies and organizations. U.S. and Iraq reports show widely disparate rates for Iraqi government spending on capital projects. Accordingly, GAO cannot determine the extent to which the Iraqi government is spending its 2007 capital projects budget. In its September 2007 Iraqi benchmark assessment, the administration reported that Iraq's central government ministries had spent 24 percent of their 2007 capital projects budget, as of July 15, 2007. However, this report is not consistent with Iraq's official expenditure reports, which show that the central ministries had spent only 4.4 percent of their investment budget as of August 2007. The discrepancies between the official and unofficial data highlight uncertainties about the sources and use of Iraq's expenditure data. The government of Iraq faces many challenges that limit its ability to spend its capital project budget. Violence and sectarian strife delay capital budget execution by increasing the time and cost needed to implement contracts. Recent refugee flows and the de-Ba'athification process have contributed to the exodus of skilled labor from Iraq. In addition, U.S. and foreign officials also noted that weaknesses in Iraqi procurement, budgeting, and accounting procedures impede completion of capital projects. For example, according to the State Department, Iraq's Contracting Committee requires about a dozen signatures to approve projects exceeding $10 million, which slows the process. U.S. agencies have undertaken a variety of programs to help Iraq execute its capital projects budget, although it is not clear what impact these efforts have had to date. U.S. agencies supported new efforts in 2007 targeting Iraq's ability to spend capital budget funds, including an office to provide procurement assistance to ministries and provinces and a new position in the U.S. Embassy to coordinate with senior Iraqi government officials on budget execution and oversee related U.S. assistance efforts. In addition, improving Iraqi government budget execution is part of a broader U.S. assistance effort to improve the capacity of the Iraqi government. For example, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has trained 500 ministry officials in procurement or budget execution. USAID also led an effort to implement an automated financial management information system for the Iraqi government, although this program was suspended in June 2007 following the kidnapping of five contractors involved in the project. In addition, U.S. advisors work directly with key Iraqi ministries to assist with budget execution and procurement, among other responsibilities.", "The U.S. government owns about 3,500 properties overseas at more than 220 locations, including embassy and consular office buildings, housing, and land. The Department of State is responsible for acquiring, managing, and disposing of these properties. In 1996, GAO reported that the State Department did not have an effective process for identifying and selling unneeded overseas real estate, and that decisions concerning the sale of some properties had been delayed for years because of parochial conflicts among the parties involved. The State Department has taken steps to implement a more systematic process for identifying unneeded properties by (1) requesting posts to annually identify excess, underutilized, and obsolete property and (2) requesting its own staff and Inspector General officials to place greater emphasis on identifying such property when they visit posts. The State Department has significantly increased its sales of unneeded properties in the last 5 years. From 1997 through 2001, it sold 104 overseas properties for over $404 million, almost triple the proceeds compared with the previous 5 year period. However, the department still has a large number of unneeded properties that have not yet been sold. The State Department has not effectively implemented recommendations made by the Real Property Advisory Board to sell unneeded property. State has disposed of only 7 properties of the 26 recommended for sale by the board.", "The opportunity for employment is one of the most powerful magnets attracting illegal immigration to the United States. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 established an employment eligibility verification process, but immigration experts state that a more reliable verification system is needed. In 1996, the former U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, now within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Social Security Administration (SSA) began operating a voluntary pilot program, called the Employment Eligibility Verification (EEV) program, to provide participating employers with a means for electronically verifying employees' work eligibility. Congress is considering various immigration reform proposals, some of which would require all employers to electronically verify the work authorization status of their employees at the time of hire. In this testimony GAO provides observations on the EEV system's capacity, data reliability, ability to detect fraudulent documents and identity theft, and vulnerability to employer fraud as well as challenges to making the program mandatory for all employers. This testimony is based on our previous work regarding the employment eligibility verification process and updated information obtained from DHS and SSA. A mandatory EEV program would substantially increase the number of employers using the system. As of May 2007, about 17,000 employers have registered to use the current voluntary EEV program, about half of which are active users. If participation in EEV were made mandatory, the approximately 5.9 million employers in the United States may be required to participate. Requiring all employers to use EEV would substantially increase the demands on DHS and SSA resources. DHS estimated that increasing the capacity of EEV could cost it $70 million annually for program management and $300 million to $400 million annually for compliance activities and staff. SSA officials estimated that expansion of the EEV program through this fiscal year would cost $5 million to $6 million and noted that the cost of mandatory EEV would be much higher and driven by increased workload of its field office staff that would be responsible for resolving queries that SSA cannot immediately confirm. DHS and SSA are exploring options to reduce delays in the EEV process. The majority of EEV queries entered by employers--about 92 percent--confirm within seconds that the employee is work authorized. About 7 percent of the queries cannot be immediately confirmed by SSA, and about 1 percent cannot be immediately confirmed by DHS. Resolving these nonconfirmations can take several days, or in a few cases even weeks. DHS and SSA are considering options for improving the system's ability to perform additional automated checks to immediately confirm work authorization, which may be important should EEV be mandatory. EEV may help reduce document fraud, but it cannot yet fully address identity fraud issues, for example, when employees present borrowed or stolen genuine documents. The current EEV program is piloting a photograph screening tool, whereby an employer can more easily identify fraudulent documentation. DHS expects to expand the use of this tool to all participating employers by September 2007. Although mandatory EEV and the associated use of the photograph screening tool offer some remedy, limiting the number of acceptable work authorization documents and making them more secure would help to more fully address identity fraud. The EEV program is vulnerable to employer fraud, such as entering the same identity information to authorize multiple workers. EEV is also vulnerable to employer misuse that adversely affects employees, such as employers limiting work assignments or pay while employees are undergoing the verification process. DHS is establishing a new Compliance and Monitoring program to help reduce employer fraud and misuse by, for example, identifying patterns in employer compliance with program requirements. Information suggesting employers' fraud or misuse of the system could be useful to other DHS components in targeting limited worksite enforcement resources and promoting employer compliance with employment laws.", "The high-cost program within the Universal Service Fund (USF) provides subsidies to telecommunications carriers that serve rural and other remote areas with high costs of providing telephone service. The annual program cost has grown from $2.6 billion in 2001 to over $4 billion in 2011, primarily funded through fees added to consumers\u0092 phone bills. The program is managed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which noted that providing universal access to broadband is \u0093the universal service challenge of our time.\u0094 Accordingly, FCC made changes to the program to make funds available to support both telephone and broadband. GAO previously reported that using USF monies for broadband could cause the size of the fund to greatly expand unless FCC improved its management and oversight to ensure the program\u0092s cost-effectiveness. This requested report examines FCC\u0092s (1) plans for repurposing the high-cost program for broadband, and (2) plans to address previously identified management challenges as it broadens the program\u0092s scope. GAO reviewed and analyzed pertinent FCC orders, associated stakeholder comments, and reports related to USF and interviewed federal and industry stakeholders, as well as economists and experts. Under the USF Transformation Order, FCC adopted new rules to fundamentally change the high-cost program by extending the program to support broadband capable networks. For example, FCC established a $4.5-billion annual program budget for the next 6 years, created new funds\u0097called the Connect America Fund and the Mobility Fund\u0097that will support broadband deployment, and established public interest obligations for the carriers as a condition of receiving funds. Specifically, FCC will require carriers to offer broadband services in their supported service areas, meet certain broadband performance requirements, and report regularly on associated broadband performance measures. FCC also changed its method for distributing funds to carriers to address some of the recognized inefficiencies with the program. According to FCC, these changes will allow it to reduce high-cost support for carriers providing only voice services and make funds available to carriers to offer both voice and broadband services. FCC has taken several steps to address previously identified oversight and management challenges that GAO and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) have raised in the last 7 years, but issues remain. Management challenges identified by GAO included a lack of performance goals and measures for the program and weak internal controls, while OMB criticized FCC\u0092s inability to base funding decisions on measurable benefits. In response, FCC established performance goals and measures for the high-cost program and improved internal control mechanisms over the fund. While these are noteworthy actions, GAO identified gaps in FCC\u0092s plans to better oversee the program and make it more effective and efficient. In particular, FCC has not addressed its inability to determine the effect of the fund and lacks a specific data-analysis plan for carrier data it will collect. Such analysis would enable FCC to adjust the size of the Connect America Fund based on data-driven evaluation and would allow Congress and FCC to make better informed decisions about the program\u0092s future and how program efficiency could be improved. GAO also found that FCC lacks a mechanism to link carrier rates and revenues with support payments. A requirement in statute is for rates for telecommunications services to be reasonably comparable in rural and urban areas, but FCC has noted that some rural carriers are offering basic local rates for telephone services that are lower than the average basic rate paid by urban consumers. FCC has stated that it is not equitable for all consumers to subsidize the cost of service for some consumers who pay local service rates that are significantly lower than the national average and has therefore instituted an incentive mechanism for carriers to increase artificially low consumer rates. Although FCC would like to prevent consumers from subsidizing carriers that offer service at artificially low rates, its incentive mechanism to raise rural rates will not reduce the financial burden placed on all consumers as there is currently no connection between the support payments a carrier receives and the carrier\u0092s rates and revenues. The Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service recommended that FCC consider a carrier\u0092s revenues when calculating its need for support payments, but in the past, FCC declined to implement this recommendation. FCC is developing a new model to calculate carrier support, but has not stated what factors will be included. FCC should (1) establish a specific data-analysis plan for carrier data to determine program effectiveness, and (2) consult with the Joint Board as it examines the factors for calculating carrier support payments. FCC concurred with the recommendations and provided technical comments.", "The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) mission is to promote the safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of air traffic in the United States airspace system, commonly referred to as the National Airspace System (NAS). To maintain its ability to effectively carry out this mission FAA embarked, in 1981,on a multi-billion dollar effort to modernize its aging air traffic control (ATC) system, the principle technology component of the NAS. Yet the NAS modernization has continued to be plagued by cost increases, schedule delays, and performance shortfalls. To gain insight into how FAA is meeting its management challenges, congressional requesters asked GAO to evaluate FAA's processes for making IT investment management decisions. The objectives of this review included (1) evaluating FAA's capabilities for managing its IT investments and (2) determining what plans, if any, the agency might have for improving these capabilities. Judged against the criteria of GAO's framework for information technology investment management (ITIM), which measures the maturity of an organization's investment management processes, FAA has established about 80 percent of the basic selection and control practices that it needs to manage its mission-critical investments. For example, business lines actively monitor projects throughout their life cycles. However, the agency's senior IT investment board does not regularly review investments that are in the \"in-service management,\" or operational, phase of their life cycles, and this creates a weakness in FAA's ability to oversee more than $1 billion of its IT investments. In addition, the agency has not yet established the key practices that would allow it to manage all of its investments as one portfolio--an integrated set of competing options. Until FAA has established the practices that would enable it to effectively manage its annual IT budget of about $2.5 billion, agency executives lack assurance that they are selecting and managing the mix of investments that best meets the agency's needs and priorities. The agency has initiated efforts to improve its investment management processes, but it has not yet developed and implemented a comprehensive plan--supported by management--to guide all of its improvement efforts. Such a plan is crucial in helping FAA to coordinate and prioritize its improvement efforts and sustain its commitment to the efforts it already has under way. Without such a plan--and controls for implementing it--FAA will be unlikely to develop a mature investment management capability.", "On April 20, 2010, an explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig leased by BP America Production Company (BP) resulted in a significant oil spill. GAO was requested to (1) identify the financial risks to the federal government resulting from oil spills, particularly Deepwater Horizon, (2) assess the Coast Guard's internal controls for ensuring that processes and payments for spill-related cost reimbursements and claims related to the spill are appropriate, and (3) describe the extent to which the federal government oversees the BP and Gulf Coast Claims Facility cost reimbursement and claims processes. We issued status reports in November 2010 and April 2011. This is the third and final report related to these objectives. We obtained and analyzed data on costs incurred from April 2010 through May 2011 and claims submitted and processed from September 2010 through May 2011. We reviewed relevant policies and procedures, interviewed officials and staff at key federal departments and agencies, and tested a sample of claims processed and cost reimbursements paid for compliance with internal controls.. Both the individual circumstances of the Deepwater Horizon incident, as well as the overall framework for how the federal government responds to oil spills, present a mix of evolving, but as yet uncertain, financial risks to the federal government and its Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (Fund). The extent of financial risks to the federal government from the Deepwater Horizon is closely tied to BP and the other responsible parties. BP established a $20 billion Trust to pay for individual and business claims and other expenses. As of May 31, 2011, BP has paid over $700 million of federal and state government costs for oil spill cleanup. Federal agency cleanup and restoration activities are under way and agencies continue to incur costs and submit them for reimbursement. However, the full extent of these costs, particularly those related to environmental cleanup, may not be fully realized for some time. As cleanup costs continue to mount, it is possible that expenditures from the Fund will reach the $1 billion total expenditure per incident cap. Expenditures were over $626 million on May 31, 2011. If these amounts reach the total expenditure cap of $1 billion, the Fund can no longer be used to make payments to reimburse agencies' costs (or to pay valid individual or business claims if not paid by the responsible parties). At that point, government agencies would no longer be able to obtain reimbursement for their costs. In November 2010, GAO suggested that Congress may want to consider setting a Fund per incident cap based on net expenditures (expenditures less reimbursement), rather than total expenditures. Finally, GAO found the federal government's longer-term ability to provide financial support in response to future oil spills is also at risk because the Fund's primary source of revenue, a tax on petroleum products, is scheduled to expire in 2017. GAO's testing of the Coast Guard's internal controls over Deepwater Horizon claims processed and cost reimbursements processed and paid showed that adjudicated claims processed and costs reimbursed were appropriate and properly documented. In November 2010, GAO made four recommendations regarding establishing and maintaining effective cost reimbursement policies and procedures for the Fund. The Coast Guard changed its operating practices to reflect lessons learned from the initial response to the Deepwater Horizon incident, and it has updated its cost reimbursement procedures accordingly. However, the Coast Guard has not yet updated its procedures for processing significant claims, so lessons learned from its experiences processing Deepwater Horizon claims could be lost. The federal government has used a variety of approaches to oversee BP's and GCCF's cost reimbursement and claims processing. Soon after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the federal government established a Deepwater Integrated Services Team (IST), which was initially responsible for monitoring BP's claims process, among other things. Subsequently, the oversight of cost reimbursement and claims activities transitioned to the Department of Justice, which continues to lead this and other efforts. In addition, the Department of the Interior and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are serving as the federal government's representatives for the natural resource trustees in evaluating the environmental impact of the Deepwater Horizon spill and selecting and implementing restoration projects to be funded by BP. GAO is (1) reiterating that Congress may want to consider setting a Fund cap per incident based upon net expenditures, (2) presenting a new matter concerning extending the barrel tax used to finance federal oil spill responses to sustain program funding, and (3) making a recommendation to improve procedures for future significant spills. In responding, the Department of Homeland Security concurred with the recommendation.", "The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) program stores and processes biometric and biographic information to, among other things, control and monitor the entry and exit of foreign visitors. Currently, an entry capability is operating at almost 300 U.S. ports of entry, but an exit capability is not. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has previously reported on limitations in DHS's efforts to plan and execute its efforts to deliver US-VISIT exit, and made recommendations to improve these areas. GAO was asked to determine (1) the status of DHS's efforts to deliver a comprehensive exit solution and (2) to what extent DHS is applying an integrated approach to managing its comprehensive exit solution. To accomplish this, GAO assessed US-VISIT exit project plans, schedules, and other management documentation against relevant criteria, and it observed exit pilots. DHS has established a Comprehensive Exit project within its US-VISIT program that consists of six components that are at varying stages of completion. To DHS's credit, the US-VISIT program office has established integrated project management plans for, and has adopted an integrated approach to, interacting with and involving stakeholders in its Comprehensive Exit project. However, it has not adopted an integrated approach to scheduling, executing, and tracking the work that needs to be accomplished to deliver a comprehensive exit solution. Rather, it is relying on several separate and distinct schedules to manage individual components and the US-VISIT prime contractor's work that supports these components. Moreover, neither of the two component schedules that GAO reviewed are reliable because they have not been derived in accordance with relevant guidance. Specifically, both the Air Exit Pilots schedule and the Temporary Worker Visa Exit Pilot schedule only fully meet one of nine key schedule estimating practices, and either partially, minimally, or do not meet the remaining eight. In contrast, the prime contractor's schedule is largely reliable, as it fully or substantially meets all nine practices. Without a master schedule for the Comprehensive Exit project that is integrated and derived in accordance with relevant guidance, DHS cannot reliably commit to when and how the work will be accomplished to deliver a comprehensive exit solution to its almost 300 ports of entry, and it cannot adequately monitor and manage its progress toward this end.", "Pursuant to a congressional request, GAO discussed foodborne pathogens and their impact on public health. GAO noted that: (1) millions of illnesses and thousands of deaths result annually from contaminated foods; (2) the actual incidence of foodborne illnesses is unknown because most cases go unreported; (3) public health officials believe that the risk of foodborne illnesses has increased over the last 20 years because of food production changes, broader distribution, food mishandling, demographic changes, and new and more resistant bacteria; (4) the Department of Agriculture estimates that the costs of foodborne illnesses range from $5.6 billion to over $22 billion per year; (5) foodborne illnesses can also cause long-term disabilities, such as reactive arthritis and paralysis; (6) states are not required to report all foodborne illnesses or their causes; (7) more uniform and comprehensive data on the number and causes of foodborne illnesses could lead to the development of more effective control strategies, but federal officials are not sure they can continue to fund such data collection efforts if budget cuts continue; (8) federal agencies often do not address emerging food safety concerns because there are different rules for foods posing the same risks and limited inspection resources; and (9) unsuccessful coordination of food safety activities results from agencies' fragmented responsibilities.", "The federal government extended unprecedented support to financial institutions to stabilize financial markets during the financial crisis. While these actions helped to avert a more severe crisis, they raised questions about the appropriate scope of government safety nets for financial institutions. GAO was asked to review the benefits that large bank holding companies (those with more than $500 billion in assets) have received from actual and implied government support. This is the first of two reports GAO will issue on this topic. This report examines (1) actual government support for banks and bank holding companies during the financial crisis, and (2) recent statutory and regulatory changes related to government support for banks and bank holding companies. GAO reviewed relevant statutes, regulations, and agency documents; analyzed program transaction data; and interviewed regulators, representatives of financial institutions, and academics. In a second report to be issued in 2014, GAO will examine any funding or other economic advantages the largest bank holding companies have received as a result of implied government support. During the 2007-09 financial crisis, the federal government's actions to stabilize the financial system provided funding support and other benefits to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. Agencies introduced new programs with broad-based eligibility that provided funding support to eligible institutions, which included entities that were part of a bank holding company and others. Programs that provided the most significant support directly to bank holding companies or their subsidiaries included Department of the Treasury capital investment programs, Federal Reserve System lending programs, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) guarantee programs. Together these actions helped to stabilize financial conditions, while participating firms also accrued benefits specific to their own institutions, such as liquidity benefits from programs that allowed them to borrow at longer maturities and at interest rates that were below possible market alternatives. At the end of 2008, program use--measured for each institution as the percentage of total assets supported by the programs--was higher on average for banks and bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in total assets than for smaller firms. The six largest bank holding companies were significant participants in several emergency programs but exited most by the end of 2009. Differences in program use were driven in part by how institutions funded themselves. For example, while smaller banks relied more on deposit funding, larger bank holding companies relied more on short-term funding markets and participated more in programs that assisted these markets. In addition to these programs, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board) granted several regulatory exemptions to allow banks to provide liquidity support to their nonbank affiliates and for other purposes. Finally, government assistance to individual troubled firms benefited these firms, their counterparties, and the financial system. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) contains provisions that aim to modify the scope of federal safety nets, restrict future government support and strengthen regulatory oversight for the banking sector, but implementation is incomplete and the effectiveness of some provisions remains uncertain. Agencies have finalized certain changes to traditional safety nets for insured banks, but impacts of provisions to limit the scope of transactions that benefit from these safety nets will depend on how they are implemented. The act also places restrictions on emergency authorities used by regulators during the crisis to assist financial firms. For example, it prohibits the use of these authorities to rescue a specific failing firm. The Federal Reserve Board is required by the act to establish policies and procedures implementing changes to its emergency authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, but it has not completed its process for drafting the required procedures or set time frames for doing so. Setting time frames could help ensure more timely completion of these procedures. FDIC has made progress toward implementing its new authority under the Dodd-Frank Act to resolve a large failing firm. FDIC continues to work to address potential obstacles to the viability of its resolution process as an alternative to bankruptcy, such as challenges that could arise when resolving more than one failing firm. Finally, the Federal Reserve Board has finalized certain enhanced prudential standards for the largest financial firms intended to reduce the risks these firms could pose to the financial system. GAO recommends that the Federal Reserve Board establish timeframes for completing its process for drafting procedures related to its emergency lending authority to ensure timely compliance with Dodd-Frank Act requirements. The Federal Reserve Board accepted this recommendation.", "More wood is consumed every year in the United States than all metals, plastics, and masonry cement combined. To maximize their use of wood, forest product companies rely on research into new methods for using wood. At least 12 federal agencies have provided support to wood utilization research and product development activities, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service and Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES)-funded wood utilization research centers, which historically have specifically targeted support to these activities. GAO was asked to identify (1) the types of wood utilization research and product development activities federal agencies support and how these activities are coordinated; (2) the level of support federal agencies made available for these activities in fiscal years 2004 and 2005, and changes in the level of support at the Forest Service and at the CSREES-funded wood utilization research centers for fiscal years 1995 through 2005; and (3) how the federal government transfers the technologies and products from its wood utilization research and product development activities to industry. GAO provided a draft of this report to the 12 federal agencies for review and comment. Some of the agencies provided technical comments, which were incorporated as appropriate. Federal wood utilization research and product development span a broad spectrum of activities. These activities fall into five categories: harvesting, wood properties, manufacturing and processing, products and testing, and economics and marketing. Of the 12 federal agencies that provided support to wood utilization research and product development, only the Forest Service and the CSREES-funded wood utilization centers had activities in all five categories; although all the agencies had activities in manufacturing and processing. Coordination of these activities is both informal and formal. Scientists informally coordinate their activities by conferring with each other and sharing information at conferences and professional meetings and through publications. In some cases, coordination occurs through more formal mechanisms, such as cooperative arrangements and other joint ventures. During fiscal years 2004 and 2005, the 12 federal agencies made available at least $54 million annually for wood utilization research and product development activities, measured either in budget authority or expenditures. (Dollars are reported in either budget authority or expenditure data, depending on the availability of agency data.) The Forest Service made available about half of these funds. In addition, the Forest Service--the only agency that directly employs scientists and support staff to conduct wood utilization research and product development--reported having almost 175 full-time equivalent scientists and support staff in each of these years. For fiscal years 1995 through 2005, the Forest Service's budget authority for wood utilization research and product development activities fluctuated moderately from year-to-year (in inflationadjusted dollars). In contrast, overall, CSREES' budget authority for the wood utilization research centers increased over the period (in inflation-adjusted dollars), in part because of the addition of four new wood utilization research centers between fiscal years 1999 and 2004. To transfer technologies and products to industry, federal agencies generally rely on scientists and technology transfer specialists, who use methods such as information sharing, technical assistance, and demonstration projects. For example, applying research from the Forest Products Laboratory, Forest Service technology transfer specialists assisted a small forest products company in producing flooring from small trees by, among other things, providing solutions to product imperfections like warping and discoloration.", "Congress authorized the creation of risk retention groups (RRG) to increase the availability and affordability of commercial liability insurance. An RRG is a group of similar businesses that creates its own insurance company to self-insure its risks. Through the Liability Risk Retention Act (LRRA), Congress partly preempted state insurance law to create a single-state regulatory framework for RRGs, although RRGs are multistate insurers. Recent shortages of affordable liability insurance have increased RRG formations, but recent failures of several large RRGs also raised questions about the adequacy of RRG regulation. This report (1) examines the effect of RRGs on insurance availability and affordability; (2) assesses whether LRRA's preemption has resulted in significant regulatory problems; and (3) evaluates the sufficiency of LRRA's ownership, control, and governance provisions in protecting the best interests of the RRG insureds. RRGs have had a small but important effect in increasing the availability and affordability of commercial liability insurance for certain groups. While RRGs have accounted for about $1.8 billion or about 1.17 percent of all commercial liability insurance in 2003, members have benefited from consistent prices, targeted coverage, and programs designed to reduce risk. A recent shortage of affordable liability insurance prompted the creation of many new RRGs. More RRGs formed in 2002-2004 than in the previous 15 years--and about three-quarters of the new RRGs offered medical malpractice coverage. LRRA's partial preemption of state insurance laws has resulted in a regulatory environment characterized by widely varying state standards. In part, state requirements differ because some states charter RRGs as \"captive\" insurance companies, which operate under fewer restrictions than traditional insurers. As a result, most RRGs have domiciled in six states that offer captive charters (including some states that have limited experience in regulating RRGs) rather than in the states where they conduct most of their business. Additionally, because most RRGs (as captives) are not subject to the same uniform, baseline standards for solvency regulation as traditional insurers, state requirements in important areas such as financial reporting also vary. For example, some regulators may have difficulty assessing the financial condition of RRGs operating in their state because not all RRGs use the same accounting principles. Further, some evidence exists to support regulator assertions that domiciliary states may be relaxing chartering or other requirements to attract RRGs. Because LRRA does not specify characteristics of ownership and control, or establish governance safeguards, RRGs can be operated in ways that do not consistently protect the best interests of their insureds. For example, LRRA does not explicitly require that the insureds contribute capital to the RRG or recognize that outside firms typically manage RRGs. Thus, some regulators believe that members without \"skin in the game\" will have less interest in the success and operation of their RRG and that RRGs would be chartered for purposes other than self-insurance, such as making profits for entrepreneurs who form and finance an RRG. LRRA also provides no governance protections to counteract potential conflicts of interest between insureds and management companies. In fact, factors contributing to many RRG failures suggest that sometimes management companies have promoted their own interests at the expense of the insureds. The combination of single-state regulation, growth in new domiciles, and wide variance in regulatory practices has increased the potential that RRGs would face greater solvency risks. As a result, GAO believes RRGs would benefit from uniform, baseline regulatory standards. Also, because many RRGs are run by management companies, they could benefit from corporate governance standards that would establish the insureds' authority over management.", "GAO discussed the preliminary results of its work on the decisionmaking process used by the Forest Service in carrying out its mission, focusing on the underlying causes of inefficiencies and ineffectiveness in the Forest Service's decisionmaking process. GAO noted that: (1) its ongoing work has identified three underlying causes of inefficiency and ineffectiveness in the Forest Service's decisionmaking process; (2) first, the agency has not given adequate attention to improving its decisionmaking process, including improving its accountability for expenditures and performance; (3) as a result, long-standing deficiencies within its decisionmaking process that have contributed to increased costs and time and/or the inability to achieve planned objectives have not been corrected; (4) second, issues that transcend the agency's administrative boundaries and jurisdiction have not been adequately addressed; (5) in particular, the Forest Service and other federal agencies have had difficulty reconciling the administrative boundaries of national forests, parks, and other federal land management units with the boundaries of natural systems, such as watersheds and vegetative and animal communities, both in planning and in assessing the cumulative impact of federal and nonfederal activities on the environment; (6) third, the requirements of numerous planning and environmental laws, enacted during the 1960s and 1970s, have not been harmonized; (7) as a result, differences among the requirements of different laws and their differing judicial interpretations require some issues to be analyzed or reanalyzed at different stages in the different decisionmaking processes of the Forest Service and other federal agencies without any clear sequence leading to their timely resolution; (8) additional differences among the statutory requirements for protecting resources, such as endangered and threatened species, water, air, diverse plant and animal communities, and wilderness, have also sometimes been difficult to reconcile; (9) however, on the basis of its work to date, GAO believes that statutory changes to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Forest Service's decisionmaking process cannot be identified until agreement is first reached on which uses the agency is to emphasize under its broad multiple-use and sustained-yield mandate and how it is to resolve conflicts or make choices among competing uses on its lands; and (10) disagreement over which uses should receive priority, both inside and outside the agency, has also inhibited the Forest Service in establishing the goals and performance measures needed to ensure its accountability.", "Reports by the public of suspected underreporting of taxes or other tax violations can help IRS detect millions of dollars in taxes that would otherwise go uncollected. Productive referrals can help address the net $385 billion tax gap\u2014the difference between the amount of taxes paid voluntarily on time and the amount owed. IRS received about 87,000 information referrals in fiscal year 2015. GAO was asked to assess the overall effectiveness of the information referral process. This report (1) describes IRS's process for screening and routing information referrals; (2) assesses the controls for the information referral screening and routing process; and (3) evaluates the coordination between the information referral process, the Whistleblower Office, and other IRS referral programs. GAO reviewed IRS guidance, processes, and controls for the information referral process, assessed whether IRS's processes followed Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government , and interviewed IRS officials. Information referrals from the public alleging tax noncompliance must be submitted on paper forms by mail to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). These referrals are manually screened by clerical staff and routed by mail to units across IRS for further action, as shown in the figure. Ineffective internal controls undercut IRS management of the information referral process. IRS does not have an organizational structure for information referrals with clear leadership for defining objectives and outcomes for measuring cost-effectiveness and results. Without clear leadership, IRS does not know how effectively it is leveraging information referrals to address the tax gap. IRS has incomplete documentation of procedures for the information referral process, increasing the risk of delays and added costs in routing the information for further action. Although one-quarter of the information referrals in fiscal year 2015 were sent for destruction after screening, IRS has not documented procedures for supervisory review of those referrals prior to destruction. Without procedures to address these control deficiencies, IRS is compromised in its ability to know how effectively it is leveraging tax noncompliance information reported by the public. Fragmentation and overlap across IRS's general information referral process and eight specialized referral programs, such as for reporting identity theft and misconduct by return preparers, can confuse the public trying to report tax noncompliance to IRS. Yet coordination between referral programs is limited, and IRS does not have a mechanism for sharing information on crosscutting issues and collaborating to improve the efficiency of operations across the mix of referral programs. As a result, IRS may be missing opportunities to leverage resources and reduce the burden on the public trying to report possible noncompliance. GAO recommends, among other things, that IRS establish an organizational structure that identifies responsibility for defining objectives and for measuring results for information referrals; document procedures for the information referral process; and establish a coordination mechanism across IRS referral programs. IRS agreed with GAO's recommendations.", "Pursuant to a congressional request, GAO reported on the Immigration and Naturalization Service's (INS) review of its case files of aliens who were naturalized between August 31, 1995 and September 30, 1996, and who the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had identified as having criminal history records, focusing on the: (1) results of the INS and Executive Office for Immigration Review's (EOIR) case reviews; and (2) approach used by KPMG Peat Marwick LLP to monitor INS' efforts to identify improperly naturalized aliens. GAO noted that: (1) after receiving criminal history records from the FBI, INS reviewed to case files of 16,858 aliens with records that included a felony arrest or conviction of a serious crime who were naturalized between August 31, 1995, and September 30, 1996; (2) INS reviewed these criminal history records and its case files in an attempt to judge if these aliens should have been naturalized; (3) in its review of these 16,858 case files, INS designated each case as either proper, requires further action, or presumptively ineligible; (4) INS designated 10,535 cases as proper, 5,954 cases as requires further action, and 369 cases as presumptively ineligible; (5) to provide quality assurance that INS' decisions during the review were unbiased, EOIR reviewed a statistically valid sample of 557 alien cases from the universe of 16,858 aliens; (6) EOIR and INS reached the same decisions in 439 (or 79 percent) of the 557 cases; (7) although there was a 21-percent disagreement rate between the INS and EOIR reviewers, GAO could not conclude that a statistically significant difference existed between the INS and EOIR decisions; (8) INS is reviewing for potential revocation the 6,323 cases that its adjudicators judged as requiring further action or presumptively ineligible; (9) although INS initially did not plan to review the 72 cases that EOIR's review indicated may also have involved improper naturalization decisions, an attorney involved in reviewing the 6,323 cases said that these 72 cases are being reviewed with the other cases; (10) in carrying out its monitoring responsibilities, KPMG used accepted social science standards; (11) the KPMG report: (a) established procedures to ensure the appropriate collection and review of FBI criminal history records and the review of related alien case files; (b) promoted consistency in the judgments of INS adjudicators by providing training and having the adjudicators use a standardized worksheet, and (c) identified recurring adjudicator errors so that corrective action could be taken; and (12) KPMG's report also: (a) disclosed limitations in the study procedures followed; and (b) discussed conditions that may have affected the accuracy and completeness of INS' review.", "GAO discussed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), focusing on its: (1) policy on the use of force; (2) licensing of firearms dealers; and (3) compliance with legislative restrictions on maintaining certain firearms licensee data. GAO noted that: (1) between fiscal year (FY) 1990 and FY 1995, ATF arrested an annual average of 8,000 suspects and had fewer than 10 reported shootings or alleged incidents of excessive force; (2) ATF deadly force and training policies are consistent with Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) policies; (3) when serving high-risk warrants, ATF, DEA, and FBI use dynamic entry, a tactic that may involve forced entry and is used to gain rapid entry to premises; (4) in none of the FY 1995 ATF Special Response Team deployments did agents fire their weapons and in about half, agents used dynamic entries; (5) ATF procedures for reporting, investigating, and reviewing shootings and alleged excessive force cases are consistent with DEA and FBI procedures; (6) ATF complied with its reporting, investigating, and reviewing procedures, determined that all ATF shootings were justified, determined that most excessive force allegations were unsubstantiated, and punished agents determined to have engaged in misconduct; (7) between 1993 and 1995, the number of licensed firearms dealers declined by about 35 percent due to increased ATF law enforcement and new licensing laws; and (8) the ATF firearms licensee data system complies with legislative restrictions.", "In 2008, GAO reported that, with the exception of the period following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, refinery outages in the United States did not show discernible trends in reduced production capacity, frequency, and location from 2002 through 2007. Some outages are planned to perform routine maintenance or upgrades, while unplanned outages occur as a result of equipment failure or other unforeseen problems. GAO was asked to (1) evaluate the effect of refinery outages on wholesale gasoline prices and (2) identify gaps in federal data needed for this and similar analyses. GAO selected refinery outages from 2002 through September 2008 that were at least among the largest 60 percent in terms of lost production capacity in their market region and lasted at least 3 days. GAO developed an econometric model and tested a variety of assumptions using public and private data. While some unplanned refinery outages, such as those caused by accidents or weather, have had large price effects, GAO found that in general, refinery outages were associated with small increases in gasoline prices. Large price increases occurred when there were large outages; for example, in the aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita. However, we found that such large price increases were rare, and on average, outages were associated with small price increases. For example, GAO found that planned outages generally did not influence prices significantly--likely reflecting refiners' build-up in inventories to meet demand needs prior to shutting down--while for unplanned outages, average price effects ranged from less than one cent to several cents-per-gallon. Key factors influenced the size of price increases associated with unplanned outages. One such factor was whether the gasoline was branded--gasoline sold at retail under a specific refiner's trademark--or unbranded--gasoline sold at retail by independent sellers. Our analysis showed that during an unplanned outage, branded wholesale gasoline prices had smaller price increases than unbranded, suggesting that refiners give preference to their own branded customers during outages, while unbranded dealers must seek out supplies in a more constrained market. Another factor that affected the size of price increases associated with outages was the type of gasoline being sold. Some special blends of gasoline developed to reduce emissions of air pollutants exhibited larger average price increases than more widely used and available conventional gasoline, suggesting that these special gasoline blends may have more constrained supply options in the event of an outage. Existing federal data contain gaps that have limited GAO's and Department of Transportation's (DOT) analyses of petroleum markets and related issues. For example: (1) Data linking refiners to the markets they serve were inadequate for GAO to fully evaluate the price effects of unplanned outages on individual cities, limiting the analysis to broader average effects. (2) Pipeline flow and petroleum product storage data were inadequate for DOT to fully address a January 2009 Congressionally mandated study to identify potential pipeline infrastructure constraints, and limited GAO's ability to identify re-supply options for cities experiencing outage disruptions. Federal agencies generally have continued to update their data collection surveys to meet their respective needs and emerging changes in the energy sector. However, in some cases the individual agency efforts have resulted in the collection of information that does not necessarily meet the data needs of other agencies or analysts who monitor petroleum product markets.", "The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) invests hundreds of millions of dollars each year in information technology (IT) to help (1) prevent aliens from entering the United States illegally and remove aliens who succeed in doing so and (2) provide services or benefits to facilitate entry, residence, employment, and naturalization to legal immigrants. The Clinger-Cohen Act requires agency heads to implement a process for maximizing the value and assessing and managing the risks of its IT investments. GAO examined leading private and public sector IT management practices to determine whether INS is effectively managing its IT investments and whether the Department of Justice (DOJ) is effectively promoting, guiding, and overseeing INS' investment management activities. GAO found that INS lacks the basic capabilities upon which to build IT investment management maturity. Furthermore, INS is not managing IT investments as a complete portfolio. By managing its IT investments as individual projects, INS will not be able to determine which investments contribute most to the agency mission. GAO also found that DOJ is not guiding and overseeing INS' investment management approach.", "Ex-Im serves as the official export credit agency of the United States, providing a range of financial products to support the export of U.S. goods and services. Following the 2007-2009 financial crisis, increased demand for Ex-Im support resulted in significant increases in Ex-Im's outstanding financial commitments and risk exposure, which heightened interest in ensuring that Ex-Im has procedures in place to minimize financial risks. GAO was mandated by the Export-Import Bank Reauthorization Act of 2012 to review the extent to which Ex-Im (1) adequately designed and implemented procedures to reasonably assure compliance with its underwriting process requirements for loan guarantee transactions and consistency with federal guidance and (2) adequately designed procedures to prevent, detect, and investigate fraudulent applications for loan guarantees. To address these objectives, GAO (1) reviewed Ex-Im's relevant procedures and federal guidance; (2) conducted tests on statistically random samples of loan guarantees authorized between October 1, 2011, and March 31, 2013; and (3) interviewed Ex-Im officials. The Export-Import Bank's (Ex-Im) Loan, Guarantee, and Insurance Manual (Manual) describes Ex-Im's underwriting procedures and generally provides loan officers with a framework to implement its underwriting process requirements for loan guarantee transactions. GAO's review of a statistical sample of loan guarantees indicated that Ex-Im implemented many key aspects of the underwriting process as required by the Manual. However, the Manual did not (1) include certain procedures or sufficiently detailed instructions to verify compliance with Ex-Im's requirements and consistency with federal guidance, such as a procedure to verify that loan guarantee transaction applicants did not have delinquent federal debt; (2) include instructions for loan officers to use credit reports and for the inclusion of all required documents and analyses in the loan file prior to approval; and (3) call for assessments of collateral, as required by federal guidance, for certain loan guarantee transactions prior to approval. Further, Ex-Im did not have mechanisms to verify compliance with certain established procedures, including documenting certain loan guarantee eligibility procedures. In addition, Ex-Im's current risk-based approach for scheduling examinations to monitor lenders with delegated authority to approve guaranteed loans was not documented. Improvements in these areas help enhance the assessment of transaction participant eligibility and the reasonable assurance of repayment, as well as help prevent fraud. While Ex-Im has processes to prevent, detect, and investigate fraud, Ex-Im has not documented its overall processes for doing so. Such documentation is recommended by several authoritative auditing and antifraud organizations as a key step in evaluating and updating these processes. The processes Ex-Im used to prevent and detect fraud were part of its underwriting and monitoring of loan guarantees. A number of divisions within Ex-Im, as well as lenders, played a role in preventing fraudulent applications from being approved and monitoring activity that could help detect potential fraud. If a guaranteed loan defaults and an indicator of fraud existed, staff would work with Ex-Im's Office of Inspector General to leverage its investigative resources to pursue involved parties. GAO is making a number of recommendations to Ex-Im to enhance its loan guarantee underwriting process with additional procedures for ensuring compliance with Ex-Im and federal requirements, as well as for documenting fraud processes. In commenting on GAO's draft report, Ex-Im concurred with GAO's recommendations.", "The Long-Term Care Security Act required the federal government to offer long-term care insurance to its employees, their families, and others. The act also required GAO to conduct a study of the competitiveness of the Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program, which began in 2002, compared with individual and group products generally available in the private market. GAO compared the federal program's benefits, premiums, enrollment rates, and enrollee characteristics with other products over a 3-year period. GAO also compared the federal program's early claims experience with initial expectations. Program offered benefits similar to those of other long-term care insurance products GAO reviewed. Most enrollees in the federal program and in individual and group products chose similar benefit amounts, elimination or waiting periods, and benefit periods. The federal program usually offered lower premiums than individual products for comparable benefits. Overall, annual premiums for the federal program averaged across three benefit plan designs were 46 percent lower for single people and 19 percent lower for married couples who were both the same age in comparison with similar individual products sold on March 31, 2005. The participation rate in the Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program for active federal civilian employees--5 percent--was comparable to the industry average in the group market, although enrollment in the federal program was lower than initially expected. The average age of all enrollees in the federal program was younger than the average age of enrollees in individual products and older than the average age of enrollees in group products. The Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program paid 39 percent of what it initially projected to pay for claims per enrollee. The number of claims paid per enrollee was also lower than initial projections. While the early claims experience was below expectations, it is still too early to determine whether this trend will continue or whether adjustments to the projected claims experience or premiums are indicated, because most claims are not expected to be submitted for many years.", "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) included $4 billion for the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Clean Water State Revolving Fund (SRF) and $2 billion for the agency's Drinking Water SRF. This testimony is based on GAO's ongoing review of clean and drinking water projects. It provides preliminary observations on (1) the status and use of Recovery Act SRF program funds nationwide and in nine selected states, (2) jobs funded by the Recovery Act SRF programs and federal and state efforts to oversee the programs, and (3) challenges, if any, that states have faced in implementing Recovery Act requirements. For this ongoing work, GAO is, among other things, obtaining and analyzing EPA nationwide data on the status of Recovery Act clean and drinking water funds and projects, as well as information from a nonprobability sample of nine states that it had not reviewed in previous bimonthly reports. These states represent all but one of EPA's 10 regions. GAO is also interviewing EPA and state officials about their experiences with the Recovery Act clean and drinking water funds Nationwide, the 50 states have awarded and obligated the almost $6 billion in Clean Water and Drinking Water SRF program funds provided under the Recovery Act and reported using the majority of these funds for sewage treatment infrastructure and drinking water treatment and distribution systems, according to EPA data. These funds supported more than 3,000 water quality infrastructure projects nationwide. Since the Recovery Act was passed, states have drawn down $3.1 billion (79 percent) of the Clean Water SRF program funds and $1.7 billion (83 percent) of the Drinking Water SRF program funds provided under the Recovery Act. States also met the act's requirements that at least (1) 20 percent of the funds provided be used to support \"green\" projects, such as those that promote energy or water efficiency, and (2) 50 percent of the funds provide additional subsidies in the form of loans for which the principal is forgiven, loans for which the repayment is less than the principal (negative interest loans), or grants. In the nine states GAO reviewed, Recovery Act funds have paid for 419 infrastructure projects that help to address major water quality problems, although state officials said that in some cases, Recovery Act requirements changed their priorities for ranking projects or the projects selected. For example, because some projects could not meet the act's requirement to have funds under contract by February 17, 2010, some states provided Recovery Act funds to lower-ranked projects. Some states provided funding to these priority projects in other ways, such as through state grants or non-Recovery Act SRF funds. In addition, although not required by the Recovery Act, the nine states used 24 percent of the funds they received to pay for projects in economically disadvantaged communities, the majority of which was provided as additional subsidies. States reported that the Recovery Act SRF programs funded an increasing amount of full-time equivalent (FTE) positions from the quarter ending December 2009 through the quarter ending June 2010, from 6,000 FTEs to 15,000 FTEs, declining to 6,000 FTEs for the quarter ending in March 2011 as projects were completed. EPA and the states are overseeing Recovery Act projects and funds using EPA's oversight plan, updated in June 2010 in response to recommendations GAO made to specify procedures for oversight. The fiscal year 2010 and 2011 appropriations for the SRF programs continue the green project and additional subsidy requirements. State officials GAO interviewed identified challenges in implementing these requirements for the Clean and Drinking Water SRF programs, including: (1) Encouraging green projects. Officials in some states said that the goal of supporting green projects is important but that the percent of funds specifically dedicated to green funds (20 percent) was difficult to achieve. (2) Providing subsidies. Officials in several of the nine states noted that when monies are not repaid into revolving funds to generate future revenue for these funds, the SRF program purpose changes from primarily providing loans for investments in water infrastructure to providing grants.", "Pursuant to a congressional request, GAO reviewed how Department of State consulates process visas for visitors (nonimmigrants) to the United States, focusing on the: (1) extent and nature of visa processing backlogs in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and at other consulates; (2) factors affecting consulates' ability to process nonimmigrant visas in a timely manner; and (3) activities planned or under way to improve nonimmigrant visa processing. GAO noted that: (1) visa processing backlogs are a problem for some consulates, including the one in Sao Paulo; (2) the visa backlogs at the consulates GAO reviewed varied widely, ranging from 8 to 52 days; (3) the longest delays occurred during peak travel periods such as the summer months and winter holiday season; (4) factors that affected consulates' ability to process nonimmigrant visas in a timely manner included inadequate consular staffing and other staffing-related issues as well as inadequate computer systems, facilities, and other equipment; (5) an increased emphasis on preventing the entry of illegal immigrants, terrorists, and other criminals also contributed to delays; (6) State has initiatives under way to address staffing problems, upgrade equipment, and identify and implement practices that could improve visa processing at overseas posts; and (7) however, it does not systematically gather data on visa processing turnaround times and has not yet set specific timeliness standards to help guide its improvement program.", "Pursuant to a legislative requirement, GAO reviewed the Department of Defense's (DOD) use of single contracts for multiple base operations support functions, focusing on: (1) the history and characteristics of selected single contracts for multiple base operations support services; (2) the kinds of services procured under these contracts; (3) lessons DOD has learned from the use of these contracts; (4) whether small businesses participate in these contracts; and (5) whether cost and efficiency gains have been documented. GAO noted that: (1) the history and characteristics of selected single contracts for multiple base operations support services varied at the 10 installations GAO reviewed; (2) the decisions to use a single contract for multiple services occurred in two ways; (a) at seven installations, the decision occurred at the time of a commercial activity, or OMB Circular A-76 study; and (b) in the other three cases, the decision was made at the time the installation or its current mission was established; (3) most of the contracts were awarded for 5 years and ranged from about $5.4 million to $100 million annually; (4) although some installations received extensive base operations support services through a single contract, none received all of its required services through a single contract; (5) at all 10 installations, base operations support requirements were met through some combination of single contracts for multiple services; (6) the kinds of services procured under the multiple service contracts also varied and were influenced by a number of factors; (7) comparing and contrasting services between contracts and installations to precisely say what services were included or excluded from individual contracts in comparison with others is difficult because there are no generally accepted definitions for base operations support services; (8) as a result, contracting officials often used the same or similar terms differently; (9) DOD officials at the 10 installations GAO reviewed have learned a number of lessons from their experiences with single contracts for multiple base operation support services; (10) although many contracting officials GAO spoke with stated that coordination is much easier when there is a single contract, they acknowledged problems can still arise; (11) at 3 of the 10 installations GAO reviewed, small businesses were participating in single contracts for multiple base operations support services; (12) in all three cases, the small business was the prime contractor and the contracts were awarded under various small business programs; (13) the Small Business Administration and DOD officials are aware that consolidating multiple base operation services into single contracts may reduce the participation of small business as prime contractors; (14) officials from both agencies have issued guidance for considering small businesses in contract consolidation decisions; and (15) although contracting officials reported efficiency gains, cost savings from using single contracts for multiple base operations support services are not documented."]}
