{"all_summary": ["advocacy group formation this step was started with stakeholder analysis and identifying the stakeholders . the prevalence of malnutrition and its related factors among students was determined and weaknesses and strengths of the nffp were analyzed . education and justification intervention regarding the literature review and expert opinion an educational group affiliated with the advocacy team has prepared educational booklets about nutritional information for each level degree . it leads the educational group to hold several meeting with the student s parents to justify them about the project and its benefit for their children . nutritional intervention the snack basket of the students was replaced with traditional nutritious and diverse foods . research and evaluation in this step the literacy and anthropometric indices bmi of students were assessed before and after the interventions . each student that was malnourished and poor has been taken into account for free food and nutritious snacks . this project is granted by shiraz university of medical sciences charities and welfare organization and education organization of fars province . demographic characteristics of school aged children in shiraz iran table 2 shows the frequency of subjects in different categories of bmi for age in non welfare and welfare groups of school aged children separately among boys and girls before and after a nutrition intervention based on advocacy process model in shiraz iran . the same as this study in other studies have also emphasized that there must be efforts to strengthen the capacity within the schools to deal with the nutritional problems either overweight obesity or malnutrition by using of educational and nutritional intervention .", "patients received the study treatment for 12 weeks followed by a 4week follow up period . eligible patients were at least 18 years old about to start a cycle of chemotherapy andor radiation therapy within 1 week of inclusion and had a nonmyeloid malignancy hb levels of 11.0 g dl or less a life expectancy of more than 24 weeks and an eastern cooperative oncology group performance status of 02 . blood transfusions were permitted at the primary physician s discretion if hb levels decreased to 8 g dl or less and such patients were considered treatment failures . complete blood count and tsat were done every 3 weeks and again 2 weeks after last treatment week 14 . complete laboratory assessment hb serum ferritin reticulocyte count transferrin tsat serum iron total iron binding capacity red cell indices white blood cell count with differential platelet count and serum chemistries were done at week 1 and at week 14 end of study . a significance criterion of p 0.05 was used in the analysis . for the 14 patients who completed the whole treatment period 12 weeks the mean hb level change was 2.1 g dl median 1.3 g dl range 0.2 g dl to 4.6 g dl p 0.0007 . although the role of esas is well established in treating caa big concerns were recently raised about the negative effect of esas on survival in some patients with cancer.911 concerns about the risk for thromboembolism in patients with cancer with higher hb levels who are receiving esa were also addressed in many trials.2223 in addition the possible immunosuppressive effects of blood product transfusions that may have relevance to neoplasia progression were addressed before.24 25 in our pilot study we tested the feasibility of using iron supplementation alone to treat anemia in patients with cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy without the use of esas or blood transfusion which could be a valid alternative especially for patients with curable cancers .", "the low risk of td for atypical antipsychotics is thought to result from their weak affinity for dopamine receptors . according to the mother one friend might have threatened made fun of him actually and after that patient stopped going out of house and displayed above mentioned symptoms . as neck dystonia increased the patient had a severe disability as patient had to keep his hands behind his head for the support . during 210 years of age patient was inattentive and mildly hyperactive . with average executive functioning and life skills he worked as an unskilled laborer in the neighborhood shops as a helping hand . the patient was treated with clonazepam 1 mg total dissolved solid tds tetrabenazine 25 mg tds trihexiphenidyl 2 mg bipolar disorder bd . this patient s severe dystonic neck movements developed within short period of 6 months of exposure to atypical antipsychotics risperidone 2 mg and then olanzapine 5 mg only which can cause minimal extrapyramidal side effects . the authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms . the patients understand that their names and initials will not be published and due efforts will be made to conceal their identity but anonymity can not be guaranteed .", "although immune pathways can be generally and non specifically inhibited by pesticides they also are a likely source of candidate molecules that could be inhibited for target specific insect control since multiple classes of insect immunity genes including signaling pathways can be under strong selection for diversification . as such the investigation of insect immune pathways and mechanisms of pathogen modulation can yield insights into components that may be susceptible to inhibition . as such for the remainder of this review we focus on pathways leading to amp gene expression . in d. melanogaster nfb dependent amp induction through the toll and imd pathways is activated by detection of microbial components via different pattern recognition receptors prrs . upon interaction with mamps prrs can directly agglutinate pathogens or trigger proteolytic signaling cascades and cytokine release which in turn lead to the activation of downstream cellular and humoral pathways including pro po activation and amp gene expression 16 65 76 . also in contrast to the situation in d. melanogaster highly purified lps and lta are inducers of amp gene expression in lepidoptera though not as potently as crude lps with contaminating pgn or purified pgn 85 90 96 97 . such derived grp and pgrps may contribute to lepidopteran specific transduction of signals to downstream pathways . some of the basic components of the toll pathway are present in lepidoptera figure 2 . for example in contrast to what is known in d. melanogaster the m. sexta toll pathway is activated by gram negative associated mamps 115 118 . the relatively large sizes of last instar larvae of many lepidopteran species will facilitate biochemical approaches to such studies while the establishment of immune inducible lepidopteran cell lines such as the uga cie1 cell line can enable the characterization of molecular mechanisms leading to imd pathway activation and its contribution to amp gene expression .", "syncope is caused by transient diffuse cerebral hypoperfusion and is characterized by transient loss of consciousness with a rapid onset followed by spontaneous and complete recovery . she was diagnosed with epileptic seizures but continued to have episodes during treatment with the antiepileptic drugs aeds phenytoin levetiracetam and lamotrigine . a head ct showed recurrence of the glomus jugulare tumor and communicating hydrocephalus . an external ventricular drain evd after placement of the evd her drowsiness gradually started to improve and episodes decreased in frequency to one per day . this case highlights the fact that cough syncope a rare form of syncope may be associated with intracranial mass lesions that indirectly exaggerate the increase in icp in response to cough .", "although mir210 has been shown to be involved in regulation of physiological processes in various diseases and to be an up regulated mirna in testes of noa patients it remains unknown how mir210 affects spermatogenesis . after the specific treatment with standard procedure immunohistochemistry staining as described as lian et al . . briefly rna extraction was performed following a standard

we detected the expression of igf2 in cases with ma hypospermatogenesis and oa but not in the scos patients . expression of igf2 protein was also significantly lower in the nt2 cells transfected with mir210 mimics than in control cells and knockdown of mir210 with mir210 inhibitor increased protein expression of igf2 figures 6 .", "in our institute one of the main tokyo city perinatal centers there are 3 japanese systems of midwife led delivery care as follows 1 those intending to give birth at home managed by midwives who do not belong to our hospital 2 those planning to give birth on futons i.e. in addition informed consent for analysis from a retrospective database was obtained from each subject during their hospital visit . a retrospective study was performed to examine trends in transfers and perinatal outcomes among labors that started using the 3 systems of midwife led primary delivery care . in this study student s t test was used for continuous variables and the test for categorical variables . table 1 shows the clinical descriptions of the 678 pregnant women initially considered as low risk for receiving our midwife led primary delivery care systems . the total rate of transfers in the system run by the midwives belonging to our hospital 56 was higher than in the other 2 systems run by the independent midwives 31 in planned home birth or 1.87 95 ci 1.23.0 p 0.01 38 in planned hospital birth or 2.51 95 ci 1.73.8 p 0.01 . there were no significant differences in these outcomes among the 3 groups our obstetric care system involves the division of women in labor into low and high risk groups 912 . if complications occur or risk factors arise during labor in the primary midwife led care they are transferred to obstetric shared care . this may be the first report concerning the differences in the timing of transfers from midwife led care to obstetric shared care among the 3 systems of midwife led primary delivery care in japan . during the period the main indications for transfers were maternal postpartum hemorrhage andor neonatal respiratory distress associated with asphyxia .", "there were 195 male workers age 48.26.7 yr bmi 24.672.64 kg m who were diagnosed as diabetics during medical examinations conducted from march 2004 to october . subjects were included if they met one of the criteria below and their onset age was older than 20 yr old to exclude type 1 diabetes 1 blood sugar level before a meal exceeded 126 mg dl twice or more 2 blood sugar level before a meal exceeded 126 mg dl once or more and blood sugar level two hours after a meal exceeded 200 mg dl 3 those who reported that he had a history of diabetes in the questionnaire and being taken oral hypoglycemic agents . we also measured height and weight to calculate bmi . the fasting blood level was analyzed by glucose oxidase assay using an autochemistry analyzer . the method of genotyping used to identify the k121q polymorphism in enpp1 exon 4 was polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism pcr rflp using dna treated with a restriction enzyme after pcr based on the paper reported by abate et al . the hardy weinberg equilibrium was computed based on the goodness of fit test . we also investigated the differences in frequencies of genotypes between type 2 diabetic and normal groups and between obesity and normal groups by fisher s exact test . obesity is a main risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes 20 and there is linear association between obesity and type 2 diabetes 3 . the frequencies of the q allele investigated in this study might have a smaller statistical power to explain any association with either type 2 diabetes or obesity with 121q carriers kqqq andor the q allele . in conclusion the present study suggests that the enpp1 k121q polymorphism was not associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity .", "lipid apheresis is an alternative form of treatment for these fh patients as well as those who have persistently elevated ldl levels despite treatment . potential homozygous fh hofh patients were defined as having an untreated ldl 500 mg dl or a treated on statin ldl over 300 mg dl in addition to clinical evidence of xanthomas before age of 10 years or having two parents with heart disease or high lipids . unverifiable events noted in the ehr but occurring prior to the first documented ehr visit were noted but excluded from the cardiac event rate calculation . mean acute ldl reductions were calculated by averaging all recorded ldl values prior to and immediately after the treatment sessions . descriptive statistics are displayed as means and sds for continuous variables number and percentage with characteristic are given for categorical variables . four 36.4 patients were currently on statins while the other 7 63.6 had a history of statin intolerance . the patients self reported a total of 44 cardiac events before apheresis and 8 cardiac events after apheresis . the cardiac event rates were calculated to be 0.23 0.13 0.39 events per person year in the preapheresis group and 0.10 0.041 0.21 events per person year in the postapheresis group p 0.064 . this study was conducted to gain more information on lipid apheresis and evaluate the effectiveness in lowering lipid values . the event rate reduction was not statistically significant but showed a strong trend toward cardiac event rate reduction before and after apheresis .", "a 33year old male with no family history of thrombophilia who had experienced multiple recurrent episodes of dvt over a 15year

hemoglobulin plasma protein c plasma protein s fibrinogen and antithrombin iii levels the results of the kidney and liver function tests and resistance to activated protein c were all normal . since we attributed the agenesis of the ivc to be the underlying cause of the recurrent episodes of the dvts the patient was started on anticoagulant therapy subcutaneous enoxaparin 160 mg day for dvt antibiotic therapy intravenous vancomycin 1.5 g day for mrsa skin infection and referred to a vascular surgeon specialist but the patient refused . at follow up in the internal medicine clinic the most outstanding clinical findings were swelling of left ankle redness with trophic skin changes and a mild improvement of the skin ulcers . despite several phone calls for follow up the normal ivc is composed of 4 segments hepatic suprarenal renal and infrarenal . since many transformations can occur during the formation of the ivc such anomalies occur in 0.3 of otherwise healthy individuals and in 0.6 to 2 of patients with other cardiovascular anomalies.4 ruggeri et al reported 10 years ago 4 cases of congenital absence of the ivc in 75 young patients with idiopathic dvt over a 5year period and estimated that 5 of young patients with dvt had an anomaly of the ivc.5 venous thrombosis is caused by the presence of isolated or combined risk factors .", "there is now a scientific consensus that the pathological events in ad initiate decades before clinical symptoms become apparent and if disease modification is realized in the coming decades the need for improved methods of early detection prior to the overt clinical signs will be accentuated . in this study we examined the usefulness of brief neuropsychological tests in combination with blood a140 and a142 as a predictive test for detecting mci ad in at risk older adults at a pre symptomatic stage . due to significant intercorrelations between these tests analyses described below are limited to those baseline cognitive tests that were sensitive to early changes i.e. verbal learning and memory associated with mci ad or tests that were similar to those previously shown to be associated with a levels . a more comprehensive neuropsychological assessment was also administered by a neuropsychologist as part of the dementia work up . of the 215 subjects who gave blood for the ancillary study two developed non ad dementia and of the remaining subject pool of 208 used in these analyses 28 subjects met criteria for either ad n 10 or mci n 18 in the two years following blood draw . only 23 of the cognitively normal individuals had serum a142 in the lowest quartile compared to the nearly 50 of the diagnostic group 44 of mci subjects and 50 of ad subjects . cox regression analysis showed that a142 measured

categorized as 50 5060 and 60 years there were statistically significant differences in rad6 expression between the groups p 0.0008 although there is substantial variability table 2 . a 20 discrepancy of positively stained cells between the two evaluators was observed in fewer than 5 of the cases and these cases were evaluated together to establish a consensus reading . this study was not designed to test whether the distribution of the tumor cells positive for rad6 is the same between the subtypes of nevi . approximately 93 of nevi expressed catenin in more than 50 of the cells whereas only 27 of the same population of nevi expressed rad6 figure 2 . in this study we examined the association between rad6 and catenin expressions in benign and malignant melanocytic tumors to determine whether rad6 works in concert with catenin to influence melanoma development and progression . rad6 and catenin positively regulate each other in breast cancer 15 18 . accumulation of nuclear and cytoplasmic catenin has been implicated in driving the development and progression of several cancer types e.g. however our results are consistent with the lack of nuclear catenin reported in four studies which comprised 57 nevi more than 55 primary melanomas and 20 metastatic melanomas 21 3537 . the percentage of cases that expressed catenin on the cell membrane increased dramatically from 10 in nevi to 83 and 93 in primary and metastatic melanomas respectively . we are showing a striking upregulation of rad6 from a negative expression in most benign melanocytic tumors to 100 of primary and metastatic melanomas .", "all reactions were conducted with 75 mm napi buffer at ph 7.4 at 22 c . in the riboflavin mediated oxidations this result was anticipated because riboflavin is a type i photooxidant and effects oxidation by electron transfer from dg yielding o2 under aerobic reaction conditions . the current results differ from those previously reported by our laboratory when lysine was adducted to dg in analogous oxidation reactions . in comparison to these results the 5dsi diastereomers gave ecd spectra that were different than dsp but showed a similarity in the low energy lobe figure 4 . after oxidation of these odn systems they were digested with a suite of nucleases and phosphatase to the nucleosides followed by analysis using the previously described hplc methods . these results clearly demonstrate a dependence on the reaction context in formation of dg oxidation products and nh3 adducts . because of the limitation imposed by the inability to detect the bis ammonium adduct or to understand its decomposition pathway any comparison between the ammonia adduct distributions would be based on poorly defined assumptions consequently further discussion of these results is not provided . on the basis of this observation polymerase insertion assays opposite dsp vs 5dsi were conducted to determine if these h bonding schemes applied during the selection of a nucleotide to

and encyclopedic literature reviews describe the many potential roles that apoe plays in ad 2326 this focused review will concentrate on the interaction between a and apoe and other inflammatory proteins on the effects of such interactions and on their implications for designing apoe based ad therapies . together these results show that inflammatory proteins particularly apoe are integral parts of the amyloid cascade and that without them the cascade would be arrested at the level of the harmless a monomer and no ad would ensue . the view of apoe as an integral and pathological part of the amyloid cascade has been shaken by experiments that suggest that apoe far from being an amyloid catalyst serves to clear a from the brain . it was proposed that human apoe might serve to inhibit a clearance from the brain compared to mouse apoe with apoe4 inhibiting clearance the most . the possibility that interaction with apoe modulated an a clearance mechanism appeared to be supported by the finding that introduction of anti a antibodies or other abinding proteins such as gelsolin led to a reduced amyloid load in the brain and rapidly improved cognition with little evidence of abinding agents invading the brain parenchyma 4154 . in contrast in the complete absence of apoe the mutant app gene and its product a are harmless generating neither amyloid deposits synaptic disfunction or cognitive decline with one copy of apoe having an intermediate effect as discussed above . even though the key predictions of the polymerization hypothesis that is apoe serving as an a filament catalyst have been borne out the compelling experiments demonstrating that human apoe inhibits filament formation in a mouse background require explanation . clearly the interaction of neuroinflammation microglia and amyloid load is complex and the fact that bexarotene cures ad in mice is more likely to be despite rather than because it stimulates expression of apoe . although a

n56oxo m1dg were synthesized as previously described . a m z 320 peak was not observed for n56oxo m1dg indicating that no unlabeled 6oxo m1dg was present in the internal standard . the mixture was kept at this ph for 1 h. then the ph was increased to 8.5 by the careful addition of 1 m aqueous ammonium hydroxide solution . 6oxo m1dg m1dg and structural analogues that were used as competitive antigens during elisa analysis of murine sera hybridomal supernatant and purified antibodies . the filtered gel was washed with 10 ml of pbs and the analytes were eluted with 2 ml of methanol . the specificity of antibodies produced by two hybridoma cell lines b and e2 subcloned from the parental hybridoma cell line 6c9 were assessed using competitive elisa analysis . the purified anti6oxo m1dg mab was covalently linked to sepharose beads as described above . 6oxo m1dg was detected in the feces of each of three different sprague dawley rats but was detected in the urine of only one of the rats table 2 . this idea is consistent with the finding that m1dg is present in rodent and human genomic dna and with studies from this laboratory demonstrating that 6oxo m1dg is the sole metabolite of m1dg . given that the analytical method described herein is applicable to feces and urine the possibility exists for preclinical or clinical studies conducted in a noninvasive fashion .", "the 100mm visual analogue scale vas of allodynia and electric shock like pain was rated between 70 and 80 mm on a scale from 0 no pain to 100 worst pain imaginable . with the patient s informed consent left t3 tfemi identification of the t3 nerve root sheath and epidural space was performed using contrast media fig . then 100 mg of magnesium sulphate and 1 ml of 0.2 ropivacaine total volume 2 ml was carefully injected . one week after the last procedure the vas score of allodynia decreased to 15100 and all medications except pregabalin were discontinued . to our knowledge no previous report has described about the magnesium administration by the transforaminal epidural route in patients with neuropathic pain . among the currently available nmda receptor antagonists ketamine is the most widely used one for the treatment of neuropathic pain . furthermore even if the dose of intravenously administered magnesium is not sufficient to present toxicity patients are still at risk of magnesium overdose . neuraxial administration of magnesium is an off label use and the safety of this technique in human subjects is still undetermined . in conclusion tfemi showed a favourable result in the treatment of intractable allodynia associated with phn .", "central retinal vein occlusion crvo is a common sight threatening vascular disease with prevalence rates ranging from 0.11 to 0.52 in the older adult population . this prospective interventional study was performed between june 1 2012 and february 1 2014 . uwfa using the optos 200t imaging system was obtained in each case before the first injection . sd oct volume scans 2015 with 19 horizontal sections art 9 sd oct heidelberg engineering heidelberg germany of the macula were obtained for each study eye to measure the central subfield thickness cst in m by using heidelberg sd oct software significant macular ischemia was ruled out by uwfa . the wide field color images and wide field fa images were used to identify the vortex vein ampullae which were located near the ocular equator.27 based on another published work we defined retinal nonperfusion as at least five disc areas of hypofluorescence28 representing retinal nonperfusion or capillary dropout or areas of microvascular pathology multiple microaneurysms and significant perivascular leakage on uwfa . because of the effect of upper and lower eyelid and eyelashes the far periphery in the horizontal plane alone the nasal and temporal retina was analyzed . collected parameters included demographic information previous ocular history number and dates of intravitreal injections central subfield thickness peripheral retinal ischemia central intraretinal fluid visual acuity and intraocular pressure throughout the study period as well as the occurrence of any complications . a p value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant . this observation could explain the requirement for more frequent intravitreal anti vegf injections of in crvo patients with macular edema and peripheral retinal nonperfusion . this finding is important because an evaluation of the peripheral retina using uwfa may be a prognostic factor and allows the ophthalmologists to estimate the requirement for more or fewer intravitreal injections based on the peripheral retinal perfusion status .", "in addition the closure of mesenteric defects is questioned in a substantial body of literature . any patients presenting with signs and symptoms of an sbo were emergently taken to the operating room . in all cases an intraoperative endoscopy was used to check the gastrojejunal anastomosis and drains were used in all male patients because of higher technical difficulty and higher rates of mortality and morbidity in patients with a bmi over 50 for the same reasons and in selected cases . there was one conversion to an open operation for an incomplete malrotation there was no mortality . the jejunojejunostomy was formed with a single firing of the same stapler and the enteroenterostomy was closed with the stapler . the surgical literature has many articles that discuss ih formation and an area of contention has been closure versus nonclosure of the mesenteric defects . rodriguez et al also reported that minimal division of the mesentery could lead to a decrease in ih formation . these outcomes indicate that closure of the defects may not be as permanent as surgeons would like to believe and indeed this very situation was the catalyst for this paper . also the incidence of sbo caused by adhesions is higher in the current study than in some others . the author lives in a geographically isolated part of the country with no other surgeons who are willing to care for bariatric patients and so it was more likely that all the sbos would be treated by the same bariatric surgeon .", "an entry hole was created at the center of the distal femur and proximal tibia for the insertion of the cement rod . follow up laboratory studies including erythrocyte sedimentation rate and c reactive protein culture study via knee aspiration and a frozen biopsy from the second stage operation 5 polymorpho leukocytes high power field were performed to confirm successful eradication of the infection . the second stage reimplantation was performed using the rectus snipping approach and more than 90 of flexion was obtained intra operatively . this maintains knee stability in combination with early muscle strengthening exercises including quadriceps setting exercise and enables the patient to comfortably dress and manage him herself during the intervening period . in addition symmetric maintenance of the soft tissue of both medial and lateral gutters requires no additional soft tissue balancing at the second stage reimplantation . in addition a metal nail can not be removed easily at the second stage reimplantation due to its hardness and soft tissue adhesion of the femoral or tibial medullary canals . on the other hand an antibiotic impregnated cement rod enjoys advantages such as inexpensive antibiotic delivery to the marrow spaces and easy removal by using a hercules cutter . in addition a static spacer is anchored to the cement rod which can prevent spacer migration and bone erosion . during the conduct of the antibiotic impregnated cement rod technique antibiotic impregnated cement was applied to the proximal tibia distal femur joint gap space suprapatellar pouch and both gutters in a stepwise manner .", "they performed cognitive tests focused on information processing speed attention and working memory . the complex sub test also included the same mouse clicking procedure but at the same time the subject was asked to count how many instances of a specific digit between zero and nine randomly chosen he she could see . a comparison between groups was done by t test and analysis of covariance ancova . the total score for the cprs scale taken from the depression and anxiety subscale was also rated significantly higher in the stroke group compared to controls see table 2 figure 1 . the participants from the stroke group were significantly slower on the test measuring information processing speed primarily digit symbol coding and also reading speed and number of mouse clicks in the computer test . the mean level of eight for the stroke subjects corresponds to 16 on madrs indicating an overall mild level of depression . there was a highly significant difference between the groups on their self assessment of mental fatigue with a mean value of 18 reported for the almost recovered stroke group and a mean value of four for the control group . in this study three items were overlapping between mental fatigue and depression and these items were rated on a higher level than the corresponding specific items on the depression sub scale see figure 2 . few studies have been carried out which cover fatigue and cognitive performance following a stroke . with more demanding and sensitive tests including processing speed and complex attention it may be possible to detect cognitive impairments accompanying mental fatigue .", "in a previous study it was shown that inhibition of oxidative stress exerts protection in human endothelial cells which could be an effective strategy in the treatment of vascular diseases . a tunel assay system was used according to the manufacturer s instructions for examination under a fluorescence microscope with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 525 nm . after pretreatment of acrolein stimulated cells with krg the cells were fixed and cox2 localization in huvecs was observed by immunofluorescence staining with an anti cox2 antibody followed by a fluorescence tagged secondary antibody . these results indicate that krg may play a role in the inhibition of cox2 expression via reduction of acrolein generated ros in acrolein stimulated huvecs . to confirm this result we evaluated the presence of dead cells by tunel staining which is widely used in detecting dna fragmentations in situ . there is increasing evidence that unsaturated aldehydes in cs including acrolein and crotonaldehyde play an important pathophysiological role in vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and alzheimer s disease . chronic inflammation plays an important role in vascular diseases therefore cox2 may participate in the development of inflammation related diseases including vascular diseases . krg has been reported to have effective pharmacological activities including antioxidant anticarcinogenic and ameliorative effects on blood circulation . hien et al demonstrated the anti inflammatory and antiatherosclerotic activities of ginsenoside rg3 in human endothelial cells with a decrease of cell adhesion molecules and proinflammatory cytokines . p38 mapk creb and intracellular ros generation are involved in this inhibition of cox2 expression in acrolein stimulated huvecs by krg .", "2015 . we generated 36 independent transgenic lines and amplicon sequencing of randomly selected events confirmed biallelic mutations in all cases zhou et al . 2009 . the results serve as testament to the superiority of crispr cas9 over previous gene silencing methods . 2014 . after our initial publication successful crispr cas9 editing was reported for populus tomentosa fan et al . because mature grnas are released following cleavage of the polycistronic transcript by the trna processing machinery there is no sequence constraint at the 5 end of grnas xie et al . as discussed above numerous studies have exploited sequence polymorphisms for developing gene or allele specific grnas to achieve precision editing by crispr cas9 . a recent population genomics study of 544 populus trichocarpa individuals identified 17.9 million m snps by whole genome resequencing evans et al . tool is particularly useful for screening custom grnas or pcr primers against known snps indels in the p. trichocarpa or the custom 717 genome xue et al .", "edx data were collected in the form of spectrum images in which a focused electron probe was scanned in a raster across a region of interest in the scanning tem stem . x ray intensities were obtained by fitting a model of the edx spectra to the experimental data using weighted least squares and atomic fractions were quantified from intensities using the cliff lorimer quantification . the edx elemental maps for cobalt iron and oxygen figure 1b d obtained by integration of the element s background subtracted k line x ray peak show that individual particles are comprised of a cobalt core surrounded by a shell composed of iron and oxygen as expected . the largest particle in the lower left region of the map appears to have more iron in the core compared to the smaller particles . the first three principal components pc0 pc1 and pc2 exhibited significantly greater variance than the remaining components figure 2a which suggests that there are only three phases present in the sample . if we disregard the small copper peaks contained in all the independent components likely originating from the copper support mesh we see that ic0 contains cobalt x ray peaks ic1 iron and oxygen peaks and ic2 a carbon peak . the particle morphologies were found to have a mean core diameter of approximately 3.3 nm and mean shell thickness of approximately 1.7 nm figure 4a . in order to verify the accuracy of the ica results we evaluated whether ic0 represented the true composition of the core by analyzing bare fept seed particle clusters obtained from the same chemical synthesis but extracted prior to the shell addition step . a comparison of raw edx spectra extracted from fept bimetallic seed particles and from pure fe3o4 particles with ic0 and ic1 respectively is provided in figure 6 . the use of ica on edx spectrum image data promises to be a powerful technique for extracting buried compositions at the nanoscale in a variety of materials and further testing on the method s applicability to different systems is now being initiated .", "increases in the concentration of intracellular ca activate specific protein targets among which the ca calmodulin dependent protein kinase ii camkii is a critical signal mediator . because of its capacity to remain activated long after the initial pulse of ca signaling camkii perpetuates ca effects and modulates gene expression and the epigenetic profile of postsynaptic neurons . camkii also participates in glucose stimulated insulin secretion gsis as multiple insulin secretagogues increase camkii activity . one hundred and fifty islets were handpicked under a light microscope and pre incubated for 1 h in krbb krebs bicarbonate buffer containing 0.3 the medium was discarded and the islets incubated for an additional hour in 500l krbb containing 2.8 or 16.8 mm glucose . in order to investigate metabolic memory of insulin producing cells we first had to develop a paradigm in which such memory was evident . as detailed below we established that exposure of cultured min6 cells to four 1h pulses of high glucose interspersed with 7h intervals of low glucose and thus mimicking postprandial glucose spikes in vivo were able to elicit robust metabolic memory . as shown in figure 1b min6 cells exposed to the glucose pulse regimen showed higher insulin secretion both when exposed to low 2.8 mm or high 16.8 mm glucose than cells which had been cultured continuously at low glucose . in parallel the phosphorylation of camkii was higher in the glucose pulse group at both glucose concentrations and remained elevated even after the glucose concentration was reduced to 2.8 mm figure 1f . cerasi and colleagues had previously reported time dependent potentiation of insulin secretion in that exposure of rat islets to high glucose 27.7 mm up to 60 min prior to the test stimulation with glucose increased subsequent insulin secretion . this process presented schematically in figure 4 is dependent on the activation of camkii as is the case for neuronal memory .", "the health state of a person can be described in terms of capacity to carry out a set of tasks or actions . fsi is a crucial element for the description of health states and quantification of overall health status in individuals that can be aggregated to a summary measure of population health . undoubtedly the primary reason that icf can plausibly claim to be a universal tool for classifying states of functioning and disability is that the underlying model of the icf reflects our best understanding of the complex phenomena of functioning and disability in a manner that is to the greatest extent possible theory neutral and therefore compatible with whichever theoretical account of how disability arises at the individual and population levels that evidence may confirm . decrements in functioning may be the result of decrements in intrinsic capacity or problems with body functions or structures or they can result from features of the person s physical human built or social environment that lead to problems in performance over and above decrements in capacity . the classifications in the first part identify all of the domains of functioning from basic physiological functions and body structures to simple and complex actions tasks social performances and relationships . for measurement purposes this level of capacity presumes a standardized assessment environment namely one that reveals the inherent capacity of a person in a specific functional domain without any particular enhancements . given that it has been designed for a multiplicity of uses and users there is far more in icf than could ever be plausibly integrated into a viable coding system for health records although it remains the ultimate lexicon to which any coder for clinical or research purposes could turn . such a checklist was produced and used during the beta 1 and 2 field testing phase in the revision process world health organization 2001 . 2002 . the recognition that a description of health and health related outcomes must go beyond a narrow view of health restricted to the absence of disease as well as that the definition of disability must move beyond the narrow impairment based view that has been traditionally adopted to define a minority population will go a long way in bridging the gap between health and disability data .", "testing for hiv began in 1985 with the introduction of the enzyme immunoassay eia . maternal characteristics including race parity age singleton versus multiple gestation and a diagnoses of diabetes or hypertension were obtained using the obstetrics operations database . categorical data were reported as frequencies and statistical significance was determined using analysis . compared to hiv negative patients false positive patients were more likely to be nulliparous 43 versus 31 p 0.001 and younger mean age 23.9 5.7 versus 26.2 5.9 p 0.001 . the specificity of the hiv eia test was 99.7 with a positive predictive value of 54.3 . table 2 shows the prevalence of diabetes hypertension hepatitis b and results of syphilis testing in the study population . however when the hiv testing groups positive false positive negative are stratified by parity the comparison of age across the three groups remains significant only in nulliparous women table 3 p 0.0003 . this information could be useful for counseling women who test positive for hiv at delivery and emphasizes the limitations of eia testing if used as a rapid test to determine the need for intrapartum and neonatal antiretroviral prophylaxis . they found that while there were no false positive tests with the oraquick there were seven false positives using the eia ppv 100 versus 35.7 . our study found that the positive predictive value of eia testing was only 54.3 and that younger nulliparous women were more likely to test falsely positive .", "the increasing occurrence of disorders such as type 2 diabetes during childhood is believed to be a consequence of this obesity epidemic . gas6 expression is widespread in many tissues including immune cells endothelial cells vascular smooth muscle cells and adipocytes 79 . this suggests that the gas6axl signaling might play a role in the pathogenesis of obesity associated systemic inflammation 8 16 17 . the gas6 rs819174 genotypes were not significantly associated with any anthropometric characteristics and biochemistry in girls . we found that the gas6 rs8191973 or rs8191974 genotypes were not significantly associated with circulating gas6 protein

associated with any abnormal variables in both boys and girls data not shown . moreover the combination of both gas6 polymorphisms had an additive effect on the development of obesity and obesity associated inflammation in boys . the authors also reported the expression of gas6 and its 3 receptors tyro3 axl mer in murine adipose tissues thus suggesting that gas6 may act in an autocrine andor paracrine manner to promote murine adipose tissue development . our findings indicated that axl gene polymorphisms might not play a significant role in childhood obesity .", "subjects had referred to the fertility and infertility center of esfahan from september 2013 to march 2014 . if the circumstances were inappropriate filling of the questionnaire was delayed for 2 h. research data were analyzed using spss software version 16 spss inc . but the level of depression after pickup 31.7 was significantly lower than before the induction 39.7 p 0.007 . the relation between mental health dimensions and background variables after ovulation stimulation the level of depression after egg harvesting was related to physical condition depression and social impairment independent from underlying variables . the present study aimed to assess the level of mental health in fertile women undergoing assisted reproductive treatments as a result of male factor infertility at the beginning of ovulation stimulation process and the effect of this process on their mental health . but the level of depression and anxiety disorders at the beginning of ovulation stimulation was higher in the present research than other reports . a qualitative study showed that iranian infertile couples show emotional reactions such as fear concern anxiety and depression as a result of fear of the failure of treatment during fertility treatment . however these mental disorders may be harmful even for women with appropriate fertility potentials . positive correlation between the level of depression and anxiety and other dimensions of experiences during infertility treatment might be accompanied with social impairment thus affecting the levels of depression and anxiety . one of this study s limitations was that mental health assessment was conducted after starting the primary stages of the treatment therefore the stress of this stage could affect the mental health during the whole process .", "in individuals with suboptimal levels of vitamin d epidemiological studies have shown that vitamin d levels show seasonal variation 7 8 . fracture rates from falls in older adults also increase at the end of the winter season following two to eight weeks after the nadir in serum vitamin d levels . this repeated measures cohort study was designed to be able to detect differences in postural sway . data from eighty eight participants 70 females are included in the final analysis . five people did not attend appointments and five people could not complete testing because of medical events . no associations between postural sway and vitamin d were observed all p 0.05 . there was a significant relationship between postural sway and the number of injurious falls observed with lower values for sway range i.e. manipulation of our data in a similar way reveals that there were more falls during the autumn winter half year compared to spring summer table 2 . this may be explained by the higher proportion of summer time falls observed in our study . although this study aimed to recruit independently living community dwelling older adults bias in the sample may be present as volunteers to this type of research project may be more robust than the community members at large .", "aqueous leaf extract of s. alata has also been scientifically validated for its acclaimed use as an abortifacient 2 . the plant leaves obtained from herb sellers at oja tuntun new market in ilorin nigeria was authenticated at the herbarium unit of the forestry research institute

alkaloids was evaluated by adopting the procedure described by kanno et al . twenty four ovariectomized female rats 159.677.12 g were allocated to four groups a b c and d of six animals per group . group a controls orally received 0.5 ml of distilled water while animals in groups b c and d orally received 0.5 ml of the alkaloids corresponding to 250 500 and 1000 mg kg body weight respectively . in the present study alkaloids from s. alata leaves significantly affected the fetal and maternal parameters of the animals . therefore the high implantation index and pre and post implantation losses suggest that pregnancy was interrupted by the alkaloid probably creating an environment that was not conducive for the fertilized eggs .", "previous studies investigating the prognostic significance of erg gene rearrangements have revealed mixed results 1922 . studies from our group and others have also linked erg status to responsiveness to hormonal therapy and longer progression time to castration resistant disease compared to men with no erg expression 24 25 . briefly 4 m thick sections from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue blocks were stained with ventana autostainer . for each patient the two predominant patterns were sampled and included on the tmas for analysis . when we accounted for foamy type pca morphology the rate of erg expression was 1584 17.9 compared to 302704 42.9 in acinar pca cases with no foamy type morphology p 0.001 . figure 2 demonstrates examples of erg expression in tissue samples and the distribution of erg in relation to gleason score . this study reports on the potential significance of erg protein expression in localized prostate cancer . published reports on the significance of erg expression to patients outcome are conflicting with some showing association with adverse outcome while others document no association . however two earlier reports suggested adverse association of erg rearrangements with psa relapse after radical prostatectomy 20 31 . these observations suggest that the method utilized in determining erg status the inclusion or exclusion of other genomic aberration and the cohort chosen may be the reason for the different results obtained in various studies investigating the role of erg in prostate cancer .", "the three main arteries of the leg the anterior tibial artery ata posterior tibial artery and peroneal artery form a dense vascular network around the distal leg ankle and foot which ramifies perforators as the basis of all kinds of pedicle flaps such as lateral or medial malleolar perforator flaps . the objective of this study was to identify the anatomic parameters of the asma and its perforators that would enable microsurgeons to harvest potentially multi paddle flaps or composite flaps from the foot and ankle region . we try to preserve the ata intact after we harvest the composite flaps around the ankle using asma . type c n 6 is similar to type b with the lateral and medial branches arising from the ata but at different origins figure 3a and b . the medial branch gives off ascendant perforators and descendent perforators a type c the anterior supramalleolar artery originates as lateral and medial artery branches at the different point . 1 medial branches 2 lateral branches 3 proximal end of anterior tibial artery ata 4 distal end of ata 5 extensor retinaculum b the anterior supramalleolar artery orients as one lateral and two medial arteries branches at different point the mean distance between the origin of the proximal branch of asma and the superior margin of the extensor retinaculum o r was 2.0 0.8 cm . later research showed that asma is always found in the distal 13 of the lower leg and appears 8 10 cm above the lateral malleolus 1 2 cm anterior to the edge of the fibula . the diameters of the lateral and medial branches of asma are 0.8 0.3 mm and 1.0 0.2 mm respectively . thus an island flap can be harvested based on one or both of the branches for defect coverage around the ankle . there are several factors which should be kept in mind during the clinical application of asma based flaps .", "although in the clinical setting ankle df prom is frequently measured under non weight bearing non wb conditions1 3 4 many researchers have stated that the wb position is more appropriate for estimating the amount of ankle df motion during functional activities5 6 . therefore the aim of the present study was to examine the influence of gastrocnemius stretching combined with joint mobilization on wb ankle df prom . all participants signed an informed consent form approved by the institutional research review committee of inje university prior to participation in this study . subjects stood in front of a wall and placed the leg being tested behind the contralateral leg in a lunge posture . for gastrocnemius stretching combined with joint mobilization subjects leaned forward against the wall in the same lunge posture as that during measurement of wb ankle df prom with knee extended until the maximum gastrocnemius stretch was felt . wb ankle df prom with knee extended was significantly increased in post intervention compared with pre intervention conditions 42.60 5.49 versus 38.24 4.69 p 0.001 . the addition of talocrural joint mobilization to gastrocnemius stretching is another possible explanation for our findings . 4.36 was similar to that found previously .", "group ii was treated with dld 25 mg kg d orally for 15 days and ip saline at day 11 . a longitudinal section of the left kidney and one half was fixed in 10 formalin then embedded in paraffin for histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations . from a standard curve nox content in the unknown sample was extrapolated from the corresponding absorbance using the regression line from the standard curve and expressed as nmol g tissue . dox 15 mg kg significantly increased renal mda and nox levels compared to control group . administration of both doses of dia concomitantly with dox decreased the expression of them compared to dox group . nephrotoxic action of dox is also considered to be via drug induced free radical generation . dia could significantly decrease serum urea and creatinine compared to dox treated group . catalase has been reported to be responsible for the detoxification of h2o2 which is an effective inhibitor of sod . our results are consistent with meng et al . the results demonstrated that rhein significantly improved the symptoms of nephropathy through decreasing the production of proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin 1 prostaglandin e2 and tnf.", "suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents and has become a significant public health issue globally 1 . we used data from the 2014 korea youth risk behavior web based survey kyrbs . if participants responded no at all of 2 58 we classified them into the appropriate wcb group . we further grouped overweight and obese groups into a single overweight group thus using three bmi categories body weight perception bwp was split into five categories very underweight underweight normal weight overweight and very overweight . we performed statistical analyses of the survey data using sas version 9.4 sas inc . after the purpose of the survey students were assured that they could refuse or withdraw from the research at any stage 16 . girls who underestimated or overestimated their body shape and engaged in inappropriate wcb showed significant association with suicide attempt underestimate or 1.89 p 0.001 overestimate or 1.73 p 0.001 compared to girls who do not engaged in wcb . therefore one possible interpretation of this finding is that wcb represent a risk factor for suicide ideation and attempt by causing depression or eating disorders both of which have serious consequences on adolescents mental health . interestingly both boys and girls engaging in regular exercise fasting and eating less were more likely to experience suicidal behaviors compared to those who did not conduct any wcb . inappropriate wcb among adolescents is a serious public health concern considering its widespread prevalence and harmful influence on growth physical health and psychosocial growth .", "upon excitation the conjugation across the ethylenic bridge of the chromophore is reduced and it will twist however the protein matrix prevents the chromophore from reaching the perpendicularly twisted conformation and fluorescence quenching internal crossing is prevented . when the chromophore is computationally permitted to freely rotate it will adopt a conformation that complements the protein matrix . therefore in an attempt to supplement the quantum calculations we have examined the conformational space available to the chromophore within gfp using a freely rotating chromophore that is an approximation based on qm calculations of the conformational space available to the chromophore in its excited state . plot of the vs dihedral angles see figure 1 for nomenclature for the 2000 gfp a pink gfp b green and gfp i light blue structures obtained in the freely rotating molecular dynamics simulation . these steps are probably linked with dissociation of the hydrogen bond between the chromophore and his148 or an intervening water molecule and to the barrier for chromophore twisting in the excited state respectively.70 in order to establish the consequences of the y66h mutation on the flexibility of the chromophore molecular dynamics simulations of the ph 8.5 bfp crystal structure pdb code 2emd with neutral imidazole rings for his66 and his148 with a freely rotating chromophore were run . given the high structural similarity between all the solid state structures of gfp mutants in the protein databank a thorough conformational search should find the lowest energy conformations of a5 by making the relevant mutations to the 2emd structure . figure 6 and table 1 show that the conformational space available to the chromophore in bfp is larger than that in a5 and that the bfp conformations tend to be further from planarity i.e. in half the structures sampled the n of the his66 imidazole ring hydrogen bonds to water302 which is in an extensive hydrogen bonding network with val68 arg224 and gln69 . 73 the resultant mutant yfp is red shifted by 16 nm relative to gfp s65 t and does indeed have a stacking interaction between the chromophore and tyr203.74 on the basis of the crystal structure of yfp remington et al . some have suggested that the crystal structures of strongly fluorescent gfp and gfp like proteins have their chromophores in a cis configuration while those of the nonfluorescent proteins are in a trans configuration .", "fnas can be performed without rose and in this setting the contents of the fna needles are typically expelled and rinsed in a cell preservative solution for use in liquid based cytology lbc preparations . this approach can help minimize the chances of encountering the scenario in which diagnostic cellular material is present on only one smear microdissection of the cells for molecular studies can result in sacrificing this only diagnostic slide in this context which can have medico legal consequences . in the past decade myriad studies have been reported demonstrating that a variety of cytologic samples and cytopreparatory platforms can be effectively utilized for egfr mutational analysis . nonetheless in light of the inherent disadvantages of cell blocks mentioned previously investigation into other cytopreparatory platforms for molecular diagnostic assays have been performed by our group and many others . the cell suspension can be divided and an aliquot is used to prepare a thinprep slide that is stained via the papanicolaou method similar to alcohol fixed papanicolaou stained direct smears . thus if one or more needle passes are high in tumor cell content whereas other needle passes contain a high proportion of benign cellular elements the tumor cells in the final pooled cell suspension will be diluted . in a phase 1 study evaluating 143

modify the intestinal microflora and when used as dietary supplement they have positive effects on health such as fortification of host immune function suppression of diarrhea and inhibition of carcinogenesis.6 kimchi a korean traditional food is fermented by probiotic lactic acid bacteria.7 kimchi lactic acid bacteria are known to suppress the activity of carcinogen activating enzymes such as azoreductase nitroreductase 7dehydrogenase glucosidase and glucuronidase and inactivate or neutralize the cancer causing agents and pathogenic microbes.8 in addition the intake of lactic acid bacteria as part of kimchi improves bowel movement strengthens immunity ameliorates hepatocirrhosis and decreases serum cholesterol levels.910 among lactic acid bacteria identified during the fermentation of kimchi weissella lactobacillus leuconostoc and pediococcus species are known to play an important role in kimchi fermentation.1113 this commentary deals with anticarcinogenic effects of kimchi and lactic acid bacteria weissella cibaria and lactobacillus plantarum separated from kimchi which are known to be predominant in kimchi . however unless one consumes kimchi that contains excess salt kimchi in general is a healthy food recognized for its antioxidant antiobese cancer preventive and other health beneficial effects.7 cancer preventive anticarcinogenic activity of kimchi is associated with the type of ingredients and products formed during fermentation.14 the kimchi s main ingredient chinese cabbage has been considered to be effective in preventing stomach cancer according to epidemiologic studies and is known to inhibit colorectal carcinogenesis due to its abundance in dietary fiber.15 garlic in particular has been acknowledged for its anticancer effect due to high contents of organosulfur compounds 11 to 35 mg g . it is a gram positive and catalase negative bacteria included in geneally recognized as safe.30 the main lactic acid bacteria involved in kimchi fermentation has long been known as lactobacillus genus and leuconostoc genus but more recently weissella genus lactic acid bacteria has been newly separately identified.30 weissella is an early dominant in kimchi fermentation and produces lactic acid acetic acid alcohol dextran and co2 which account for the unique fresh taste and texture of kimchi.3132 weissella species found in kimchi are w. cibaria w. koreensis and w. hanii.12 sources of each weissella species are shown in table 1.33 w. cibaria newly named by bjorkroth and others has been separated from korean kimchi and various other sources including fermented foods greek salami spanish sausages and animal and human excrements . among these lactic acid bacteria w. cibaria exhibited higher production of eps which indicates more acid resistance table 2.37 w. cibaria was reported to have anticancer activity immune modulating activity anti inflammatory activity and antioxidant activity . cell growth was suppressed by treatment of w. cibaria in colorectal cancer cells but not in normal cells . w. cibaria produced higher levels of nitric oxide nuclear factor nf b cytokines e.g. interleukin1 and tumor necrosis factor than lgg suggesting that w. cibaria is more effective in immune control compared to lgg . during the kimchi fermentation process the level of arginine an ornithine precursor has decreased while the ornithine level increased rapidly which suggested that kimchi is a source of ornithine . acid tolerance of l. plantarum allows us to use this bacterium for natural antibacterial and antifungal products . among lactic acid bacteria s cell wall substances polysaccharide types rather than glycopeptide play a pivotal role in cancer suppression.47 to evaluate the possible use of l. plantarum as

followed by bonferroni post hoc analysis . p 0.05 significantly different from the high fat diet control mice . these results suggest a key role for ceramide in mediating skeletal muscle insulin resistance and indicate that the other lipid metabolites possibly may not be as important in the insulin resistance development . examination of the lipid metabolite profile revealed that tag and long chain acyl coa levels were elevated in gastrocnemius muscle of db db controls versus db lean mice whereas unexpectedly dag and ceramide levels were similar between the two groups fig . prevention of insulin resistance in db db mice via myriocin treatment . although it may be possible that our model of insulin resistance is inducing mitochondrial dysfunction it is highly unlikely due to impairments in muscle fatty acid oxidative capacity as the rer values in obese mice reported in this study are very close to 0.7 indicating that these animals have no trouble utilizing fat as an energy source . although we believe that the changes accounting for the greater oxygen consumption rates in myriocin treated dio mice primarily reflect the muscle we can not ignore possible contributions from changes in other peripheral tissues such as brown adipose tissue and uncoupling protein activity .", "p 0.05 indicates comparisons performed between young and middle aged mice in

associated with many intrinsic and extrinsic factors including proinflammatory cytokine accumulation oxidative stress mitochondrial dysfunction insulin resistance and aging related loss of anabolic hormones and motor neuron end plates . although aging is associated with prolonged inflammatory activity that is mainly attributed to progressively worsening muscle weakness it is unclear whether these processes are cross talked . tnf is a cytokine implicated in the metabolic disturbance of chronic inflammation with the formation of il1 which has been identified as a circulatory factor to increase gluconeogenesis lipolysis and proteolysis accompanied with the decrease in protein lipid and glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle . tnf induces skeletal muscle loss through increased myofibrillar protein degradation and cell apoptosis thus resulting in muscle atrophy and the inhibition of muscle regeneration following injury 55 56 . furthermore the tissue specific inflammatory signaling pathways in response to cytokines along with the elevation of systemic cytokines are important elements to be considered . mirnas from noncoding rna genes or within protein coding genes are transcribed into primicrornas by rna polymerase ii or polymerase iii in some cases and subsequently embedded into premicrorna hairpins like rna duplex by drosha 73 74 . since a large number of mirnas have been identified in skeletal muscle the investigation of mirnas is a promising but relatively unexplored area for understanding the regulatory mechanisms of wasting process associated with cytokine expression and secretion in aging skeletal muscle . as reviewed here mirnas play major roles in the inflammatory regulation as the pivotal regulators for modulating cell functions or the

persisted up to postoperative week 16 fig . 2 3 . in our case corneal edema and the descemet s membrane fold were probably due to inadvertent corneal stromal injection with high dose gentamicin and dexamethasone rather than injection directly into the anterior chamber . we found the localized endothelial defect on specular microscopy manifesting as a definite dark acelluar area which corresponded to the area of the descemet s membrane fold and site of inadvertent stromal injection . on postoperative week four the corneal edema resolved and best corrected visual acuity improved to 0.7 . hansany and basu22 demonstrated that a 0.1 mg ml concentration of gentamicin was not toxic to the corneal endothelium until seven days postop but after seven days corneal endothelial toxicity was demonstrated for that concentration . therefore considering our case and this study we can conclude that immediate irrigation of the anterior chamber is important in preventing corneal endothelial damage when high dose antibiotics and steroids are injected in anterior chamber by mistake during cataract or other intraocular surgery . mcdonald et al.23 insisted that clear communication between the surgeon and nursing staff in addition to precise labeling of every injectable solution is necessary to prevent accidents such as this . in our case we reported a favorable visual outcome with

cells nrs are most likely also contributing to hnscc development and progression 12 13 . transcriptional regulation can either be ligand dependent or independent genomic or nongenomic allowing nrs to mediate gene repression or its release gene activation or gene trans repression details in 7 8 16 . despite their conserved structural organization nevertheless two major modes of nr action can be assigned depending on their intracellular steady state localization in the absence of ligands figure 3 . the beneficial effects of ppar ligands on malignancies were tested in several clinical trials but outcomes proved to be highly diverse . increasing knowledge about the mode of action specificity and dosage dependence of ppar agonistic and antagonistic ligands will hopefully allow a better modeling of ppar receptor function and thus lead to a more effective design of combinatorial application schemes for cancer treatment and cancer prevention in the future . moreover this strategy was supported by epidemiological data as well as by clinical trial outcomes 26 5961 . also certain retinoids inhibited the development of second primary tumors in patients who had been previously treated for an early stage cancer but remained at high risk to relapse 26 60 and references within . hence rar indeed seems to contribute to the suppression of the premalignant phenotype and malignancy and may be causally linked to the clinical outcome in chemoprevention trials with retinoids 26 67 . so far three nr groups have mainly been linked with hnscc the retinoic acid and the peroxisome proliferator activated and the estrogen receptors . likewise data on the cancer related biological functions of orphan nrs are still missing for this tumor entity 7 8 .", "it is activated by endotoxin

undertaken at schools to limit nonnutritious foods and beverages sold on campus and in communities to increase access to nutritious foods and safer places to exercise 8 9 19 . data demonstrating trends in nutrition and exercise counseling by race ethnicity and by insurance type were obtained using four biennial california health interview surveys 20032009 the largest state surveys in the united states . adolescents self reported whether they discussed nutrition or exercise habits with their physician at their last routine exam when you had your last routine physical exam did you and a doctor talk about nutrition or healthy eating and when you had your last routine physical exam did you and a doctor talk about exercise or physical activity data were analyzed using stata version 10 with the svy module to account for weighting and the raking method in variance estimation . the sample consisted primarily of hispanics 49.3 and non hispanic whites 33.5 . counseling appeared to decline from 20032009 among all insurance types although after 2007 a slight increase was observed for the low cost free insurance group . previously reported barriers to counseling include insufficient reimbursement rates lack of time lack of training for medical providers in policy advocacy related to improved nutrition and activity environments and the need for information on evidence based obesity related messages and referral networks for nutrition counseling . when examining nutrition or exercise counseling separately during the study period 20032009 interesting differences were found by race ethnicity hispanic and african american chis adolescents generally reported higher levels of nutrition than exercise counseling while whites generally reported higher levels of exercise than nutrition counseling . given the limited time physicians have in working with patients it is unlikely that any advice given would be in depth psychological advice . research on effective ways to support clinicians use of the aforementioned evidence based obesity related messages is still in its infancy although preliminary data from clinic based obesity interventions have begun to show promising results .", "this study enrolled 41 undergraduate dental students registered in endodontic courses in the 2015 academic year at the college of dentistry taibah university saudi arabia . a questionnaire was distributed to 19 4year and 25 5year students in the final month of the academic year after they had had the maximum amount of training . the questions evaluated self confidence at performing nonsurgical root canal treatment and experiences in this discipline . in dentistry evaluating competence is an important step toward validating the quality of graduating dentists although the relationship between the self confidence and clinical competence of medical students is not fully understood . in another study most of our students described the experience with the first case as okay 78 while 7.4 described it as easy and 14.6 described the first case as difficult possibly because the first case for those students involved a molar or premolar . the number of teeth treated by students in the 4 and 5 year did not meet the recommendations of the european society of endodontology 2001 guidelines which advised that for adequate competency a student should complete root canal treatments in 20 teeth . introducing advances in endodontics into undergraduate training such as niti rotary instruments may improve the clinical experience of students and their self confidence because it will help increase the numbers of cases treated . low self confidence can be ameliorated by increasing clinical exposure which will help students to obtain the necessary skills through

pulp showed better sensitivity than dentin except at 12 months time period where dentin showed better sensitivity than pulp . the use of blood group substances in medico legal examination is grounded on the fact that once a blood group is established in an individual it remains unchanged for a lifetime . this shows that pulp contains more amounts of antigen than the dentin and its antigenicity decreases with time . the presence of abo blood group antigens along with rh factor antigens in pulp and hard dental tissues makes it a potential substance in the identification of highly decomposed

and were selected for the present study . most patients 715 97.9 received milrinone to prevent low cardiac output after cardiac surgeries . based on univariate logistic regression analysis of group a data the following parameters were associated with the development of arrhythmia male gender age 3 months and cardiopulmonary bypass time 180 minutes . most patients in group a with thrombocytopenia required only a few platelet transfusions after cardiac surgeries . the initial infusion rate maintenance continuous infusion rate and duration of milrinone treatment were not associated with thrombocytopenia . in total 41 58.6 of the 70 arrhythmias in group a were classified as junctional ectopic tachycardia whereas the most common arrhythmia identified in group b was ventricular tachycardia . the development of arrhythmia was not influenced by the initial infusion rate maintenance continuous infusion rate or duration of milrinone treatment . finally only a few echocardiographic data including ejection fraction and fractional shortening were used to evaluate milrinone efficacy due to the retrospective study design .", "brown squard syndrome bss which occurs due to dysfunction of the spinothalamic tract typically reflects the hemisection of the spinal cord at the cervical or thoracic level . therefore most management guidelines focus on penetrating cervical injuries andor vertebral artery va injury12 . an immediate interventional angiography was undertaken without general anesthesia due to the nature of the emergency . after the patient was moved to the operating room the electric screw driver bit was removed manually with muscle dissection under general anesthesia . the neurological motor function of the right upper and lower extremities recovered to 35 and 45 respectively with persistent decreased sensory function after one year . therefore penetrating injury of the va is mostly caused by gunshot wounds which deliver large kinetic energy depending upon the bullet s mass and speed12 .", "microperimetry covered the central 12 of the macula therefore only nine scans at the central macula firstly the scan across the central fovea was found and then subsequent four scans in both the superior and inferior directions were picked which covers about 12 of the central macula were selected for further analysis . another six patients were receiving corticosteroids and cyclosporine prescribed at 3 mg kg d and were tapering guided by the severity of ocular inflammation . however 23 of the 30 eyes displaying intact is os junctions displayed fragmented grade 1 3 eyes grade 2 20 eyes cost lines . the is oscost group displayed the best retinal sensitivity and bcva furthermore only this group displayed relatively normal retinal sensitivity table 3 . patients who were using systemic corticosteroids alone or in combination with an immunosuppressant at 12 months had longer durations than those without using versus not using median 30 versus 9 p 0.0001 by the mann whitney u test . clinical findings of late vkh patients vary greatly . oct is routinely used in the diagnosis and follow up of many retinal diseases 913 . however the use of oct to identify retinal morphological changes in late stage vkh patients has not been extensively studied 5 7 8 18 . in addition to defects in the is os junction and thickening of the rpe thinning of onl and a high prevalence 5158 of defects in the cost line were found thereby indicating that oct is useful in the observation of late stage vkh eyes . in accordance with yokota s report of a higher cone density in eyes displaying intact cost lines than in eyes displaying disrupted cost lines our finding supported fujita and itoh s theory that the recovery of the cost line but not the is os junction suggests enhanced restoration of the photoreceptors 11 12 .", "other strategies for increasing the number of proteins identified include prefractionating the proteome based on protein physical properties improving separation of the peptide mixture at the hplc separation step modifying the esi interface to enhance ionization or adding an ion mobility spectrometry faims interface before the ion trap.19 proteome coverage also can be improved at the data analysis stage by using high mass accuracy data20 or improved data process algorithms . it is now well established that repetitive lc ms ms analyses longer hplc gradients or additional fractionation via either more fractions or more modes of separation of complex proteomes will usually confer some benefit in terms of depth of analysis . preparative sds page was run using unfractionated cell lysate and the four microsol ief fractions in an analogous manner to the analytical run except the separation distance was limited to 40 mm to minimize required numbers of fractions and gel volume per fraction . subsequently the final minimum consensus protein lists from the three data sets were compared to evaluate the ability of enhancing sensitivity of repetitive analysis and additional fractionation strategies . hence the total amount of protein in the four gel lanes in figure 3b should be close to the amount of protein in the two lanes in figure 3a provided sample losses during the microsol ief procedure were low as has been previously demonstrated . a total of 25 641 nonredundant peptides were identified after combining all four replicates of the 2d analysis which was 26 less than the 32 216 peptides identified by the 3d method . a majority 135 of these 184 proteins were two peptide proteins in the 2d data indicating that the 3d method identified these proteins by one less peptide . interestingly as we increase the number of fractions per gel lane to 40 or 60 fractions the incremental increases in new proteins identified diminish analogous to the diminishing benefits of adding each additional replicate in the repetitive run approach figure 4a . furthermore more unique peptides were found for most low abundance proteins in the 3d method data compared with the cumulative 2d method data figure 6 . this illustrates that very small variations in identified peptides can have a proportionally higher apparent since we used each unique peptide a single time during assembly of consensus protein lists the common sequences were assigned to the protein with the most unique sequences .", "clinically collies and other related dog breeds have been observed to be more susceptible to the effects of ivermectin on the central nervous system cns . the cyp1a2 enzyme is a member of cytochrome p450 that is encoded by the cyp1a2 gene . single nucleotide polymorphisms snps have been identified as deficiencies in the canine cyp1a2 gene . this study was conducted to gain further insight into the characteristics of a breed or population and identify the snp genetic polymorphisms associated with the three genes mdr1 cyp1a2 and cyp2b11 involved in the metabolism of drugs used for medical treatments in several animals belonging to four different canine breeds . in a manner similar to principal component analysis this method provides a means of displaying or summarising a set of data in three dimensional graphical form . the results allow acquisition of the relative importance inertias of both breeds and alleles . the cimarron population population 1 exhibited a greater genetic distance with respect to the border collie population 2 labrador retriever population 3 and german shepherd population 4 breeds . these haplotypes were compared to those of the control population while those that exhibited frequencies below 1 are included in the rare haplotypes section . snps have been used as markers for diagnoses of specific features that are abundant in the genome genetically stable and easily analysed . it has been proposed that common genetic variants including single nucleotide polymorphisms snps influence the susceptibilities to common disease .", "overcrowding can result in delayed treatment long patient waiting time and stay overburdened working staff patient elopement high medical error rate low productivity and poor patient outcomes . the investigator approached patients attendants presented in the eopd during the data collection hours and asked them about their background characteristics and time of entry in the eopd . the higher use of the ed in the tertiary care hospitals can also be attributed to many reasons such as increase in the illness and chronic diseases changes in demographic and epidemiological trends of diseases increase in acute injuries changes in people s perception about emergency need for health problems better quality of health services rendered and growing population etc . our study depicts that the factors influencing the patient flow do not lie solely in ed although waiting of at least three fourths of all the patients can be explained by the reasons lying in the ed complex itself . similar to our study schull and shanks cited unavailability of alternative levels of care in the community delay in diagnostics and patients held in ed awaiting admission are the main causes of wait in ed . to tackle the random inflow of patients it was recommended that experienced staffing in the ed should be matched with temporal arrival pattern of patients . through this study we tried to analyze the patient flow system by assessing the arrival and waiting time distribution of patients in the emergency out patient department eopd . this study will inform the hospital administrators and policy makers in effectively design a system so as to reduce waiting times and hence overcrowding in ed . why is this topic important the policy makers faces a challenge of overcrowded emergency departments

shaped . multiple sections studied showed cystic breast tumor . scc of the breast is reported to be resistant to both radiotherapy and standard chemotherapy performed for invasive ductal carcinoma . in conclusion the presence of malignant squamous cells in fine needle aspiration of the breast suggests primary scc or metastatic scc .", "of the total patient group 225 began the cbt program during their inpatient stay or immediately upon discharge and 201 89 completed the program . follow up tests revealed no significant differences between groups at admission but the patients who had completed cbt were less depressed m 13.1 than those who never began cbt m 16.6 t611 2.56 p .05 who in turn were not different from those who had dropped out of cbt m 16.9 t516 0.10 p ns . to address the concern that the observed improvement may be due to the general effects of hospitalization rather than the specific effects of cbt the profile of symptom change from admission to pre cbt and then from pre to post cbt was examined . of the variables examined there was no difference in bdi scores between patients from pre to post cbt for whom the depression was a single episode or a recurrent episode f1146 2.37 .02 p ns or for whom the depression was judged to be primary or secondary to another disorder f1151 0.15 .001 p ns . considering those patients for whom depression was the primary disorder there

study examined the effectiveness for patients with depression of a cbt program adapted to an inpatient psychiatric clinic . it is possible that even though comorbid conditions are present the severity or types of comorbidity that may be present in public hospitals e.g. it is possible that the symptom changes that are observed during the cbt program may not be attributable to the program but due to patient selection and other factors associated with hospital care e.g. in addition some concerns in generalizing from efficacy studies to clinical effectiveness that arise due to complexity of patients e.g.", "retinal vein occlusions constitute the second most common cause of retinal vascular disease after diabetic retinopathy with a prevalence of between 1 and 2 in persons older than 40 years of age 25 . rvo can be categorized as branch retinal vein occlusion brvo if the obstruction is located in one of the branches of the central vein or central retinal vein occlusion crvo if it is located in the central vein at the level of the optic nerve . data from the 53 practices participating in the swo database cohort are routinely updated on a quarterly basis with immediate reconciliation at the point of care . moreover there is a correlation between the swo database and national data i.e. please refer to table 3 for data on incidence and type of rvo within the rvo cohort . seventy three patients over 40 years old with a new diagnosis of rvo were identified from 47166 patients over 40 years old . the annual incidence of vi due to me secondary to brvo and crvo was found to be 0.056 95 ci 0.0110.072 and 0.021 95 ci 0.0080.081 respectively . macular edema me is a complication of rvo that can lead to blindness . the incidence of brvo appears generally higher than the incidence of crvo . consistent with previous literature we found that patients with rvo were more likely to present hypertension dyslipidemia or vascular diseases compared with general population 4 1719 .", "it has been well documented in medical literature that diabetes management during ramadan fasting poses challenges to the treating physician and pre ramadan diabetes assessment evaluations and diabetes education are important for successful management.1 this is because unplanned diabetes management during ramadan fasting may lead to hypoglycemia . these include alteration reduction of the dosages for oral hypoglycemic agents ohas and insulins and shifting patients from ohas and insulins to metformin or other agents such as dipeptidyl peptidase4 dpp4 inhibitors . hypoglycemia itself has an adverse effect on the quality of life is an obstacle while managing diabetes to control glycemia and is associated with poor compliance to medication and treatment . dpp4 inhibitors are the new oral antidiabetic agents including vildagliptin sitagliptin saxagliptin linagliptin alogliptin and other agents as well which are under extensive research . under normal physiological state the gut in response to meals releases hormones called incretins for example glp1 glucagon like peptide1 and gip gastric inhibitory polypeptide which augment biosynthesis and secretion of insulin known as incretin effect as well as slow gastric emptying as well.1924 normally these incretin hormones are degraded within minutes after their release by the enzyme dpp4 . in type 1 diabetic subjects there is absolute insulin deficiency due to autoimmunity against cells with destruction of these cells as compared with type 2 diabetic subjects who exhibit relative insulin deficiency with insulin resistance.2526 furthermore absolute or relative hyperglucagonemia due to deficiency of incretin hormones in diabetic state is a hallmark of both type 1 and type 2 diabetic subjects.2728 in other words in type 2 diabetic subjects there is insulin resistance and hyperglucagonemia . however this risk was significantly reduced when vildagliptin was prescribed during ramadan fasting and this has also been recently reported in indo pakistani populations from the uk and in cohorts of uk south asian muslim patients in the vector vildagliptin experience compared to gliclazide observed during ramadan study.4042 furthermore in general these agents have also been demonstrated to be safer in older age group.43 a recent observational study which combined metformin and vildagliptin therapy together with or without ohas during ramadan fasting has demonstrated advantage of reduced hypoglycemia incidence.44 they have shown one case of severe hypoglycemia in the arm treated with oha compared to the vildagliptin group which showed no hypoglycemia event . the hypoglycemia events were 12 times more in the group treated with oha as compared to the vildagliptin group . a recent review published in switzerland and france has studied worldwide the role of dpp4 inhibitors including vildagliptin during ramadan fasting and has come to the conclusion that the anti diabetic agents dpp4 inhibitors could be a more safer option while managing type2 diabetes during ramadan fasting with a very low risk of hypoglycemia.47 another prospective noninterventional study published in france to assess real life rate of hypoglycemia during ramadan fasting in patients with type 2 diabetes and their ongoing dual therapy of metformin vildagliptin or metformin sulfonylurea has shown that hypoglycemia as an adverse events aes was higher in su group as compared to vildagliptin group 17.9 vs 7.5 p0.025 and better compliance was seen with vildagliptin group.48 the virtue vildagliptin experience compared with sulphonylureas observed during ramadan study which recruited 1333 patients from 10 different countries worldwide has demonstrated significantly fewer hypoglycemia

sinusoidal fibrosis is believed to result from an increase in central venous pressure transmitted to hepatic cells that surround the central veins because the extent of cirrhosis is strongly correlated with elevated hepatic venous pressures and a low cardiac index in patients after undergoing the fontan procedure 8 . in addition hepatic complications after the fontan procedure are associated with the duration of follow up 812 . in contrast early stage hccs detected by surveillance can be cured with both surgical resection and liver transplantation 5year disease free survival

specific lesions unique to the perimetrium have not been documented . blood biochemistry showed a mild hyperkalaemia 6.0 mmol l ri 3.75.8 mmol l and mild hypoglycaemia 66 mg dl ri 70150 mg dl . the everted uterus was circumferentially ligated distal to the cervix approximately 5 cm away from the vulva and transected . laxity of the uterine ligaments can occur due to repeated pregnancy and changes in progesterone oestrogen and relaxin concentrations near parturition . based on the absence of any newborn animals no mammary development and no histopathological features to suggest recent pregnancy such as placental zoning recent uterine haemorrhage inflammation and endometrial regeneration it is unlikely this animal was in advanced pregnancy or had aborted . while the uterus was large this latter feature could potentially have contributed to uterine prolapse in at least two ways namely by inducing ligament laxity andor acting as a caudal abdominal irritant inducing abdominal contractions or tenesmus . while an active lesion the extent of mature fibrous tissue would suggest the presence of this lesion in advance of the uterine prolapse . while the cat develops oestrogen associated pathology similar perimetrial pathology has not been documented in association with oestrogen . the unique perimetritis and parametritis observed in this case highlights an additional potential cause of uterine prolapse and warrants that in cases of uterine prolapse in non pregnant animals perimetrial and parametrial tissue should be evaluated for varying degrees of inflammation

osteoclastic bone resorption . the purpose of this study was to clarify the mechanism by which a high p diet affects bone metabolism in older mice . a control diet containing 0.3 p and a high p diet containing 1.2 twenty four 10week old ddy male mice were purchased from slc shizuoka japan and housed individually in stainless cages in a room maintained at 22c with a 12hour light dark cycle . in mice fed the control and high p diets mrna expression of pth receptor rankl trap runx2 osterix alp opn oc and col1a1 was significantly lower in aged mice than in young mice . these results showed that aged mice present a decrease in bone formation and it appears that the balance between bone formation and resorption may be disrupted in aged mice . these results suggest that aging leads to a reduction in osteoblast differentiation and that runx2 and osterix mrna expression changes are associated with a decrease in bone formation in aged mice . demonstrated that plasma 125oh2d duodenal calbindin d protein and ca absorption decreased with age in rats . in this study the high p diet increased serum pth concentration in both young and aged mice and was greater in aged mice than in young mice fed the high p diet . thus a decrease in soluble ca induced by high p diet might lead to trpv6 cabp9k and pmca1b mrna expression and these increases in 125oh2d regulated gene expression seem to compensate for a decrease in ca absorption by the high p diet . furthermore the high p diet affected pth secretion differently in young and aged mice leading to an increase in the rankl opg mrna ratio in aged mice .", "despite advancements in modern medical science and the health management industry the incidence of cerebral palsy cp continues to rise1 . studies indicate that children

assign absolute pressure values to the digital output from an a d converter connected to the sensing pad . then thus subjects sat on one of two school chairs according to their height . for research purposes this study used two basic school chair because students spend a long time of day to day sitting on them . the mann whitney u tests and wilcoxon s signed rank tests were used to analyze

pelvic ectopic kidney are shock wave lithotripsy swl retrograde intrarenal surgery rirs ultrasound or laparoscopy guided pcnl . this was exemplified by our first patient in whom the stone could not be reached with flexible ureteroscope and the procedure had to be abandoned . microperc is a minimally invasive form of pcnl in which percutaneous renal access and stone fragmentation are achieved in a single step using a 16 g needle . since dilatation is not performed potential hazards associated with it are avoided . appropriate patient positioning to move bowel away from the kidney placing a sand bag to push the kidney towards the anterior abdominal wall and compression with the ultrasound transducer allow safe access into the kidney . further the use of colour doppler rules out any significant blood vessel along the path of needle puncture . the patients in that series had sequential removal of nephrostomy tube urethral catheter and abdominal drain which lead to the prolonged post operative stay .", "however several in vitro studies have evaluated post removal with ultrasonic devices by using roots of extract teeth included in resin cylinders . the filled roots were stored in relative humidity for at least 72 h to allow the resin sealer to set . the polyether impression material impregum f 3m espe seefeld germany was mixed and placed in the space created in the resin cylinder . in order to allow tensile testing without the root becoming dislodged the roots included in resin cylinder with spdl were fixed to cylinders with two stainless steel wires about 1 mm in

respiratory virus during the respiratory season of 20062007 in our study . our results confirm the previous findings that children with symptomatic hmpv infection are older than those infected with rsv possibly because of differences in the upper respiratory tract or lung anatomy of older children that allow for hmpv acquisition . in our study although a previous report found that hmpv is a rare cause of community acquired pneumonia among hospitalized patients 4.9 37.5 of our hmpv positive patients were admitted with a diagnosis of pneumonia . the present study demonstrates as previously reported that hmpv positive patients were as likely to be severely ill as were rsv positive patients . lastly we acknowledge the li mi tations associated with the use of different methods for detecting different viruses in our study . our data also suggest that underidentification of children with hmpv may lead to inappropriate use of antibiotics . increasingly hmpv is being recognized as a significant cause of disease in other populations such as elderly patients and immunocompromised cases highlighting other groups that would likely benefit from routine testing for hmpv .", "in

intein as a reactive thioester derivative suitable for chemical ligation . despite the many successes of epl the approach often suffers from low overall efficiency due to complications associated with the generation of protein thioesters . unlike inteins used in standard epl which are contiguous polypeptides that catalyze protein splicing in cis split inteins consist of two discrete polypeptides herein termed int and int which upon association catalyze protein splicing in trans protein trans splicing pts scheme 1 . given the unique properties of split inteins in particular the ultrafast split dnae inteins we conceived the integrated protein modification system shown in figure 1 in which the split intein association is employed both to purify the desired protein from complex biological mixtures and to trigger the generation of a desired protein thioester for epl . in each case cells were lysed and the soluble fraction was loaded onto the int column to allow binding of the npu tagged protein to the immobilized npuaa . twenty ub npu fusion proteins were individually expressed in e. coli and purified over the int column as before . finally we tested our streamlined epl methodology

effects on cardiac or sudden death.7 high levels of plasma 3pufas can decrease the risk of myocardial infarction.8 in terms of stroke low levels of circulating 3pufas in the blood is a risk factor for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.9 a decreased proportion of linoleic acid is also associated with ischemic stroke.10 compared to normal controls stroke patients with moderate to severe intracranial arterial stenosis or occlusion had decreased levels of dha.11 on the other hand a recent meta analysis revealed that the evidence for the beneficial effects of 3pufas is insufficient in adults with peripheral arterial disease associated with poor cardiovascular outcome.12 to date little information is available on the relationship between the composition of fas and prognosis of stroke . patients who had undetermined stroke subtype n45 negative evaluation n19 two or more causes identified or those who had rare causes of stroke subtype n10 such as moyamoya disease arterial dissection or venous

accuracy of codes and categories were discussed and checked in regular sessions discrepancies were resolved through continuing discussion and analysis . the 14 participants consisted of 3 male and 11 female nursing students age 21 23 years in the last semester of their studies . these helped them obtain more realistic knowledge about their personal strengths weaknesses and talents . another significant change reported by students was an increasing maturity of mind that resulted in more rational behavior . another factor that contributed to students social development was existing in a social environment larger than that of high school which involved interaction with a heterogeneous population from various towns ethnic groups and cultures which was regarded as expanding the friends circle by participants i do nt limit myself to making friends with people of my own type i always search for new thoughts and new ideas with their own experiences . others stated they felt closer to god through nursing practice because they were satisfying god s wishes by caring for the most vulnerable . i began taking steps on a road that i was supposed to begin with and i interpreted this as special attention to me on god s part ... i believe that we were summoned by god . in addition participants attributed this commitment to other reasons such as respecting patient s rights and dignity to enjoy humanistic and proper care as a human being responding their inner desire to do their best as a nurse and trying to improve nursing image in society . before i had a child like view of life as a bowl of cherries with no worries but now i know that life has its own hardships which are considered a part of life . through their studies nursing students do not gain expertise in theoretical

that are visible by low magnification microscopy figures 2e and 2f figure s4h . because of the small size of the age dependent stress granule like puncta it was not possible to assess the mobility of tiar2 or pab1 in these structures . we speculated that widespread protein misfolding and aggregation occurring with age could promote sgrbp aggregation . the inherent aggregation propensity of stress granule proteins demonstrates that they are unlikely to be transient interacting partners in pathological aggregates . 2014 . it will be important to investigate by which means endogenous aggregation

how hospitals and health systems operate today and how they might evolve slowly or rapidly toward high reliability in each of these three areas . it is difficult to imagine a hospital getting close to high reliability if quality is merely one of many competing priorities . a culture of safety that fully supports high reliability has three central attributes trust report and improve reason and hobbs

factor here is that the general correlation between objective tests and subjective tests for dry eye is poor.1 this issue is likely due to the multiple etiologies and presentations of ded when particular tests are specific to one etiology then there may be a lack of overall correlation.1 like other diagnostic signs tear osmolarity may not correlate with symptoms in a general population18 although it has been shown to correlate over time with effective therapy as described in the pharmacological effects and treatment section of the present review . certain factors diseases or drugs have been noted to be associated with ded and increased tear osmolarity . one study did not specify the type of artificial tear used and the other did not state the airflow velocity . such differences may account for the conflicting results.2021 in addition the use of less sensitive diagnostic tests may have resulted in the inclusion of some mild dry eye patients in the normal group which would have further confounded results . the literature is divided over whether or not contact lens wear increases22223 or has no effect on tear osmolarity.102425 where osmolarity was measured in some of these studies1024 there was an appropriate delay between contact lens removal and osmolarity measurement . another study found that low levels of 17beta estradiol estrone and testosterone were associated with increased tear osmolarity treatment with phytoestrogen decreased tear osmolarity when compared to a control group.37 more studies in this area appear warranted to further understand the correlation between sex hormones and tear osmolarity adequate control of hydration or measurement of hydration status may be important in such studies . different ocular conditions also seem to have different effects on tear osmolarity table 4 . for instance eyes with pseudoexfoliation syndrome a condition that is thought to alter goblet cell activity and mucin production have been reported to have increased tear osmolarity when compared to a control group.38 patients with pterygia a predominantly inflammatory condition also show increased tear osmolarity when compared with a control group.39 keratoconus has been demonstrated to reduce corneal sensitivity but tear osmolarity was similar to a control group . there were not as many studies graded high or moderate as might be expected in a review of the literature of this type .", "anemia is especially prevalent in patients with cancer and treatment plans often include surgery . ensuring adequate tissue oxygenation in the surgical setting frequently involves the administration of blood transfusions . patients with preoperative hemoglobin levels between 10 and 13 g dl may be three or more times as likely to receive allogeneic blood than those with baseline hemoglobin greater than 14 g dl . longer hospital stays and higher health care costs have also been linked to blood transfusions . taken together these reports indicate that preoperative anemia is prevalent that anemia and blood transfusions are associated with risks and poor outcomes and that anemia should be treated preferably with strategies that exclude allogeneic blood . the human recombinant form of endogenous erythropoietin rhuepo epoetin alfa is indicated for the treatment of anemic patients who are scheduled to undergo elective surgery noncardiac and nonvascular to reduce the need for allogeneic blood transfusions . patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery who received rhuepo 300 units kg per day for 10 days preoperatively on the day of surgery and 4 days postoperatively had a nearly six fold reduction in allogeneic transfusion risk as compared with patients who received placebo . transfusion requirements were reduced and hemoglobin levels were improved with preoperative rhuepo treatment in patients with gastrointestinal tract cancer and in those with rectal cancer undergoing surgery . other patient groups for whom surgery is indicated and in whom preoperative rhuepo exerts beneficial effects include those with prostate cancer head and neck cancer and women undergoing gynecologic surgery for benign conditions . when surgical blood losses are anticipated to exceed 3000 ml rhuepo is effectively used in conjunction with pad .", "each experiment including various treatment groups was performed 3 5 times using

hamamah et al . in the cell it is hydrolyzed by esterases releasing the bcecf which is retained within the cytoplasm . subsequently the fluorescence intensity was measured as described below and the calibration curve was constructed by plotting fluorescence intensity versus extracellular ph 24 . similar experiments carried out with various concentrations 50 400 m of curcumin without sperm did not affect the fluorescence intensity indicating curcumin per se without sperm does not affect fluorescence intensity . the motile sperm in the swim up fraction were centrifuged washed x2 with pbs and

show significant decline in several neurocognitivc domains while women evince no decline . in examining components of domains that show sex differences we find that the verbal memory advantage for women is accounted for primarily by performance on the california verbal learning test cvlt figure 2 whereas the advantage for men in spatial abilities is accounted for by performance on benton s line orientation test . is more impersonal ii some participants particularly the elderly dislike computers or require training and iii tests are not . in a study of facial recognition we reported sex

also in the white matter wm . using the 133xe method we found substantial age related decline in overall cbf values but the pattern of lateralized changes in response to verbal and spatial tasks was identical in young and elderly people . several studies examined emotion processing with functional neuroimaging methods in healthy people . the activation map in figure 7 indicates that the hypothesized left lateralized changes were seen for the verbal task in posterior temporal and inferior parietal regions while right latcralizcd increase was seen for the spatial task in these regions . as is generally the case for age related changes the hormonal environment can have pervasive effects that require scrutiny not only during early development but also during the perimenopausal phase

regulation and summarize current knowledge regarding the presence and functional roles of these inflammatory signal molecules within the respiratory system and their proposed involvement in the expression inflammatory target proteins in response to proinflammatory mediators during airway and lung inflammation . it is highly expressed in inflamed tissues and believed to produce pgs involved in inflammatory processes . pkc activity is also increased in proliferating human airway smooth muscle cells . selected pkcs are activated by lps leading to the production of the proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf il and il6 . activated phagocytic cells generate ros via assembly and activation of the nadph oxidase complex which comprises membrane associated flavocytochrome b558 gp91 and p22 and various cytosolic cofactors p47 p67 and p40 and the gtpase rac1 and mediates transmembrane electron transfer from the major cellular electron donor nadph to reduce molecular o2 to superoxide anion o2 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 . it is therefore understandable that dysregulation of pi3k has been implicated in the induction andor progression of a variety of disease states including those of the respiratory tract ranging from asthma to cancer . moreover we reported that tnf or il1 induces vcam1 and icam1 expression via a c src dependent pathway in human airway smooth muscle cells . in mammals three groups of mapks have been identified the extracellular signal regulated protein kinases erks the c jun nh2terminal kinases jnks and the p38 mapk . therefore mapks play an important role in mediating airway and lung inflammation figure 2 . nfb controls a wide spectrum of biological effects ranging from immune and stress induced responses to cell fate decisions such as proliferation differentiation tumorigenesis apoptosis and tissue remodeling .", "polycystic liver disease is a condition characterized by the presence of multiple cysts in the liver which may be inherited or

"found that ocular dryness affects 20 of wearers of new generation silicone hydrogel contact lenses as well as 24 of wearers of older generation low oxygen permeable phema lenses . in fact it is believed that the use of this product instilled in the lens before insertion would chemically neutralize the biocide effects on the ocular surface helping to alleviate initial and long term discomfort associated to contact lens wear . a slit lamp exam was performed to evaluate conjunctival and corneal staining conjunctival hyperemia and tear break up time tbut . questions of this questionnaire are

were respectively the number one and two reasons identified by subjects to explain this need to withdraw their lenses . consequently we can say that the use of sh drops before insertion helps to address the two major reasons why patients cease to wear contact lens wear discomfort and vision and contributes to a reduction in the physiological impact from contact lens wear . it is easy to realize the impact on wearers practitioners and the contact lens industry if with just one easy additional step before lens insertion it is possible to keep 10 more of the wearers in contact lenses on

anterior chamber does not reform within a short period of time . concerns were raised about possible complications such as secondary angle closure glaucoma and prolonged hypotony . as the wound was completely punched out injected viscoelastic materials in the anterior chamber came out from the wound which made it quite difficult to dry the surface of the cornea for application of tissue adhesive . therefore to provide a necessary support for the gluing amniotic membrane plugging was tried but it was too slippery to be fixed on the wound . a blunt 27gauge needle with a 2mm bent tip attached to a viscoelastic injecter was gently inserted into the anterior chamber through the paracentesis . the technique described in this case appears useful secondary to the minimal residual scarring and related astigmatism . in conclusion application of cyanoacrylate adhesive following iatrogenic incarceration of the iris seems to be simple and effective in managing small paracentral corneal perforations without good apposition .", "the distinction between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder has been justified for many years by reference to family studies showing that these disorders seem to breed true . definitive genetic epidemiological studies of the genetic relationship between autism and these disorders are lacking although there is some evidence for shared genetic factors . first a study of 427 asd cases using approximately 500000 snps identified a 6 mb de novo deletion encompassing nlgn4 and a 270 kb deletion at shank3 . there is also strong evidence implicating some of these genes in schizophrenia although not all of them have been examined . even in non neuronal cell lines it seems that neurexins and neuroligins are necessary for both excitatory and inhibitory synaptogenesis and possibly in functional synapse maturation . further work on the biology of neurexins neuroligins and related proteins is certainly required and it seems likely that the pathogenic roles of these proteins will be illuminated by further human genetic studies . whole genome studies of many thousands of affected individuals are uncovering evidence for genetic overlap between autism

germline brca2 mutations . these observations raise the possibility that the nature of brca2 mutations their timing or their coincidence with alterations with tp53 may alter the histopathological evolution of pancreatic cancers in mice . these findings exemplify how the new generation of gemms for pdac may represent valuable surrogate models for preclinical tests of therapeutic efficacy in patients . one potential advantage of such gemms is that unlike human trials they will allow sequential sampling of appropriate tumour tissues to assess the pharmacodynamic impact of a particular

arginine tail to enhance cell permeability . alkylating agents act through dna damaging mechanisms and are commonly used in cancer therapy . peptoids have recently been exploited as multivalent platforms to design conjugates capable of targeting different nucleic acids and protein receptors . ar coactivator recruitment assays revealed that conjugate 6 did not promote binding between ar and coactivator proteins while conjugate 7 partially recruited coactivator proteins . intriguingly conjugate 6 and 7 share extensive chemical similarities indicating that the disposition of the ligand presentation on the scaffolds can exert a significant influence on the mechanism of action . nonsteroidal bivalent conjugates that induce agonistic and antagonistic er conformations figure 10 were

without active bleeding within a minute mucosal defect or through normal surrounding mucosa or 3 a fresh densely adherent clot with a narrow point of attachment to a minute mucosal defect or to normal appearing mucosa.7 although endoscopic features could not be proven to be a true dieulafoy lesion by the historical criteria mentioned above the endoscopic finding remains convincing for dieulafoy

the contexts they inhabit and the opportunities available to them in seeking wellness happiness and a full life . physicians believed they were largely unsuccessful in treating obesity but attributed this to patient noncompliance and lack of motivation which coincides with their general view of overweight and obese individuals as lazy . these portrayals may inadvertently silence the source most important to understanding the public health programming needs of obese individuals that is obese individuals themselves by presenting a homogenizing and blaming view of such individuals lifestyles and experiences . while environmental risks for obesity are acknowledged individuals are assumed to willingly incur these risks and thus still be largely culpable for their body size and worthy of disapprobation . rather than castigating obese individuals for their size qualitative social science researchers may be in a position to rewrite common stereotypical assumptions of obese individuals lives by working collaboratively to better understand the health and experiences of an often maligned group and addressing the health concerns most relevant to them . this deterioration of social support may be an unacknowledged mechanism through which weight stigma affects health which may previously have been erroneously attributed to the weight itself . to cope with stigmatizing environments being aware of the everyday effects of stigma on individuals lives lifestyles and health is an essential factor in planning salutogenic engaging beneficial and inclusive public health strategies . the literature thus suggests that obese individuals experience substantial stigmatization and exist in an environment saturated with nonproblematized information concerning the health risks of excess weight . a variety of issues have been raised by these scholars and include the use of terms such as epidemic or crisis in referring to obesity the moralization of a presumed health issue and resultant ethical and stigmatizing implications of interventions and messaging and the dominant obesity discourse s effects on individuals bodily understandings 2 32 3648 5658 6268 . further

progressive nature of the disease and how it overwhelms available therapies was highlighted in the ukpds study suggesting that fewer than half of all patients actually achieve adequate levels of disease control.45 there is a recognized need for new treatment options for t2 dm . glucose concentration in the glomerular filtrate reflects plasma concentration . renal micropuncture studies conducted with phlorizin in the 1970s showed that the transporter was located in the brush border of the proximal tubule and that sodium was required for the renal absorption of glucose.111920 studies performed since then confirmed that phlorizin is a competitive inhibitor of glucose transport with a binding affinity for the transporter that is 1000 to 3000fold greater than that of glucose.21 the rabbit homolog of the human type 1 sodium glucose transporter sglt1 which is coded by the slc5a gene was the first mammalian cotransporter carrier protein to be identified cloned and sequenced.22 a family of slc5a gene sodium dependent transporters has since been sequenced and identified in a broad range of tissues.2324 sglt1 and sglt2 are perhaps the slc5a family members that have received greatest coverage within the literature . to address this possible limitation to therapeutic utility candidate sglt2 inhibitors both the o and c glucosides appear to bind to a single site on the sglt2 transporter . in effect glucose removal might be expected only to be greatest at times when it is most needed when glucose levels are highest such as during post prandial hyperglycemia . nevertheless patients who achieve moderate glycemic control may be exposed to clinically relevant post prandial glucose excursions that can impart disproportionate effects on hba1c and possibly the morbidity and mortality associated with t2dm.56 in such a patient population sglt2 inhibitors might attenuate the impact of post prandial glucose spikes . there have been some reports of infection in clinical studies.6061 however a study that reviewed risk factors for developing utis in women with diabetes observed that glucosuria was not a significant contributing factor.62 interestingly there is a rare group of individuals who do not express the sglt2 transporter or in which its functionality has been partially or completely lost due to a genetic mutation for which both an autosomal recessive and dominant pattern of inheritance has been reported . increased glucose content in the urine following sglt2 inhibition will likely serve to increase urinary flow as a consequence of the osmotic diuretic effect in the lumen of the nephron . the question arises as to where sglt2 inhibitors might fit in the current cascade of treatments for the management of t2 dm . the insulin independent action of sglt2 inhibitors also means that they may be of use in type 1 diabetes perhaps as a means of moderating post prandial glucose excursions .", "one thousand and seventy seven patients were

quality of life hrqol are able to offset the possibly higher costs of hdf and thus whether it is worth investing in this more innovative therapy . . few studies addressed the qol evaluation and none provided hrqol coefficients for the specific comparison of hf hd and hdf fundamental for the purpose of this analysis . consequently the quality and quantity of information available can be reflected in the probability distributions assigned to each input parameter in the model.20 several monte carlo simulations were performed also for patients with different risk profiles by age patients aged 40 50 and 60 years sex and diabetic status.2122 for the sake of simplicity the cohort of simulated 50year old male patients were selected as the reference population for the analysis . the probability of cost effectiveness increased to 50 with a threshold of 7000qaly to 70 with a threshold of 15000qaly and to 81 with the commonly accepted threshold of 40000qaly . this message is reinforced in figure 4 which shows that a given threshold value is associated to a higher probability of hdf being cost effective for the 40 and 50year old patients than for the 60year old ones . by applying a 0 or a 5 discount rate for both costs and effects 50year old male patient icer decreased to 6676qaly and increased to 6960qaly respectively confirming the robustness of the estimations . given the commonly accepted threshold of 40000qaly this study demonstrated that compared to hf hd hdf is a cost effective treatment for patients on dialysis . however it has to be mentioned that the same analysis performed on patients treated in montreal canada according to the same protocol yielded different positive results.24 our analysis on the other hand reports that hdf is cost effective with a

act as a mechanism of resistance to chemotherapy 110115 . further investigation is nevertheless necessary to clarify whether this mechanism participates in the activation of autophagy in response to er stress . a wide array of conventional and experimental chemotherapeutic agents has been shown to stimulate er stress and activation of upr along with autophagy in cancer cells . these observations

explanation may be that our study population presents a high predominance of the male gender being more frequently affected by primary htn suggesting that bevacizumab related htn may present the same

we can regard them logically as agents in this system . when we study a cas the focus is on the interaction and communication between agents . complexity science emphasizes the inherent power of development and self organizing nature of the system . one important aspect of complexity science is that it has shown how complementary knowledge organizes for co operation . positive feedback loops enhance or amplify changes and tend to move a system away from equilibrium stage . communication and co ordination conflicts among participating agents or rather free riding agents have been noted .", "biological merit of post translational processing and modifications of proteins are possible considerations . as figure 4a shows using immunodouble gold particle staining cathepsin b small gold particle and cathepsin h large gold particle are located clearly in different lysosomes . cathepsin l is translated as 17 amino acids of prepart 96 amino acids of pro part and 221 amino acids of mature part 9 10 . the prepart is removed cotranslationally and formed procathepsin is translocated into golgi apparatus and then the 108asn and the 155asn in mature parts are glycosylated by high mannose type sugar as shown in figure 2a . the initiations of degradation of cathepsins are started from the ordered limited proteolysis by cysteine protease in the lysosomes as figure 2 shows . the formed hydrophobic products were translocated into autophagosome or proteasome after ubiquitinated to degrade to amino acids . as pit formation test in table 4 shows bone matrix degradation is catalyzed by cathepsin l but not by cathepsin b. endogenous low molecular weight cathepsin inhibitors are consisted of two big groups one is only located in skin and the other is ubiquitously located

initially it was suggested that decrease in naa represented neuronal loss 18 however a reversible decrease in naa has recently been shown to occur for acute lesions in multiple sclerosis and in stroke like episodes of melas 19 . 21 has pointed out that the above mentioned studies regarding h mrs and outcome after stroke measured the naa loss from the center of infarcted region and thus these naa losses were not representative of the total neuronal injury . the biochemical information obtained during the present study shows that the m1 naa cr ratios are significantly decreased in the ah for intracerebral hematoma which induces axonal injury to the internal capsule . 3 the subjects were those who had already had shown good recovery of their motor function after neural injury but we enrolled subjects who had not recovered from hemiparesis . nevertheless no correlation was found between the naa cr values in the affected m1 and the severity of leg weakness . we found that the m1 in the ah has lower naa cr values than in the m1 in the uh and in normal volunteers . though we can not precisely document the exact meaning of these lower naa cr ratios a presumed retrograde

network . as more community hospitals including the kaiser hospital physicians home care agencies and other providers became involved with aids care informal approaches to case coordination became much more difficult . kaiser permanente the largest health maintenance organization in the region currently enrolls nearly one third of pwa s in san francisco . as at sfgh case management attention

cardiovascular complications . adipose tissue is a key regulator of energy balance playing an active role in lipid storage and buffering synthesizing and secreting a wide range of endocrine products into circulating blood that influence systemic metabolism . thus the lipogenic pathway has been suggested to be downregulated in obesity at least at the gene expression level . the activation of ppar leads to adipocyte differentiation and fatty acid storage whilst it represses genes that induce lipolysis and the release of free fatty acids ffa in adipocytes . this suggests that ror1 may be added to the list of nuclear receptors in adipose tissue that could be used to modulate the ir associated with obesity . thus taking together the increased expression of the brca1 gene and the reduced expression of many lipogenic factors could be interpreted as the process through which cells reduce their ability to synthesize additional fatty acids once the limit in the storage capacity of the adipocytes is attained . thus the ability of adipose tissue to expand and match the storage needs of energy surplus may be a key determinant in protection against the metabolic syndrome associated with obesity . vegf has also been recognized as being a potent stimulator of endothelial proliferation and migration moreover it has been noticed that its signaling is needed for an adequate adipose tissue function . sfrp1 and spot14 are two genes influenced by the weight gain involved in adipogenesis and whose overexpression protects from metabolic disturbances . obesity increases the risk for t2d through induction of insulin resistance and the link has been established with many factors such as inflammation mitochondrial dysfunction hyperinsulinemia and lipotoxicity but there is not a

force in each group . in contrast for the group of elderly females the hip extension moment was related to the first peak of the vertical ground reaction force and the ankle plantarflexor moment was related to the second peak of vertical ground reaction force . the first peak and the minimum value at mid stance of the vertical ground reaction force were not significantly different between the elderly and the young . the plantar flexion moment of the ankle of the elderly was smaller by approximately 14.5 percent than that of the young people . in our previous study16 the knee extension moment during late stance was associated with the anterior component of the ground reaction force of young males and the knee joint moment was associated with the antero posterior component of the ground reaction force of young females . the changes in physical function with aging are not equal in males and females30 and physical characteristics lifestyle and social background are different between males and females .", "the kb builder framework enabled setting up a web accessible knowledge base and the analysis workflows . we selected 10 proteins from uniprot that have detailed

of primary importance because it accounts for about 90 of fatalities . once in the liver amanitins are transported by a nonspecific transport system into hepatocytes producing an extensive centrolobular necrosis 4 10 . the clinical picture due to amanita phalloides poisoning can range from a mild subclinical presentation to a lethal fulminant course . in the last phase the transaminases rise dramatically and liver and renal function deteriorate resulting in hyperbilirubinemia coagulopathy hypoglycemia acidosis hepatic encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome . in contrast in those patients with a favourable outcome a rapid improvement in liver function tests occurs followed by a full recovery and restoration of a normal quality of life . the first task is to link the clinical presentation with mushroom ingestion as the association may be obscured by the delay between symptom onset and the mushroom meal . the clinical efficacy of any modality of treatment for amatoxin poisoning is difficult to demonstrate since randomized controlled clinical trials have not been reported . although the real efficacy of this method or that of the other liver support systems should be analyzed in appropriate trials their use may represent a potential additional option to treat patients with severe amanitina poisoning . however it is generally accepted that extracorporeal decontamination treatment is useful only if started very early soon after the gastrointestinal symptoms occur . the suggested dosage is 150 mg kg over 15 min intravenously followed by 50 mg kg over 4

and type iv anatomy in patients with severe conduction disturbance.34 although there are several studies supporting the causal relationship of conduction disturbances and underlying coronary anatomy this association is not clear particularly from the view of avb reversibility . coronary artery disease was determined on the result of cag coronary ct angiography and myocardial single photon emission computerized tomography spect . in the ib group 129 74.6 had no cad on admission 40 23.1 had stable angina 2 1.2 presented with unstable angina and 2 1.2 presented with acute myocardial

is reversible in patients with cad . thus our study result supports the association of avb and underlying cad which compromise the blood flow to septal branch or the rca . our results show that avb in patients with ami is usually reversible after revascularization treatment while patients with avb without ami usually required implantation of a permanent pacemaker irrespective of the presence of cad .", "crp is a member of the class of acute phase reactants as its levels rise dramatically during inflammatory processes occurring in the body . weight in kilograms and height h in meters using the formula bmi kg m mh h . bmi is a reliable indicator for estimation of body fat wherein a high bmi value usually indicates high levels of body fat and vice versa . it is based on the principle of measurement of antigen antibody reaction by end point method using turbidimetric immunoassay . the study and control groups were similar in terms of anthropometric parameters such as age height weight and bmi table 1 . similar observation holds true when we analyze the crp levels in male and female patients separately . the difference in the study and control groups was significant at p 0.001 i.e. highly significant . serum leptin levels were significantly higher in the study group 1.44 0.72 ng ml compared to that in the control group 0.68 0.55 ng ml . the above results indicate that serum

controller . in this paper we focus on neural control of horizontal monkey saccades . table 1 summarizes the activities in initiating controlling and terminating the burst firing through the neural network generating a saccade in the right eye . we introduce a neural circuit model that can be parameterized to match the described firing characteristics of each type of neuron . this is modeled by excitatory or inhibitory pulse train stimuli to stimulate the dendrite of the postsynaptic neuron more realistically . figure 8 shows a number of action potentials and the synaptic current pulses of

where nant denotes the antagonist neural innervation input and the fant is the antagonist active state tension generated . as described the number of active neurons impacts the control of saccades instead of the variations in the firing rate of those neurons under the time optimal control strategy . the parameterized saccadic oculomotor plant for the trend of changes in muscle tensions involved in each saccade is such that neuron data derived active state tensions drive the muscle fiber oculomotor plant . the trajectory of variation in the agonist pulse magnitude among these saccades is consistent with the agonist pulse magnitude saccade magnitude characteristic for the large saccades refer to figure 1.25a in .", "a male caucasian patient born in 1977 presented in september 2005 with

the market as tobacco harm reduction products and they may have a unique role in this field . they work by evaporating a nicotine containing liquid which is subsequently inhaled by the user . in conclusion we presented a case of a young smoker having cin and low grade inflammation which was reversed after smoking cessation . the daily use of electronic cigarettes did not hinder the beneficial effects of smoking cessation in this patient .", "thus this study aimed to investigate clinical imaging and procedural factors predictive of good outcome and mortality after stent retriever

modification systems preventing phage proliferation by bacteriophage exclusion and even committing altruistic suicide by abortive infection systems to prevent viruses to spread in a population . in the many hundreds of articles since published detailed molecular understanding of the crispr cas systems have been generated how the system learns to recognize new viruses which the components of the systems are and how they are produced how the virus is recognized and destroyed what countermeasures the viruses use and which non immunity processes crispr cas components participate in . the diversity of the system is explored and today there are 6 basic types described along with numerous subtypes . the mobility also means that prevalence is not a good indicator of importance as crispr cas systems can be regarded as selfish genetic elements . further a recent investigation of uncultured microorganisms headed by jillian banfield indicate that in some major bacterial lineages only 10 contain crispr cas systems . in the case of the acid mine drainage viral community early experiment on the role of crispr cas in virus host interaction in laboratory settings was published in 2013 using the bacterial dairy workhorse streptococcus thermophilus and its d2972 phage . another study on the same species demonstrated that in addition to the expected competition between crispr cas immunity and phage escape mutants there were some unanticipated results phages could establish themselves in a culture containing one but not 2 spacers targeting it bacteria without crispr cas immunity persist in cultures despite presence of a large amount of phage and bacteria with 2 spacers targeting a phage could still not establish themselves in a population of phage sensitive bacteria . a key question for understanding the dynamics of virus defense is the relative importance of different anti virus mechanisms . phages readily evolved escape mutants and established themselves in single strain cultures but found life increasingly difficult the more diversity there was in the culture and in mixtures of 2448 strains the phages quickly became extinct . the ability of a population with high diversity in crispr cas immunity to successful protect themselves from viral escape mutants may be a selection pressure driving the evolution of other anti crispr strategies .", "the

30 to 60 min after stimulation . in the non responder group two patients of this group patients 3 and 4 showed peak levels at a time of 30 min . comparative studies between the effects of somatostatin and da agonists on the release of gh in acromegaly have given conflicting results i.e. in the therapeutic aspect of the newly developed somatostatin analog sms 201 995 this drug has suppressed gh levels for several hours without any rebound hypersecretion of gh . therefore we investigated the gh secretory patterns to various stimuli and to circadian rhythm in a group of 4 responders to sms 201 995 and a group of 4 non responders . these patients might be considered to have normal or increased somatostatin levels and excessive secretion of ghrh might be the primary event .", "the glycocalyx also modulates the inflammatory response by preventing leukocyte adhesion and binding numerous ligands including chemokines cytokines and growth factors 4 6 . negatively charged and with a mesh like structure the endothelial glycocalyx is comprised of glycoproteins proteoglycans glycosaminoglycans gags and associated plasma proteins including albumin . hyaluronan a nonsulphated uncharged gag with water retaining properties is attached or adsorbed onto other cell surface anchored proteins for example cd44 and helps to stabilise the glycocalyx structure . it is now accepted that tnf oxidised lipoproteins lipopolysaccharide thrombin ischaemia reperfusion hyperglycaemia and growth factors all cause glycocalyx disruption via the action of proteases leading either to partial degradation with release of gag side chains or to more severe damage characterised by shedding of core proteins . several studies have evaluated circulating levels of syndecan1 and gags in patients with sepsis 10 13 . however drugs that might specifically increase the synthesis of glycocalyx components refurbish the glycocalyx or selectively prevent protease degradation are not currently available . future endeavours in the field of sepsis research which are urgently required should not only include components of the endothelial glycocalyx in the list of biomarkers but also consider their potential as therapeutic targets for the development of new therapies .", "ar inhibitors are being studied as potential therapeutic agents for use in treating diabetic complications 3 4 . increased oxidative

briefly cells were seeded into 6well plate 3 10 cells well incubated at 37c for 1 hour in the presence of 5 m r123 washed twice with pbs and placed in fresh complete medium containing 150 m diclofenac . after different times of drug treatment the medium was withdrawn and collected cells were washed twice with pbs . these data indicate that cytochrome c is released from the mitochondria as a consequence of the diclofenac treatment of sh sy5y cells . indeed we present evidence that diclofenac induces apoptosis through a modulation of the mitochondrial function associated to an alteration of the redox homeostasis . indeed several data showed that ros mainly produced by mitochondria are involved in the programmed cell death through an induction of the oxidative stress . also in our neuronal cell system diclofenac provokes an early and significant increase of the intracellular ros levels . therefore an efficient sod2 activity is required to counteract the mitochondrial dysfunction induced by an oxidative stress which could lead to the programmed cell death usually observed in various disease contexts . in particular this process is associated to a significant and concomitant reduction of both protein level and enzymatic activity of sod2 whereas rt pcr experiments showed that the corresponding mrna levels are not affected by the diclofenac treatment . this result confirms the involvement of sod2 in the apoptotic processes induced by the drug and suggests that an archaeal thioredoxin is active also in human cells .", "there are no reports of illnesses

the many types of paraganglioma an exclusively dopamine producing type is extremely rare . because of the abnormal catecholamine synthesis pathway the levels of dopamine and its end product homovanillic acid hva are increased whereas the levels of norepinephrine epinephrine and their end product vma are decreased . there is an absence of hemodynamic changes or so called paroxysmal symptoms that are usually found in patients with catecholamine secreting pheochromocytoma . these two effects could explain the pre operative hypotension in dopamine secreting tumor patients . in

erk12 is required for human islet apoptosis in response to chronic exposure to high glucose concentrations or interleukin1 . the mechanisms underlying apoptosis are regulated by defined biochemical pathways involving members of the bcl2 family .", "inferring a bonafide relationship between changes in the level of a given mrna molecule level with the change in the biological response under study requires providing evidence that the observed variation is explained mainly by the biological factor and not by a confounding event . a large quantity of rna was extracted from the liver of the mice from the 3 different treatments . the score plots for the 5 laboratory data sets presented in figure 4 showed that the biological variability seems to be conserved across the 5 measurement sets . altogether these initial explorations allowed for the conclusion that the rna molecules quantified in this study were not degraded and were suitable for subsequent correlation studies . the normalization s scope is to prevent artifactual shift in the mrna level matrix brought in by some inherent technical variability eg with the optical instrument of the affymetrix scanner . following this test on 1 laboratory data set the exact same comparison under the exact same data analyses procedure table 1 shows the top 20 lower q value affymetrix probe set elements for the 3 of the 5 laboratory data sets . while the plots of the figure 4 show that the 5 data sets contained biologically meaningful informational contents the plots in figures 5 and 6 and results in table 1 indicate that any post rna extraction manipulations potentially modify the original rna composition . the remaining changes in the rna composition are due to the effect of the rna labeling procedure . as more than 1 high throughput method has been devised since the early days of dna microarrays almost 20 years ago legitimate concerns were raised as to the relevance of comparing 1 data set acquired from 1 method eg affymetrix genechip with another method eg agilent microarray . a matter of concern lies in the inference procedure used with gsea results in some instances authors would assign the gene ontology class returned by the gsea query to all the elements of the query list .", "this study was conducted to investigate the following hypotheses and questions 1 does cold gel pack reduce the pain associated with deep breathing and coughing db and c after cardiac surgery 2 what sensations do patients have during the application of cold gel packs over sternal incision dressing 3 do patients undergoing open heart surgery prefer cold therapy prior to db and c this study was a randomized controlled trial rct with crossover design which was conducted in the cardiac surgery intensive care unit icu at a university affiliated hospital in urmia iran . all patients performed four episodes of dbandc two with cold gel pack and two without it every 2 h. the seqence of gel pack application was randomized so that half of the patients were given gel pack for 15 min followed by a period of no treatment so called washout period and then they were not given gel pack . patients were asked to rate the severity of their pain using a horizontal scale that was numbered from 0 absence of pain to 10 the most intense pain possible . this five part form consisted of 1 demographic information part stating their age sex level of education marital status religion and employment 2 general information part stating their height weight body temperature and the amount of hemoglobin 3 present history

cold therapy is one of the nonpharmacologic methods that they can easily use .", "coronal maximum intensity projection from mra reveals occlusion of the right vertebral artery which is likely due to artery dissection magnetic resonance imaging mri . when gabapentin was titrated up to 600 mg t.i.d the pain was finally controlled . it is widely accepted that the commonest cause of tn is compression of the trigeminal root entry zone by a blood vessel . in 2004 peker et al . mri showed an acute pontine infarction just at the root entry zone of the right trigeminal nerve . the pathogenesis of tn secondary to a brainstem ischemic lesion is uncertain . the latency between the stroke and pain onset ranged between 1 month and 2 years . facial pain was always ipsilateral to the infarction and was mostly localized in the periorbital region . these patients reported short pain attacks lasting seconds to minutes and three of them also had persistent pain . our patient also had neuralgiform pain attacks in association with a wallenberg s syndrome .", "anova was used wherever needed . about one fourth 19 24.38 of our patients had both renal and skeletal manifestations . the mean serum ipth

the surgical success cure for phpt is defined by the maintenance of eucalcemia at the arbitrarily accepted interval of 6 months after surgery . the improvement in vitamin d nutrition is reflected by the mean serum 25ohd of 37.2 ng ml in our patients . we found a strong correlation of parathyroid gland weight with serum calcium and ipth as has been reported previously . in our series the sensitivity of usg and tc sestamibi scan for localization of adenoma was 89.8 and 95.3 respectively . in conclusion our study reflects a changing trend in the clinical profile of phpt in india .", "these increased levels of dna damage are also corroborated by decrease in the dna repair capacity of specific enzymes such as 8oxodg dna glycosylase1 ogg1 . in addition increased levels of oxidative damage to dna and rna bases have been consistent with the neurodegenerative conditions like pd ad and als . together these evidences comprehensively indicate that reduced antioxidant potential might be a critical factor toward increased oxidative stress that is associated with neurodegenerative disorders . moreover dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra the most affected brain region by pd are particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress . immunocytochemical analysis of 8oxodg revealed a significant increase of this dna oxidation marker in the substantia nigra of patients with pd although the extent of nuclear 8oxodg accumulation is not as high as mitochondrial 8oxodg . despite the presence of 8oxodg specific dna repair enzyme ogg1 a significant percentage of this dna lesion remains unrepaired and accumulated under disease conditions . in this study it has been shown that 8oxodg can mispair with adenine instead of cytosine through a hoogsteen base paring with the 8oxodg lesion at the polymerase active center thereby escaping the proofreading of the polymerase and maintained in the nascent rna stand . among tm generated syn mutants the following mutants a30e h50n and a53e have mutations at the same amino acid position as the familial forms of mutants a30p h50q and both a53e and a53 t respectively . the majority of idiopathic pd cases are a late onset sporadic form with cytoplasmic syn aggregates which indicates that increasing degree of aggregation does not depend only on genetic mutations in snca . however till date the approaches to understand the molecular mechanism of syn aggregation have focused primarily on the biochemical properties of mutant protein species that were identified in rare familial form of pd and their behavior within the cells .",

reviewed the literature to suggest the best treatment for a successful pregnancy outcome . selective reduction of the cervically located gestational sac was planned with readiness for hysterectomy . the postoperative course was uneventful with a postoperative hemoglobin level of 11.3 g dl . therefore we reviewed the literature to identify the best treatment of heterotopic cervical pregnancy for a successful pregnancy outcome . in the 30 cases in which preserving the iup was attempted the attempt was successful in 25 cases 24 were live births but one case was followed up to 12 weeks of

generally recovers rapidly.48 each retrosplenium receives major inputs from the contralateral retrosplenium the orbital and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex the anterior cingulate cortex parahippocampal cortex superior temporal sulcus precuneus claustrum and the anterior and lateral thalamic nuclei.9 therefore a good prognosis may be partly due to functional substitution of the counterpart

control over the fertilization process to pick sperms from a particular male of their choice . the drosophilidae has great variation in sperm length ranging from 300 m to 6 cm . it was suggested that inside the thin tubular seminal receptacle sperm from different males are mixed and compete with each other for a chance to reach the ovulated egg and that a longer tail is helpful to position the sperm head closer to the exit from the seminal receptacle . we propose that double membrane architecture of mitochondria combined with cytoplasmic microtubules can serve as structural support for sustainable elongation of the sperm tail . another double membrane organelle nucleus showing similar morphological diversification in sperm across species is also likely serving as an alternative shaping tool for sperm morphogenesis . many of which are suggested to be related to their tissue specific functions . intriguing questions are whether the conversion of microtubule motor complex from mitochondrial trafficking and mitochondria dependent microtubule nucleation are general mechanisms required for morphogenesis of mitochondria in other type of cells such as the ordered arrays within muscle fibers of muscle cells and the elongated forms in photoreceptor cells of human retina . having outlined the process of sperm tail elongation we are in the position of starting a comparative analysis of spermatid elongation in drosophila melanogaster strains with long and short sperm . also large mitochondria are the most frequent feature of sperms among insects and arthropods . moreover

and cover a wide range of molecular weights . the compromised functions of some of these genes have been linked to the clinical symptoms of dm1 e.g. the binding of the multifunctional helicases p68

while it was almost absent on the parental hek293 cells figure 1a panel a . when dkk1 cm was supplemented with 100 m nci8642 the binding of dkk1 figure 1a panel d was reduced compared to the dmso treated control figure 1a panel c . nci8642 was also tested in an assay measuring the modulation of catenin intracellular accumulation and nuclear translocation . our study confirmed that nci8642 acts as a dkk1 inhibitor and we extended the finding to the interaction of dkk1 to lrp6 . spr technology also showed that nci8642 interacts with the immobilized lrp6 with a reproducible and concentration dependent binding in the absence of dkk1 kd 4.7 10 m . in the tcf luc assay we observed a slight increase of the wnt3a mediated activation of the reporter gene even in the absence of dkk1 .", "these interventions improve overall communication abilities but questions have been asked whether they contribute to the recovery of language function or whether they actually contribute to a learned non use phenomenon . fourteen subjects were randomized to receive ciat 34 participants per group 4 groups were assembled and 10 to receive no intervention figure 1 . to enhance the chance for successful implementation of cues during the ciat sessions clinicians maintained a cuing tracking form that described the interaction between another clinician and their participant partners . after randomization sealed study charts containing all pre intervention testing results nat were funneled through the study biostatistician cjl to the therapists . one patient did not complete the 12 week visit or testing and 7 additional patients were missing at least 1 nat score . the primary analysis used independent samples t tests to examine the differences in nat scores at each time point between the intervention and control groups and effect sizes and 95 confidence intervals the secondary analysis was an ad hoc analysis comparing the characteristics of patients who demonstrated a response or change in nat scores to patients who did not . specifically differences were observed in subjective communication abilities assessed with the mini cal . patients who received ciat scored higher on the

inability to walk or bear weight on his left lower limb after he spontaneously dislocated his patella while running on uneven ground . we would recommend that in the settings of patella being vertically dislocated and locked open reduction would be the management of choice as these types of dislocations are difficult to relocate by closed reduction . he was given a full length leg cast for 1 month after which he was able to resume his daily activities without any difficulty . standard anteroposterior and lateral plain radiographs were taken which showed a laterally displaced and vertically rotated patella along its long axis with the medial patellar edge locked and dipping into the lateral gutter fig . the stability and tracking of the patella was checked and it showed a tight lateral retinaculum along with a lax medial retinaculum . quadriceps setting exercises and active straight leg raising were started in the second post operative week . in this report we review a case of lateral dislocation of patella which is of interest in that it was vertically rotated locked dislocation of patella which was atraumatic i.e with no direct trauma to the patella in an individual with a history of recurrent dislocation of patella . only a handful of cases have been reported in literature in whom there was no history of direct trauma . this case report is rare in the sense that there was no history of direct trauma preceding the dislocation and the mode of dislocation was running over uneven surface . open reduction not only yields better outcomes but also allows the surgeon to perform patellar realignment procedures in order to prevent further patellar dislocations in a setting of prior patellar instability .", "taken together these findings suggest that iad

disease . all interventions were completed in a supine position on a massage table with a pillow placed under the knees to relax the lower back muscles . eeg data were acquired for 5 min before and immediately following mld . after data acquisition and storage all statistics were computed to extract asymmetry values for the alpha frequency band in the frontal area of the cerebral cortex192021 . the measurement of alpha asymmetry has been shown to be effective and reliable in discriminating positive and negative emotions23 29 . since previous investigations have demonstrated a relationship between brain electrophysiology in the frontal area and measures of affective states19 20 30 31 we have also focused our analysis on the three anterior electrode pairs fp1fp2 f3f4 and f7f8 . our

corresponding to the ridges on the nail plate figures 2b d . a distal longitudinal section figure 4a and b showed a different pattern of the tumor glove finger like monodigitate pattern with marked papillomatosis and multiple thick and deep epithelial ridges . on proximal transverse sections a lobulated foliated pattern is observed while a glove finger monodigitate pattern is observed on longitudinal distal sections . the stroma contains several mast cells and is arranged in two layers a superficial cellular vascular layer with fibrillary collagen and a deeper relatively less cellular layer with dense collagen bundles . all of these are easily distinguishable by histopathology except fibrokeratoma fibroma and saf which need more careful differentiation . the stroma of om may resemble a fibroma which can however be excluded by the hyperplastic and onychogenic epithelium of om . in conclusion onychomatricoma is a rare fibroepithelial tumor mostly arising from the nail matrix . histopathological patterns of onychomatricoma vary in proximal and distal sections foliated pattern on proximal transverse sections and a glove finger like pattern on the distal longitudinal

under construction to provide power for the port in santos then the largest exporter of coffee . during prowazek and giemsa s sojourn at the instituto oswaldo cruz the institution was also visited by ernst rodenwaldt an army physician also connected to hamburg s institute for maritime and tropical diseases . scientific relations between brazil and germany in the field of tropical medicine were very dynamic with knowledge and innovations being produced on both sides . at the time of the war few german doctors were familiar with the clinical aspects of malaria and how to treat and prevent it because according to rodenwaldt having been eliminated from germany half a century ago except for small enclaves malaria was no more than a curiosity in medical teaching before the war. the fact is that the parasite s or human organism s resistance to quinine involved complex issues that were beyond the grasp of medical science at the time . i have reached the idea of parasite races that are resistant to quinine by practical means in a severely affected population which received an unreliable supply of the alkaloid with the process observed not being due to developed and inherited resistance but rather to selection and increased virulence especially in more lethal and resistant parasite strains . according to neiva one of the factors that exacerbated malaria amongst these population groups was the incorrect use of quinine which was sold mainly in the form of a sulphate that was effective neither for prevention nor for treatment . a publication from the following year shows that he saw resistance differently from neiva and rodenwaldt which suggests that the latters hypotheses had not left the theoretical realm my personal views on the matter have always been that the apparent resistance to medicine was less a characteristic of the parasite itself or even of certain strains of parasites than of the infected individual in whom it represented a lowering of the protective powers of the organism . in a chapter on malaria in the renowned clinical medicine handbook edited by klemperer he claimed that many cases of tropical malaria caused by p. falciparum were found to be resistant to treatment using drugs because the treatment was inadequate this is why during the war and in the following years so much was said about the malaria parasites resistance to quinine. according to heiner fangerau the combination of mendel and weissmann s ideas that formed the groundwork for rodenwaldt s analyses of resistance represented a watershed for the theories of racial hygiene it becoming clear how predictable was the inheritance of isolated features.", "the question as to whether the surgical ability of the operator or the inherent tumour biology of the disease is the main factor impacting on survival remains a debate . found a 5.5percent increase in median survival for every 10percent increase in the proportion of patients achieving maximal

secondary cytoreduction could also improve survival subsequently the role of interval debulking surgery ids has been investigated in three prospective randomized controlled trials rcts 57 where conclusions are different . indeed this is still the only prospective rct showing a survival benefit with debulking surgery . the term ids should be confined to patients who have had primary surgical debulking but it has been used in situations whereby a primary surgical attempt is delayed until during chemotherapy . hegazy et al . survival benefit was clear for patients with optimum secondary cytoreductive surgery followed by chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone at the time of recurrence . there is agreement that one of the most important prognostic factors for survival in the treatment of ovarian cancer is the amount of residual tumour after cytoreduction 4 16 . unlike in previous decades the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy seems to have gained some popularity though the real impact requires the formal publication of the randomized trials eortc 55971 and chorus .", "electron microscopy may also assist the diagnosis by demonstrating intracytoplasmic inclusions named

remarkable that studies of rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility and schizophrenia that differ in design and population cohort should arrive at similar relative risk estimates this consistency suggests that the relative risk of schizophrenia due to rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility although small is substantively meaningful and worthy of more investigation . there also is evidence that the clinical effects of rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility may occur earlier in gestation for male fetuses compared to female fetuses . this hypothesis further suggests that female fetuses may be at increased risk for schizophrenia when subject to prenatal obstetric complications that produce hypoxia or hyperbilirubinemia but that these effects must occur earlier in the gestational period to increase their risk of schizophrenia a timing effect . there is some empirical evidence that situations where maternal sensitization would not occur that is hla matching between

these results were interpreted to suggest that mmp9 expression is involved in activity dependent remodeling via influencing synaptic connections . the intrahippocampal infusion of an mmp2 and 9 inhibitor followed by titanic stimulation resulted in a strong potentiation comparable to control ltp . although the neural mechanisms underlying habituation has not been identified the hippocampus has been implicated in the control of inhibitory processes particularly habituation 108110 . these results suggested that elevations in mmp3 could mediate the changes in neural plasticity that may accompany habituation however the introduction of the animal into a new environment also appeared to elevate mmp3 expression in these same brain structures but to a lesser extent . who noted

which is converted to other prostanoid species including pgd2 pge2 pgf2 prostacyclin pgi2 and thromboxane tx a2 by the action of specific synthases 13 . the synthesis of pgd2 from its precursor pgh2 is catalyzed by two pgd synthases pgdss . the importance of the role of pgd2 in the pathogenesis and resolution of inflammation and innate immune response is increasingly recognized 6 7 . this is further complicated by the fact that pgd2 undergoes nonenzymatic processes to generate 15d pgj2 an anti inflammatory lipid . thus it is evident that l pgds has several key regulatory roles that extend beyond its function in the brain . similar to h pgds in models of allergic inflammation l pgds has shown to be proinflammatory . we have studied the role of l pgds in lps induced inflammation and shown that l pgds is induced in vitro in macrophages 33 34 and in vivo in the lung in response to lps and p. aeruginosa . both h and l pgd synthase enzymes may form pgd2 in vitro but it is not fully

prevalence of oab symptoms is greater in patients with pop than without pop . there are many possible theories regarding the pathophysiology of oab in relation to pop and it is likely that bladder obstruction plays an important role . as in other studies we found the prevalence of oab symptoms increased with advancing age 3 8 . other studies are not conclusive about the role of smoking in oab 17 20 21 . the induction of oab in smoking could be related to an anti oestrogenic hormonal effect on the bladder and uretra and a nicotine induced phasic contraction of the detrusor muscle . surprisingly we found previous prolapse surgery to be a predictor for the symptom urgency this in contrast to practically all studies that showed an improvement of oab symptoms after prolapse surgery

clearance . the effects of tnf are known to be mediated by tnf receptor i tnf ri or tnf rii . numerous randomized clinical trials and meta analyses have demonstrated the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies against tnf for both induction and maintenance of remission in both cd and uc 1618 . infliximab ifx a chimeric monoclonal antibody composed of human constant and murine variable regions and adalimumab a fully human monoclonal igg1 anti tnf antibody demonstrated their efficacy for the control of disease activity and the induction of clinical remission and mucosal healing in luminal cd and

irregular dietary patterns and the link between abnormal dietary intake and obesity several reports described the link between caries and weight indicating that obese children had more caries than children in the normal weight group . the aims of the present study were 1 to assess the caries prevalence and severity in 8year old children of qingdao and 2 to assess the relationship between caries disease and the weight status in 8year old children of qingdao . a total of 758 children from 28 primary schools in qingdao were initially included in this study . among the permanent teeth except for the first permanent molar the mean dmft values were 0.43 in males and 0.61 in females in permanent dentition . significantly higher caries prevalence was found in mandibular deciduous molars 49.0 as

side of the synapse bind to receptors of the opposite surface . fusion of recycling endosomes to the plasma membrane allows expression of protein of the cell a at the surface of cell b. back fusion also allows the release of the intraluminal content of exosomes proteins and rnas of cell a into the cytosol of cell b. it is important to note that steps 9 10 and 11 remain speculative . in neurons electron microscopy em observations of the adult hippocampus revealed the presence of mvbs and sorting endosomes in dendritic shafts and inside a limited number of spines which represent post synaptic parts of glutamatergic synapses figure 2b cooney et al . 2005 . the compartments fusing at the plasma membrane of cultured neurons were identified as recycling endosomes because tfr is usually detected in recycling endosomes and rab11 or syntaxin 13 are known regulators of recycling endosomes . tsg101 belongs to the endosomal sorting complex required for transport escrt0 to iii necessary for the making of ilvs accumulating inside mvbs babst 2011 . three other studies reported secretion of exosomes by neurons vingtdeux et al . 2010 . in non neuronal cells the fact that exosomal rnas can act on receiving cells demonstrates that exosome intralumenal cargoes are released into the cytosol i.e. furthermore even though the activity dependent release of exosomes suggests a genuine function of exosomes in synaptic plasticity molecular tools to specifically block mvb fusion with the plasma membrane must be developed to test this hypothesis .", "the ureter was seen to course

0.0001 . recently there have been increasing concerns about the effects of withdrawal of medications on the entry into clinical trials . however the question arises as to whether this is a safety concern due to sudden withdrawal of a high dose of systemically absorbed inhaled corticosteroids or if the observations are surrogate measures of efficacy . in the case of the towards a revolution in copd health torch study this phenomenon led in effect to two comparisons ie withdrawal of inhaled corticosteroids compared with continuation of inhaled corticosteroids in patients previously taking these agents and introduction of inhaled corticosteroids compared with placebo in patients not previously taking inhaled corticosteroids . furthermore we have demonstrated a similar reduction in the number of exacerbations per patient year in those who continued and those who discontinued inhaled anticholinergic therapy upon randomization into these tiotropium clinical trials . the effect of ipratropium which is the short acting anticholinergic taken by many patients prior to entry into the tiotropium trials is well understood to be restricted to antimuscarinic smooth muscle relaxation and presumably wears off relatively quickly although there is some evidence that the effects of extended therapy with ipratropium persist longer than the conventional 68hour duration of acute bronchodilation.24 although considered a short acting bronchodilator ipratropium alone or in combination with albuterol has been shown to reduce exacerbations compared with albuterol alone.25 this observation suggests that one should consider whether a rebound effect ie an increase in exacerbation rate might be a consequence of ipratropium withdrawal .", "with wsi scanning these magnifications

calculated for each experimental group . regarding body weight alterations normoxic and hypoxic tlr4 mice were not different from their respective control animals figure 1b . hypoxic c57bl6 mice had morphological and functional alterations of their aorta as they exhibited larger intima media thickness figures 3a and 3b and higher nfb p50 activity figure 3c . here we showed in nonobese c57bl6 mice that ih induced morphological and inflammatory remodeling of vascular and white adipose tissues as well as insulin resistance . these results are in agreement with previous reports in lean c57bl6 and apoe mice after 4 and 6 weeks of ih respectively . as observed in mice models of diet induced obesity 30 32 tlr4 deficiency prevented the enhanced release of tnf and il6 in our hypoxic mice . interestingly this beneficial effect occurred while insulin resistance a well known risk factor for atherosclerosis was not improved by ewat lipectomy suggesting that ewat inflammation could be the main determinant of ih induced atherogenicity . a recent study also identified tlr4 signaling pathway as a direct key mediator of vascular inflammation and impairment of endothelial insulin signaling

the immunocompromised effects on macrophages and lymphocytes likely drive an inflammatory state to contribute to the occurrence of diabetic complications . although changes of serum levels of il17 were not significant in this meta analysis of t2 dm patients versus controls il17 may be a clue to the possible involvement of th17 cells in t2 dm pathogenesis . secondly in the presence of high serum

cooperation of the ed staff . median delay for eeg was 2 days ct brain was 1 day and mri was 2.5 days . 97 patients had an established history of either generalised or focal epilepsy and 72 patients had epilepsy associated with significant medical and surgical comorbidities . in 2008 2009 68 19 of the total cohort of 350 had mr imaging of the brain requested . of the 57 patients with nonepileptic collapse 12 had an eeg 18 patients had ct brain and only one patient had an mri brain performed . the aim of this study was to demonstrate improvements in for patients presenting to the ed with seizures and related disorders without compromising safety by the use of an evidence based seizure care pathway . comparison of hipe data between 2004 with that of 2009 following implementation of the seizure care pathway shows a reduction in the number of admissions with a specific diagnosis of epilepsy from 2.9 341 of total hospital admissions to 2.2 276 . the reduction in median length of stay from 4 days in 2004 and 5 days in 2006 to 2 days during the intervention study in 2008 2009 was made possible by an emphasis upon early safe discharge in the pathway with an eye to reduce bed occupancy days . it appears that a large proportion of seizure related presentations are referred to the in house medical or neurological teams for admission due in large part to the lack of access to appropriate algorithms for admission and decision support for early treatment and diagnostic investigation and the difficulty in obtaining outpatient investigations and specialist epilepsy follow up in a reasonable length of time .", "from dissolving solution the rapid patho tb test was performed with those treated samples following the procedure presented in the following section . thereafter the funnel and the pre filter were removed and a second wash was done with 2 drops of washing solution . a two sided significance level of 0.05 was used . further studies on larger number of sputum smear negative ptb patients are required to clear the characteristic performance of patho tb test .", "within 23 mins of the first injection the cat collapsed developed profuse vomiting and diarrhea as well as facial swelling and diffuse erythema . clinicians should be aware of this potential complication particularly in animals with a previous history of insulin administration and the potential to utilize intradermal testing with insulin . the purpose of this case report is to describe the clinical manifestation and management of a cat with an hr to subcutaneous glargine insulin gi administration . the cat also demonstrated projectile vomiting and diarrhea . blood work was also repeated at this time and showed normalization of the lactate and potassium levels . the cat was discharged 3 days after presentation on metronidazole 10 mg kg po q12h and famotidine 1 mg kg po q24h . the owners infrequently measured the cat s bg 12 times weekly and it was never greater than 200 mg dl . in humans type iv hrs it appears given the acute presentation and history of prior exposure to insulin the cat in this case demonstrated a type i hr but this was not conclusively proven . there was subjectively more swelling and discomfort noted at the gi injection site the gi site also appeared more erythematous . management of insulin hr involves exclusion of poor injection technique use of alternative forms of insulin splitting the dose and injection into separate sites and addition of antihistamines .", "furthermore it is the most common cause of antenatal hospital admission.1

microdrops min . since in our setting only preterm pregnant women of 24 to 33 weeks of gestation would receive a course of antenatal corticosteroid administration for accelerate fetal lung maturation . during the studied period a total of 424 pregnant women met the diagnosis of preterm labor or threatened preterm labor . there were histories of obstetrical medical andor surgical complications during pregnancy among studied women . regarding the type of tocolytic agents terbutaline was the most frequently selected tocolytic agent followed by nifedipine . the significant risk factor of inhibition failure was preterm uterine contraction with cervical dilatation preterm labor . in the present study the success rate to prolong pregnancy at least 48 hours was 93.8 in threatened preterm labor group and that of preterm labor group was 60.9 . in spite of the success rate of preterm uterine contraction inhibition was as high as 86.4 in this study for example the mean birth weight of babies was approximately 2300 g and a half of them had low birth weight 2500 g . regarding the evaluation of pregnancy outcomes of uterine contraction inhibition with tocolytic agents further research on threatened preterm labor with or without tocolysis would be necessary .", "unfortunately after completing these tests she missed 3 follow up appointments and was seen in our clinic only one year

the most important data management challenges faced by the consortium is the high complexity and heterogeneity of the data types involved the necessity to link different data types and the need to protect controlled data . however in order to make these data comparable across different cancer projects and create a unified icgc data set a mechanism for enforcing uniformity is required . in order to link individual biomart databases into a unified system these servers can each access data in three ways they can access their own local databases directly they can communicate with the other icgc biomart servers in order to retrieve data from remote databases and they can communicate with non icgc biomart servers such as cosmic 6 and reactome 7 to retrieve publicly available annotation data .

exhibiting all three phenotypes and genotyped k3tau positive were culled as were any mice failing to display any of the phenotypes and genotyped k3tau negative . hereinafter we will be discussing five pedigrees for which we have arrived at different stages of out crossing and identification of the underlying gene mutations starting with those pedigrees with which we have the least progressed . this narrows down the linked mutation carrying region to less than 20 mb at which point candidate genes in the region will be sequenced to detect mutant alleles and eventually the causative mutation . there is evidence that point mutations in the tbx1 gene can also cause the disorder . intriguingly these mouse models reveal that interference with either of two distinct phases of pharyngeal

caused by infections which may also influence their attitude to red eye . most 96.2 respondents attitude toward red eye was poor a finding quite different from that reported in kano where 52.8 of students had a poor attitude toward severe ocular disorders . perception grade and attitude of this population were poor this may mean that the perception and attitude to red eye even though very common is low in the general population as the students are actually reflecting what they have learnt from their homes . appropriate eye health services and education should be included in school

examination under light microscopy revealed a diffuse and moderate proliferation of mesangial cells and endothelial cells without observable crescents in 20 glomeruli . the patient had been followed up to date and showed normal renal function and mild proteinuria . renal disease and acute kidney injury remains prevalent and is associated with the increased mortality of patients with severe burn injuries . first this patient did not have any urinary abnormalities or chronic kidney diseases before and at the early stage of burn injury . in addition the patient suffered from skin problems with slight exudation bleeding cracks mild scaling and itch during the treatment process fig . although a causal relationship between igan and burn injury has not been established an association of cutaneous lesions after burn injury with igan has been reported in a few patients 2 4 . the patient revealed a rapid recovery after complete removal of the scars without any medication . both have inherent genetic predisposition and external infections which may induce igan . after serious burns the immune system is disordered the immune complex is increased in the circulation and macrophages

autonomic tone in these patients may also be related to ventricular arrhythmias . dispersion of the qt interval was measured as the difference between the maximum and minimum mean qt intervals recorded in any of the 12 leads of the standard ecg . after completing the computer based measurements qtd was tested to identify intra observer variability in 25 randomly selected patients using the bland altman method . the 95 limit of agreement for qtd was 9.2 and 5.8 ms respectively figure 1b . continuous variables are reported as mean standard deviations sd and categorical variables are expressed as percentages . the major findings of this study are 1 successful revascularization may improve qtcd in patients with cto 2 the revascularization in cto lesions does not seem to have a significant impact on hrv and 3 the impact on hrv does not change with the intervention to the lad cx or rca . a direct relationship between the prolongation of the qt interval and myocardial ischemia

follow up and heterogeneous patient population with concomitant diseases .", "on exposure to light with a wavelength near 400 nm the porphyrins enter an excited state that can lead to the damage of proteins lipids and basement membranes.6 this process results in blisters fibrosis and scarring of the skin in areas of the body exposed to sunlight.6 park et al7 have reported a case of a 31year old with cicatricial conjunctivitis who was biopsy negative for ocp and was later diagnosed with porphyria cutanea tarda in this case the patient s clinical symptoms significantly improved after initiating phlebotomy treatments . examination of the corneas revealed multiple punctate epithelial erosions . the patient was started on methotrexate 15 mg by mouth weekly and prednisone 20 mg by mouth daily . after 4 months of treatment with the methotrexate the patient s conjunctival inflammation began to worsen and his regimen was subsequently changed from methotrexate to mmf 1000 mg by

group had an average age of 56.6 range 40 to 72 and an average gravidity of 3.6 range 0 to 8 . the number of lymph nodes was not significantly different between the groups p0.05 . following this achievement the laparoscope has gained importance among gynecologic oncologists especially in patients with early endometrial and cervical cancers . another randomized study comparing the laparoscopicvaginal approach with the conventional abdominal approach for treatment of patients with endometrial cancer was performed including 70 patients with endometrial cancer figo stage i iii . thirty seven patients were treated in the laparoscopic group versus 33 patients in the laparotomy group . blood loss and yield of pelvic and paraaortic lymph nodes duration of surgery and incidence of postoperative complications were similar for both groups . while comparing laparotomy and laparoscopy the number of residual nodes following lymphadenectomy has also been studied because lymph nodes left in situ might have had microscopic metastases . increasing numbers of advanced laparoscopic applications like expanded lymph node dissections and more radicalness in treating gynecologic cancers have caused surgeons to face other complications as well . duration of laparoscopic surgery does not seem to be different from that of laparotomy .", "", "for both models association between markers simulation studies have shown that populations that have a demographic history more consistent with the cgf model of admixture retain ald over larger chromosomal regions and show significant associations between unlinked marker loci . since the amount of ald created is proportional to the level of admixture in a population it is important briefly to review studies on admixture levels across populations . in a sample of mexican americans from arizona the admixture estimates obtained using a weighted least squares method showed 29 4 per cent native american 68 5 per cent european and 3 2 per cent west african contribution . a prerequisite for testing ancestry phenotype correlations is the presence of stratification related to admixture which will be evident in variation in individual ancestry levels . following the argument of chakraborty and weiss admixture proportions should be correlated with diseases traits that differ in populations due to underlying genetic differences . c percent african ancestry versus melanin index m in puerto ricans from new york city ancestry estimated using 35 aims the relationship between percent african ancestry and skin pigmentation in three populations . simulation studies suggest that sample sizes of 200 300 patients typed for 200 300 evenly spaced markers each having allele frequency differentials 0.3 have a 95 per cent chance of locating the causative gene when there has been no new admixture from the parental population in the last four generations and no other sources of population structure or sample heterogeneity . other approaches proposed for using admixture include a method based on the transmission disequilibrium test tdt that assesses excess transmission of alleles derived from high risk ancestors to affected offspring of parents who are heterozygous at the marker locus containing one allele from each of two ancestral populations . allelic ancestry at a locus is inferred from the marker by using the conditional probability of each allelic state given the ancestry specific allele frequencies . variation in individual admixture introduces population stratification which in turn can inflate the number of significant associations that are observed and is a potential confounder in association studies 2957 59 .", "studies with purified nos proteins revealed that they possess

presence of lactate hyperosmolality increased glucose concentration presence of glucose degradation products gdp and advanced glycation end products ages and icodextrin metabolites among others 6 7 . the latter is recognized as playing a role in angiogenesis a histological characteristic that allows for differentiation from simple peritoneal fibrosis to eps . thickening and cubic transformation of mesothelial cells occurs and is more accentuated in the parietal peritoneum . one of the presentations of uf failure occurs due to the increase in pores in the peritoneal membrane which in turn accelerates small solute transport dissipating the osmotic gradient necessary to maintain adequate fluid balance . these findings help justify the increase in transport of small molecules while the alterations in the uf coefficient are only moderate . in addition to uf failure clinical manifestations such as severe malnutrition subocclusion or intestinal occlusion and ascites suggest the presence of eps even after discontinuation of pd .", "by using these monoclonal antibodies it is possible to determine different circulating forms of ck18 in plasma or serum 12 13.the m30 antibody

cardiovascular related morbidity and mortality . table 1 presents the stages of ovarian aging in female rats . studies have found that the majority of human females who undergo natural menopause exhibit different age associated cardiovascular alterations than those who underwent ovariectomy induced menopause . therefore other age related causes must occur independently of estrogen loss that promotes cvd in postmenopausal human females as is shown by the fact that estrogen replacement therapy is not cardioprotective after menopause 53 54 . the increased risk of cvd in human females may be due to differences in the type or magnitude of age associated alterations in cardiac structure and function . aging in the male rat heart is associated with the accumulation of oxidative damage to lipids and proteins as well as decline in mitochondrial enzymes . to our knowledge only a few studies have investigated the changes in nfb expression and activity in the aging female rat heart . similar to that seen in other parts of the cardiovascular system differences in aortic structure and function between genders have also been observed in the aging human and animals . however the fact that human females do not display cardiac hypertrophy or myocyte loss in the absence of loading abnormalities with aging may suggest the presence of estrogen prior to menopause acts to attenuate the cardiac response to preexisting underlying pathologies . the global changes in the body with age may play a cumulative role in combination with the hormonal changes seen in reproductive senescence .", "the observed changes were similar to those caused in pigs at the end of the 4month period of exposure to higher levels markedly above 200 ppb of pure ota in feed . furthermore to ascribe the source of ota to the a. ochraceus group of fungi is unwise because ochratoxinogenic forms are isolated so rarely 18 52 . in such a way the extent to which ota may interact with other components of commercial chicken pig rations or human food compounded from agricultural produce may also influence the significance of the relatively lower doses of ota that commercial chickens 23 27 pigs 18 21 or humans may encounter in some feed food . as a result the bioavailability of ota and probably the toxicity to ruminants is decreased . large quantities of ota can be produced at intermediate and high ambient temperatures and high moisture contents by species belonging to the penicillium and aspergillus whereas at lower ambient temperature the toxin can be produced by penicillium spp . the concentration of protein in the diet of growing chicks was also shown to ameliorate the toxicity of ota 97 98 . this resulted in eightfold and fourfold higher levels of ota in serum and liver of mice respectively during the first 12 h which could also increase its elimination . it is known that ota induces an increase of the weight of the organs taking part in its detoxification or elimination kidneys and liver as well as a decrease of the lymphoid organs weight and body weight whereas some of the studied feed additives 5 artichoke extract 0.02 roxazyme g 8 sesame seed 0.0025 phenylalanine significantly protects against these weight changes as the protective effect of sesame seed and roxazyme g against these weight changes was stronger than the protective effect of artichoke extract and phenylalanine . thus the loss of condemnation of pig chicken production would be prevented and a better procedure than toxicological invesigations of enlarged mottled kidneys accepted in denmark would be realized for preventing the exposure of humans to ota from meat 2123 114 . however having in mind that a combined administration of ota and other mycotoxins such a pa often occurrs in the practice and synergistic effects between ota and the same mycotoxins are reported the lower contamination levels of ota in food feed would be also very dangerous for human and animal health 22 30 .", "the

complete a patient s transfer from a high technological icu to a general ward many studies demonstrate the experiences of the transition but there is no clear description of the process and how it could be organized in order to be safe 511 . therefore the aim of this study was to describe as experienced by intensive care and general ward staff what strategies could be used when organizing patient s care before during and after transfer from intensive care . transitions can be initiated by such events as acute illness or injury which also explains why the concept is a nursing concern . securing the patients care and preserving patient safety during icu transitional care one essential issue was to optimize the patient s vital functions prior to transfer a key component to minimize risk for adverse and readmissions which were commonly referred to in the interviews . the staff described the coordination between the icu and the department to which the patient would be transferred as a foundation for collaboration especially when the patient had been cared for in the icu for a long time . one icu nurse said it is important to communicate early and tell them the staff at the ward about every need that the patient may have and not cover or exclude anything . collaborating and arranging a pretransfer meeting between ward staff and the patients and their families before transfer was expressed as one appreciated strategy . the nurses expressed that it also was vital that the physician at the ward checked out the ordinations and wrote an updated status in the patient s record so that they had a tool for managing their care.its not just that the patient must be in good condition when he or she is discharged from the icu the care must also continue with high quality at the general ward . the results in this study showed that icu transitional care is a complex multidisciplinary process that involves collaboration both within the icu and within other units involved

effects of chemotherapy 5 7 . in their retrospective series of 51 recurrent high grade gliomas treated with bevacizumab and irinotecan zuniga et al . and friedman et al . a prior post hoc analysis of the response characteristics from the pivotal phase iii trial indicates that secondary glioblastomas as well as low or no dexamethasone usage are potentially important predictors of response in patients treated with the novottf100a device alone 7 17 . although our patient s tumor appears to be a primary glioblastoma by the lack of idh1 immunohistochemical labeling there could still be unidentified genetic mutations that make her tumor susceptible to ttfields therapy . at the time of tumor recurrence this type of distant recurrence of glioblastoma could be the consequence of progressive development of the invasive phenotype intracranial inhomogeneity of the ttfields or incomplete coverage of certain parts of the brain by ttfields .", "to the present date there is no

clear cell rcc predominantly fuhrman grade 2 with focal areas of grade 3 . these features suggested that the tumor deposit in the fat was likely due to tumor seeding rather than a metastasis and that the tumor seeding could have resulted from the needle biopsy . it is also difficult because of underreporting to associate the risk of needle tract seeding with the number of needle passes through a tumor . visualization of larger coaxial needles on ultrasound or ct may be easier than with smaller biopsy needles and this may improve accuracy . in conclusion a common feature in all reported cases of needle tract seeding from a renal mass biopsy is that a coaxial needle was not used .", "cholesterol may also play a role in lung surfactant inactivation in acute lung injury ali and acute

dppc does not change with added cholesterol but that both surface pressure and cholesterol act to decrease the mismatch between the lipid headgroup and tailgroup area in the same way . however b remains constant as this spacing does not change with tilt if the alkane chains retain their close packed configuration . hence this shape complementarity suggests that chol can relieve the packing

been affected by this shift from inpatient to outpatient services . the adoption of pps by medicare in 1983 changed the payment basis for hospital inpatient care from hospital specific costs to diagnosis related groups drgs . the annual number of outpatient visits reported by community hospitals rose from approximately 210 million to 270 million from 1984 to 1988 . the null hypothesis of no misspecification no correlation with the error term is tested by comparing two sets of parameter estimates of the cost function one using total fixed assets and one using an instrumental variable that

aha data . the implications of market concentration for hospital costs have been addressed in a number of recent works . the results of the estimated cost functions were used to disaggregate total costs into inpatient and outpatient components . assuming that total costs are the sum of inpatient costs and outpatient costs the desired adjustment factor may be expressed as adjusted discharges are then calculated as the latter is algebraically equivalent to dividing inpatient cost by unadjusted discharges ic dis . the discrepancy between cost and revenue based unit costs and adjustment factors is most serious among hospitals that are smaller less urban and non teaching as seen by comparing the results listed in tables 4 and 5 as well as the results in table 6 . if relatively high outpatient

", " due primarily to the increasing shortage of allogeneic donor organs , xenotransplantation has become the focus of a growing field of research . \n currently , micropigs are the most suitable donor animal for humans . however , no standard method has been developed to evaluate the systemic vascular anatomy of micropigs and standard reference values to aid in the selection of normal healthy animals as potential organ donors are lacking . using 64-channel multidetector row computed tomographic angiography ( mdcta ) , we evaluated morphological features of the major systemic vessels in micropigs and compared our results to published human data . \n the main vasculature of the animals was similar to that of humans , except for the iliac arterial system . \n however , diameters of the major systemic vessels were significantly different between micropigs and humans . \n specifically , the diameter of the aortic arch , abdominal aorta , external iliac artery , and femoral artery , were measured as 1.50  0.07 cm , 0.85  0.06 cm , 0.52  0.05 cm , and 0.48  0.05 cm , respectively , in the micropigs . \n this mdcta data for micropig major systemic vessels can be used as standard reference values for xenotransplantation studies . \n the use of 64-channel mdcta enables accurate evaluation of the major systemic vasculature in micropigs . ", " amide hydrogen / deuterium exchange ( h / d exchange ) coupled with mass spectrometry has been widely used to analyze the interface of protein - protein interactions , protein conformational changes , protein dynamics and protein - ligand interactions . \n h / d exchange on the backbone amide positions has been utilized to measure the deuteration rates of the micro - regions in a protein by mass spectrometry1,2,3 . \n the resolution of this method depends on pepsin digestion of the deuterated protein of interest into peptides that normally range from 3 - 20 residues . \n although the resolution of h / d exchange measured by mass spectrometry is lower than the single residue resolution measured by the heteronuclear single quantum coherence ( hsqc ) method of nmr , the mass spectrometry measurement in h / d exchange is not restricted by the size of the protein4 . \n h / d exchange is carried out in an aqueous solution which maintains protein conformation . we provide a method that utilizes the maldi - tof for detection2 , instead of a hplc / esi ( electrospray ionization)-ms system5,6 . \n the maldi - tof provides accurate mass intensity data for the peptides of the digested protein , in this case protein kinase pak2 ( also called -pak ) . \n proteolysis of pak 2 is carried out in an offline pepsin digestion . \n this alternative method , when the user does not have access to a hplc and pepsin column connected to mass spectrometry , or when the pepsin column on hplc does not result in an optimal digestion map , for example , the heavily disulfide - bonded secreted phospholipase a2 ( spla2 ) . \n utilizing this method , we successfully monitored changes in the deuteration level during activation of pak2 by caspase 3 cleavage and autophosphorylation7,8,9 . ", " according to a patient - centered viewpoint , the meaning of harmonization in the context of laboratory medicine is that the information should be comparable irrespective of the measurement procedure used and where and/or when a measurement is made . \n harmonization represents a fundamental aspect of quality in laboratory medicine as its ultimate goal is to improve patient outcomes through the provision of an accurate and actionable laboratory information . \n although the initial focus has to a large extent been to harmonize and standardize analytical processes and methods , the scope of harmonization goes beyond to include all other aspects of the total testing process ( ttp ) , such as terminology and units , report formats , reference intervals and decision limits , as well as tests and test profiles request and criteria for interpretation . \n two major progresses have been made in the area of harmonization in laboratory medicine : first , the awareness that harmonization should take into consideration not only the analytical phase but all steps of the ttp , thus dealing with the request , the sample , the measurement , and the report . \n second , as the processes required to achieve harmonization are complicated , a systematic approach is needed . \n the international federation of clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine ( ifcc ) has played a fundamental and successful role in the development of standardized and harmonized assays , and now it should continue to work in the field through the collaboration and cooperation with many other stakeholders . ", " type 2 diabetes is a heterogeneous disorder that develops as a result of relatively inappropriate insulin secretion and insulin resistance . increased levels of free fatty acids ( ffas ) are one of the important factors for the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and contribute to defective -cell proliferation and increased -cell apoptosis . \n recently , glucagon - like peptide-1 ( glp-1 ) receptor agonists have been shown to possess an antiapoptotic effect , by increasing -cell mass and improving -cell function . \n however , their effects on -cells in vitro against lipotoxicity have not been elucidated completely . in this study \n , we investigated whether the glp-1 receptor agonist exendin-4 displays prosurvival effects in pancreatic -cells exposed to chronic elevated ffas . \n results showed that exendin-4 inhibited apoptosis induced by palmitate in min6 cells . \n after 24  h of incubation , exendin-4 caused rapid activation of extracellular signal - related kinase 1/2 ( erk1/2 ) under lipotoxic conditions . \n the erk1/2 inhibitor pd98059 blocked the antilipotoxic effect of exendin-4 on min6 cells . \n exendin-4 also inhibited the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis . \n this inhibition is associated with upregulation of bcl-2 . \n our findings suggested that exendin-4 may exert cytoprotective effects through activation of erk1/2 and inhibition of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway . ", " ribonucleic acids ( rna ) are hypothesized to have preceded their derivatives , deoxyribonucleic acids ( dna ) , as the molecular media of genetic information when life emerged on earth . \n molecular biologists are accustomed to the dramatic effects a subtle variation in the ribose moiety composition between rna and dna can have on the stability of these molecules . while dna is very stable after extraction from biological samples and subsequent treatment , rna is notoriously labile . the short half - life property , inherent to rna , benefits cells that do not need to express their entire repertoire of proteins . \n the cellular machinery turns off the production of a given protein by shutting down the transcription of its cognate coding gene and by either actively degrading the remaining mrna or allowing it to decay on its own . \n the steady - state level of each mrna in a given cell varies continuously and is specified by changing kinetics of synthesis and degradation . because it is technically possible to simultaneously measure thousands of nucleic acid molecules , \n these quantities have been studied by the life sciences community to investigate a range of biological problems . \n since the rna abundance can change according to a wide range of perturbations , this makes it the molecule of choice for exploring biological systems ; its instability , on the other hand , could be an underestimated source of technical variability . we found that a large fraction of the rna abundance originally present in the biological system prior to extraction was masked by the rna labeling and measurement procedure . \n the method used to extract rna molecules from cells and to label them prior to hybridization operations on dna arrays affects the original distribution of rna . \n only if rna measurements are performed according to the same procedure can biological information be inferred from the assay read out .

", " backgroundabnormal lipid levels are considered one of the most significant risk factors for atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease , two of the main causes of death worldwide . \n apart from monogenic cases of hypercholesterolemia , most of the common dyslipidemias are caused by a number of low - impact polymorphisms . \n it has recently been reported that frequent polymorphisms at a large number of loci are significantly associated with one or more blood lipid parameters in many populations . \n identifying these associations in different populations and estimating the possible interactions between genetic models are necessary to explain the underlying genetic architecture of the associated loci and their ultimate impact on lipid - associated traits.methodswe estimated the association between 144 common single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) from published genome - wide association studies and the levels of total cholesterol , low- and high - density lipoprotein  cholesterol , and triglycerides in 1273 individuals from the genome database of the latvian population . \n we analyzed a panel of 144 common snps with illumina goldengate genotyping assays on the illumina beadxpress system.resultsten snps at the cetp locus and two at the mlxipl locus were associated with reduced high - density lipoprotein  \n cholesterol levels ; one snp at the tomm40 locus was associated with increased low - density lipoprotein  \n cholesterol ; and four snps at the mlxipl locus were associated with increased log triglyceride levels . \n there was also a significant correlation between the number of risk alleles and all the lipid parameters , suggesting that the coexistence of many low - impact snps has a greater effect on the dyslipidemia phenotype than the individual effects of found snps.conclusionwe conclude that the cetp , mlxipl , and tomm40 loci are the strongest genetic factors underlying the variability in lipid traits in our population .

", " purposewe investigated the feasibility of glaucoma detection by measuring retinal surface contour variability ( rscv ) using optical coherence tomography ( oct).methodsthe peripapillary region in one eye of each participant was scanned over an 8  8 mm area with a swept source oct prototype . \n the retinal surface contour was sampled at approximately 1.5- to 3.5-mm radius circles centered on the optic nerve head . \n the rscv is defined as the average log value within a middle spatial frequency band of the fourier transform to the elevation profile of the inner retinal surface . \n the spatial frequency band was optimized to distinguish glaucoma from normal . \n nerve fiber layer thickness ( nflt ) was sampled around a 1.7-mm radius circle . \n glaucoma severity was assessed by automated static perimetry.resultswe enrolled 17 glaucomatous eyes and 17 healthy eyes . \n a great majority of the glaucoma group were in the early stage ( visual field mean deviation average 2.48  3.73 db ) . \n significant differences were found for rscv between glaucoma and control eyes ( p < 0.003 ) at all radii . \n the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( aroc = 0.90 ) of rscv was best at the 3.5-mm radius . \n this was not significantly better than nflt ( aroc = 0.84 ) . with the 99% specificity , \n the glaucoma detection sensitivity was 53% for rscv and 29% for nflt \n ( p = 0.13).conclusionsretinal surface contour variability was significantly increased in glaucoma patients . \n the diagnostic accuracy of rscv was equal to nflt in early glaucoma . \n since the rscv detects small - scale focal damage and the average nflt measures global damage , they provide different diagnostic information that may be synergistic . ", " retained intraocular graphite foreign bodies are uncommon . \n although they are generally inert , they have been reported to cause severe inflammatory reaction and progressive damage to intraocular structures . \n we report a case of a six - year - old girl with a retained intraocular graphite pencil lead foreign body in the anterior chamber of the eye and discuss the various considerations in the management of such cases . ", " one of the room temperature ionic liquids ( rtils ) , 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ( [ bmim]cl ) was chosen to prepare the concentrated solutions of polyacrylonitrile ( pan ) . \n the rheological behaviors of the solutions were measured with rotational rheometry under different conditions , including temperatures , concentration , and molecular weight of pan . \n the solutions exhibited shear - thinning behaviors , similar to that of pan / dmf solutions . \n the viscosities decreased with the increasing of shear rates . \n however , the viscosity decreased sharply at high shear rates when the concentration was up to 16wt% . \n the dependence of the viscosity on temperature was analyzed through the determination of the apparent activation energy . \n unusually , the viscosity of solutions of higher concentration is lower than that of lower concentration . \n similarly , the viscosity of low molecular weight pan was higher than high molecular weight pan at high shear rates . \n the dynamic rheological measurement indicates the loss modulus is much higher than storage modulus . \n the trend of complex viscosity is similar with the result of static rheological measurement . \n the interaction between pan and ionic liquid [ bmim]cl was discussed . ", " we report two cases of esophagobronchial fistulae diagnosed by multi - detector computed tomography ( mdct ) oral contrast swallow examination . \n it is helpful to supplement the ct study with an oral contrast swallow as it aids in confirmation of a suspected fistula and also demonstrates the fistula tract better . \n we present the clinical details and the imaging findings on mdct of two cases of esophagobronchial fistulae  one secondary to chronic chest tuberculosis and the other secondary to a squamous cell carcinoma of the upper esophagus  followed by discussion of the etiology , pathogenesis , and imaging of these fistulae . ", " most guidelines for clinical practice , and especially those for the construction of decision support tools , assume that the individual person ( the patient ) needs to be in possession of information of particular sorts and amount in order to qualify as having made an  \n informed decision. this often implicitly segues into the patient having made a  \n good decision. in person - centred health care , whether , in what form , and with what weight ,  information is included as a criterion of decision quality is a matter for the person involved , to decide in the light of their own values , preferences , and time and resource constraints . ", " high - grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia ( panin-3 ) is recognized as a precursor lesion of invasive ductal carcinoma ( idc ) . \n however , histological evidence that panin-3 invades beyond the basement membrane of pancreatic ductal epithelium , that is , the moment panin-3 becomes idc , has not been captured yet . \n this may be because panins which are microscopic papillary or flat lesion rarely develop clinical symptoms and are not detectable on imaging examination . \n on the other hand , most idcs were found in the advanced stage with massive invasion . in this report \n , panin-3 obstructed several branch pancreatic ducts and subsequently caused pancreatitis which developed clinical symptom and was detectable as a pancreatic mass in imaging studies . \n a 65-year - old woman was referred to our institution for further examination of her repeated pancreatitis . \n abdominal ultrasound revealed a low echoic mass of 13 mm in diameter in the pancreatic body without upstream dilatation of the main pancreatic duct ( mpd ) . \n endoscopic retrograde pancreatography showed a strictured segment of 2 mm in length in the mpd at the pancreatic body . \n cytological examination of pancreatic juice revealed adenocarcinoma and distal pancreatectomy was performed . \n a resected specimen revealed a whitish mass of 15 mm in diameter in the pancreatic body , which was identified as pancreatitis by histological examination . \n papillary growth of panin-3 was seen mainly in the branch ducts . \n each panin-3 was located separately in the branch ducts with normal epithelia in the mpd between them . in three adjacent branch ducts , \n panin-3 was observed to be invading microscopically beyond the basement membrane . ", " ductal adenocarcinoma is an unusual variant of adenocarcinoma of the prostate . \n a 73-year - old male was referred to our hospital for the further examination of an elevated prostate - specific antigen level of 23.4 ng / ml . \n radical prostatectomy ( rp ) was performed based on the diagnosis obtained by a prostate needle biopsy . \n the rp specimen revealed ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate with positive capsular penetration . \n we herein report a rare case of ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate . ", " the novottf-100a device emits alternating tumor treating electric fields ( ttfields ) that interfere with cytokinesis and chromosome segregation during mitosis . \n because it has a similar efficacy to cytotoxic chemotherapy , the device has been approved by the united states food and drug administration for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma . \n although bevacizumab has been in use for recurrent glioblastoma , patients who experience incomplete or no response to bevacizumab may be predisposed to early bevacizumab treatment failure . \n however , the addition of ttfields therapy may augment the efficacy from bevacizumab . \n we report a patient with recurrent cystic glioblastoma who received add - on ttfields therapy due to an incomplete response to single - agent bevacizumab . \n after 6 cycles of therapy , a resolution of cystic enhancement was noted , together with reduction of the tumor cyst and resolution of most of the cerebral edema in the surrounding brain . \n however , the patient also suffered from relapsed disease at locations distant from the original glioblastoma and the corresponding radiation fields received at initial diagnosis . \n we conclude that combination ttfields and bevacizumab therapy is safe and may be efficacious for patients with recurrent glioblastoma . \n a further study would be needed to determine the relapse pattern and the distribution of the electric fields in the brain . ", " the effect of aloe vera on the reduction of plaque and gingivitis was evaluated in a randomized , parallel and double - blind clinical trial . \n subjects were randomly allocated to the test group ( n=15 )  dentifrice containing aloe vera - or the control group ( n=15 )  fluoridated dentifrice . plaque index ( pi ) and gingival bleeding index ( gbi ) \n were assessed at days 0 and 30 . \n subjects were asked to brush their teeth with the control or test dentifrice , three times a day , during a 30-day period . \n there was a significant reduction on plaque and gingivitis in both groups , but no statistically significant difference was observed among them ( p>0.01 ) . \n the dentifrice containing aloe vera did not show any additional effect on plaque and gingivitis control compared to the fluoridated dentifrice . ", " primary mucinous carcinoma of the skin is a rare adnexal tumor of sweat gland origin . \n a case report is presented of a 70-year - old male , who presented with a slow growing mass near the lateral canthus of his left eye . \n the case was clinically diagnosed as a fibroma . \n an excisional biopsy of the lesion revealed mucinous carcinoma of the skin . \n investigations excluded the possibility of metastatic mucinous carcinoma . \n thus , the lesion in the lateral canthus region was diagnosed as primary mucinous carcinoma of the skin , a rare site of occurrence . ", " a 66-year - old man underwent computed tomography - guided needle biopsy of a suspicious renal mass . \n two months later he underwent partial nephrectomy . \n histology revealed a 30-mm clear cell renal cell carcinoma , up to fuhrman grade 3 . \n an area of the capsule was interrupted , which corresponded to a hemorrhagic area on the cortical surface . under microscopy \n , this area showed a tongue of tumor tissue protruding through the renal capsule . \n a tumor deposit was found in the perinephric fat . \n these features suggest that tumor seeding may have occurred during the needle biopsy . ", " adding small fractions of cholesterol \n decreases the interfacial \n viscosity of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine ( dppc ) monolayers by an \n order of magnitude per wt % . \n grazing incidence x - ray diffraction shows \n that cholesterol at these small fractions does not mix ideally with \n dppc but rather induces nanophase separated structures of an ordered , \n primarily dppc phase bordered by a line - active , disordered , mixed \n dppc - cholesterol phase . \n we propose that the free area in the classic \n cohen and turnbull model of viscosity is inversely proportional to \n the number of molecules in the coherence area , or product of the two \n coherence lengths . \n cholesterol significantly reduces the coherence \n area of the crystals as well as the interfacial viscosity . using this \n free area collapses the surface viscosity data for all surface pressures \n and cholesterol fractions to a universal logarithmic relation . \n the \n extent of molecular coherence appears to be a fundamental factor in \n determining surface viscosity in ordered monolayers . ", " abstractbackgroundthe centralization of human activities is associated with different pollutants which enter into environment easily and cause the urban environment more vulnerable . regarding the importance of air pollution issue for tehran metropolis , many plans and regulations have been developed . however , most of them failed to decline the pollution . \n the purpose of this study was to pathologically analyze air - pollution control plans to offer effective solutions for tehran metropolis.methodsa qualitative content analysis in addition to a semi - structured interview with 14 practicing professional were used to identify 1 ) key sources of tehran s air pollution , 2 ) recognize challenges towards effective performance of pertinent plans and 3 ) , offer effective solutions.resultsrelated challenges to air - pollution control plans can be divided into two major categories including lack of integrated and organized stewardship and pest challenges.conclusionfor controlling the air pollution of tehran effectively , various controlling alternatives were identified as systematization of plan preparation process , standardization and utilization of new technologies & experts , infrastructural development , realization of social justice , developing coordination mechanisms , improving citizens participatory capacity and focusing on effective management of fuel and energy.controlling air pollution in tehran needs a serious attention of policymakers to make enforcements through applying a systemic cycle of preparation comprehensive plans . \n further , implement the enforcements and evaluate the environmental impact of the plans through involving all stakeholders . ", " chiari malformation type i ( cm - i ) related to syndromic craniosynostosis in pediatric patients has been well - studied . \n the surgical management consists of cranial vault remodeling with or without posterior fossa decompression . \n there were also cases , in whom cm - i was diagnosed prior to the craniosynostosis in early childhood . \n we present a 16-year - old boy who admitted with symptoms related to cm - i . with careful examination and further genetic investigations , \n a diagnosis of crouzon syndrome was made , of which the patient and his family was unaware before . \n the patient underwent surgery for posterior fossa decompression and followed - up for crouzon 's syndrome . to our knowledge , this is the only case report indicating a late adolescent diagnosis of crouzon syndrome through clinical symptoms of an associated cm - i . ", " the risk of permanent hypoparathyroidism following thyroid and parathyroid surgery is around 1% in the hands of experienced endocrine surgeons .   \n although this complication is rare , rendering a patient permanently aparathyroid has significant consequences on the health and quality of life of the patient . \n immediate autotransplantation of parathyroid glands that are injured or unintentionally removed offers the best possibility of graft viability and functionality . \n however , since the majority of cases of hypoparathyroidism are transient , immediate autotransplantation can complicate postoperative surveillance in certain patients , especially those with primary hyperparathyroidism .   \n cryopreservation of parathyroid tissue is an alternate technique that was developed to treat patients with permanent hypoparathyroidism . \n this method allows for parathyroid tissue to be stored and then autotransplanted in a delayed fashion once permanent hypoparathyroidism is confirmed . \n this article provides a contemporary review on cryopreservation of parathyroid tissue and its current role in thyroid and parathyroid surgery . ", " in this article , the authors estimate a multiple - output cost function for a sample of 2,235 hospitals during the period 1984 - 88 to disaggregate total costs into inpatient and outpatient components . \n the results suggest that outpatient cost growth is roughly proportional to that of inpatient cost , despite much higher relative growth in revenues and utilization on the outpatient side . \n the stability in the outpatient / inpatient cost ratio implies that the increase in the outpatient - to - inpatient utilization ratio was offset by a decline in their relative unit costs . ", " backgroundwilms tumor ( wt ) is the most common malignant renal tumor in children . \n previous studies suggested the reversion - inducing , cysteine - rich protein with kazal motifs ( reck ) down - regulation might have a role in numerous human cancers . \n the current study was done to investigate the associations of reck single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) with the wt susceptibility in chinese children.material/methodswe analyzed 2 snps ( rs10972727and rs11788747 ) in a total of 97 wt children and 194 healthy matched controls ( 1:2 ratio ) by real - time pcr and pcr - rflp genotyping analysis.resultswe found that the g allele of rs11788747 in the reck gene was significantly associated with wt in chinese children ( or=0.7 , 95% ci : 0.450.99 ; p=0.042 ) ; as with another snp rs10972727 , however , no statistically significant difference was detected . \n further analysis showed there was also a statistically significant difference in genotype frequencies between terminal tumor stage ( p=0.026 ) and metastatic groups ( p=0.002).conclusionsthe present data indicate that there is a significant association between mutant g of rs11788747 in reck and wt risk . \n g carriers with advanced tumor stage or with metastasis might have an increased risk of wt .
