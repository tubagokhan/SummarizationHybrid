intervention based on advocacy program had been successful to reduce the prevalence of underweight among poor girls . this study shows determinant factor of nutritional status of school age children was their socio economic level . according to our knowledge this is the first study which determines the effect of a community intervention based on advocacy process on the malnutrition indices in a big city shiraz in iran . allocating millions of dollars to nffp by government selecting the malnourished students through an active screening system at primary and middle schools paying attention of policy makers to student s nutrition have provided the opportunity to combat the problem . the results of the mentioned study showed an improvement in the weight of children psychological test s scores and the grade point average following this school feeding program . the intervention in the present study had focused on the snack intake in the school time . there are some reports regarding the nutrition transition in iran which shows the importance of nutrition intervention to provide more healthy eating dietary habits among welfare groups of adolescents . hence nutrition intervention especially in the form of nutrition education is needed in big cities and among welfare children and adolescents . the same as this study in other studies have also emphasized that there must be efforts to strengthen the capacity within the schools to deal with the nutritional problems either overweight obesity or malnutrition by using of educational and nutritional intervention . regarding the nutritional needs of the school age children provision of a good platform for implementing and expanding this efficient model to the whole country based upon the socio economic situation of each region is advisable to the moh and the moe . community nutrition intervention based on the advocacy process model is effective on reducing the prevalence of underweight specifically among female school aged children .", " the observed benefit was independent of baseline iron parameters.1721 one study found a 36 reduction in the number of patients transfused.21 this pilot study assessed the efficacy and feasibility of iv iron monotherapy in patients with cancer who have anemia and who are undergoing treatment with chemotherapy andor radiation therapy without the use of esas . patients were also required to have a serum ferritin level of 100 ng ml or higher or transferrin saturation tsat levels of 15 or higher and to have received no esas or iv iron therapy within 30 days and no oral iron therapy 27 mg day or more within 7 days before enrollment . patients were excluded for leukoerythroblastic features on blood film hemolysis gastrointestinal bleeding folate or vitamin b12

hb serum ferritin reticulocyte count transferrin tsat serum iron total iron binding capacity red cell indices white blood cell count with differential platelet count and serum chemistries were done at week 1 and at week 14 end of study . eight 42.1 of the 19 patients who completed at least three iron infusions had a more than 1 g dl increase in their hb level . although the role of esas is well established in treating caa big concerns were recently raised about the negative effect of esas on survival in some patients with cancer.911 concerns about the risk for thromboembolism in patients with cancer with higher hb levels who are receiving esa were also addressed in many trials.2223 in addition the possible immunosuppressive effects of blood product transfusions that may have relevance to neoplasia progression were addressed before.24 25 in our pilot study we tested the feasibility of using iron supplementation alone to treat anemia in patients with cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy without the use of esas or blood transfusion which could be a valid alternative especially for patients with curable cancers . given that the mean hb increase using esas with iv iron in one large controlled trial was 2.4 g dl21 the results obtained in our study are clinically significant . these findings should be further confirmed and better assessed in larger studies in which questions such as the optimal timing of iv iron therapy with respect to chemotherapy and the optimal total dose of iv iron should be determined . published reviews report an increase in hepatocellular carcinoma only in patients with hemochromatosis after they develop cirrhosis.29 similarly data supporting the association between iv iron therapy and higher infection rate are weak and not well supported.30 in fact anemia itself is a risk factor for infections in patients receiving hemodialysis.31 a multivariate analysis of associations between iron and mortality in more than 58000 patients receiving hemodialysis reported no increased death rate from serum ferritin levels as high as 1200 ng ml.30 the increasing cost of therapy in patients with cancer is of grave concern which could be an additional benefit of iv iron over the use of esas in such patients . to further address many of the questions raised our team is planning a bigger trial for iv iron in patients with cancer who have anemia to confirm the results discussed in this pilot trial . iv iron therapy alone is safe and may be effective in improving hb levels in patients with cancer who are undergoing active anticancer therapy .", " tardive dystonia td a rarer side effect after longer exposure to antipsychotics is characterized by local or general sustained involuntary contraction of a muscle or muscle group with twisting movements generally slow which may affect the limbs trunk neck or face . td has been shown to develop in about 3 of patients who have had long term exposure to antipsychotics . this was interpreted as psychosis with persecutory ideas and he was treated with risperidone 2 mg day for 2 months and then with olanzapine 5 mg day for 4 months . in last two follow ups patient did not present himself and mother reported unusual neck movements which were taken as a part of his overall psychopathology and not taken seriously slight intermittent neck movements reported were missed as part of adolescent behavior problems mimicking some hero in movies . as neck dystonia increased the patient had a severe disability as patient had to keep his hands behind his head for the support . earlier case reports reported td developing with high dose atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine 20 mg or aripiprazole 15 mg with longer duration of exposure of around 1215 months in established psychiatric illness like schizophrenia or any other psychotic illness . this patient s severe dystonic neck movements developed within short period of 6 months of exposure to atypical antipsychotics risperidone 2 mg and then olanzapine 5 mg only which can cause minimal extrapyramidal side effects . this case highlights dangers of casually prescribing low dose second generation antipsychotics in patient with hyperthymic temperament and borderline intellectual functioning with vague short lasting presenting complaints probably misdiagnosed as psychosis leading to such severe adverse effects because patients with organic brain damage are more prone to develop adverse effects like td . thus judicious use of antipsychotics with detailed and frequent assessments is important and emergent stereotyped behavior or unexplained movements must be examined carefully and taken seriously .", " although immune pathways can be generally and non specifically inhibited by pesticides they also are a likely source of candidate molecules that could be inhibited for target specific insect control since multiple classes of insect immunity genes including signaling pathways can be under strong selection for diversification . as such the investigation of insect immune pathways and mechanisms of pathogen modulation can yield insights into components that may be susceptible to inhibition . much of our current knowledge of insect immune signaling pathways and receptor and effector function is based on the premiere model organism d. melanogaster for which there are extensive genetic tools and several fully sequenced genomes . based on these model insect systems a fairly detailed picture of immunity from pathogen detection to effector function is emerging though many gaps remain particularly with regard to components that are unique to different insect orders . here we review aspects of insect immunity with an emphasis on the similarities and distinctions between d. melanogaster and representative lepidoptera . their diversity and immune effector function as well as their variant representation among insects table 1 have made them a central focus in the study of invertebrate pathology 30 52 . bioinformatic and experimental data support the existence of the amp inducing toll and imd pathways in lepidopterans though not all components have been identified in model organisms such as m. sexta 32 35 . the conserved presence of amps in immunity coupled with the possibility that certain elements of their induction pathways may vary among insects enhances the probability that microbially induced amp expression could be inhibited in a pest specific manner . pgrps were subsequently shown to be conserved across mammals and insects and in d. melanogaster their role in the induction of amp gene expression through toll and imd pathways in response to pgn has been well documented 7983 . such a link is possible since pgn and 13glucan can activate amp gene expression in m. sexta and b. mori 8590 and multiple infection induced pgrp and grp encoding genes have been identified in lepidoptera 32 38 54 55 9194 . however there are numerous hints that lepidoptera and diptera may have evolved divergent mechanisms of linking pathogen detection to conserved toll and imd signal transduction cascades . also in contrast to the situation in d. melanogaster highly purified lps and lta are inducers of amp gene expression in lepidoptera though not as potently as crude lps with contaminating pgn or purified pgn 85 90 96 97 . this raises the possibility that different mamps or combinations of mamps are most efficacious in eliciting amp gene expression in lepidoptera relative to diptera . also since purified lps can elicit amp expression in lepidoptera but not d. melanogaster lepidoptera have either a distinct repertoire of prrs responsible for lps dependent triggering of imd or toll pathways or an as yet undiscovered pathway that links lps to amp induction . one class of lepidopteran prr that may mediate infection dependent induction of amps is the c type lectins ctls ca dependent secreted proteins that have carbohydrate binding capabilities . the potential role of the prrs discussed above in mediating the expression of amp genes remains to be determined and further study of the lepidoptera specific immune surveillance proteins and divergent activities of conserved prrs likely will yield novel avenues for pest control . some of the basic components of the toll pathway are present in lepidoptera figure 2 . despite the conservation of certain aspects of the toll pathway the extracellular cascades that lead to sptzle activation may have diverged between d. melanogaster and the two lepidoptera figure 1 . for example in contrast to what is known in d. melanogaster the m. sexta toll pathway is activated by gram negative associated mamps 115 118 . the findings reviewed above demonstrate that while the overall architecture of the toll pathway is conserved among insects the specific identities of proteolytic cascade members are distinct and many gaps remain in our understanding of toll activation in lepidoptera . filling these gaps should reveal potential lineage specific molecules that can serve as targets to hinder the activation of the toll pathway in agricultural pests . however few experiments have been done to characterize the molecular mechanisms leading to activation of the imd pathway in these insects . finally in the lepidopteran beet armyworm spodoptera exigua rnai mediated knockdown of relish expression resulted in loss of cecropin induction upon fungal infection further strengthening the idea that the imd pathway may contribute to amp gene expression in lepidoptera though perhaps it is triggered by distinct signals . further study is needed to elucidate imd mediated amp induction in lepidoptera and to reveal any differences there are in this pathway between diptera and lepidoptera . pgrps were subsequently shown to be conserved across mammals and insects and in d. melanogaster their role in the induction of amp gene expression through toll and

there are in this pathway between diptera and lepidoptera . however before such approaches can be realized the details of lepidopteran immune signaling pathways must be elucidated . the relatively large sizes of last instar larvae of many lepidopteran species will facilitate biochemical approaches to such studies while the establishment of immune inducible lepidopteran cell lines such as the uga cie1 cell line can enable the characterization of molecular mechanisms leading to imd pathway activation and its contribution to amp gene expression .", " cough syncope a rare form of syncope may be a result of transient failure of the cerebral autoregulatory mechanism to cope with sudden decrease in cerebral blood flow . based on the clinical features and eeg findings the episodes observed in our patient are most consistent with cough syncope . transient cerebral circulatory arrest has been demonstrated by transcranial doppler measurements during cough syncope . cough syncope has been associated with posterior fossa mass lesions or tonsillar herniation and with hydrocephalus . the authors postulate that cough syncope in these patients might be the result of delayed recovery from hypotension that follows a paroxysm of cough and this was likely contributing to global cerebral hypoperfusion in our patient . this case highlights the fact that cough syncope a rare form of syncope may be associated with intracranial mass lesions that indirectly exaggerate the increase in icp in response to cough . recurrent cough syncope should trigger search for factors including brain tumors with the potential to cause transient elevation in icp . this case also illustrates an important role for ceeg monitoring with video in distinguishing syncope from seizures in cough syncope cases .", " although mir210 has been shown to be involved in regulation of physiological processes in various diseases and to be an up regulated mirna in testes of noa patients it remains unknown how mir210

testicular tissues in the 3 groups and in nt2 cells . to clarify the location of igf2 in human testicular tissues we found igf2 located in spermatocytes in the testes of patients with oa figure 1 . because igf2 is located in spermatocytes of the testis we detected the expression of igf2 in cases with ma hypospermatogenesis and oa but not in the scos patients . we found that igf2 was down regulated in patients with ma and hypospermatogenesis compared to oa patients which was considered as the control group with normal spermatogenesis although without a significant difference figures 2 3 possibly because there were fewer samples and longer preservation times of some samples . quantitative real time pcr was performed to examined mir210 expression in the testis of patients with ma hypospermatogenesis and oa . we found that mir210 was significantly up regulated in the testis of ma and hypospermatogenesis patients compared to oa patients figure 4 . to clarify the location of igf2

mir210 expression . we found that mir210 was significantly up regulated in the testes of subjects with ma and hypospermatogenesis patients compared to oa . in the present study we found that igf2 was targeted by mir210 directly in the in vitro experiment in nt2 cells and mir210 might be associated with spermatogenesis by targeting igf2 in male infertility . we demonstrated that mir210 might be associated with spermatogenesis by targeting igf2 in male infertility .", " midwife led primary delivery care for low risk pregnant women during labor has been reported to have various advantages such as increased odds of high maternal satisfaction and a decrease of unnecessary medical interventions 18 . therefore safe midwife led delivery care with the backup of obstetricians may also be required for low risk pregnant women in japan . in our institute one of the main tokyo city perinatal centers there are 3 japanese systems of midwife led delivery care as follows 1 those intending to give birth at home managed by midwives who do not belong to our hospital 2 those planning to give birth on futons i.e. the objective of this study was to describe trends in transfers and perinatal outcomes among labors using these 3 japanese systems of midwife led primary delivery care . in our hospital pregnant women who are initially considered low risk at 3436 weeks of gestation can choose freely between the 3 systems of midwife led care and obstetric shared care . a retrospective study was performed to examine trends in transfers and perinatal outcomes among labors that started using the 3 systems of midwife led primary delivery care . the total rate of transfers in the system run by the midwives belonging to our hospital 56 was higher than in the other 2 systems run by the independent midwives 31 in planned home birth or 1.87 95 ci 1.23.0 p 0.01 38 in planned hospital birth or 2.51 95 ci 1.73.8 p 0.01 . table 3 shows the obstetric and neonatal outcomes in the pregnant women initially considered as low risk for receiving our midwife led primary delivery care systems . in this study there was no evidence that the primary midwife led care is unsafe for low risk pregnant women in any of these 3 midwife led delivery care systems .", " in spite of these limitations studies of type 2 diabetes and genetic factors of obesity can predict the risks for development of both type 2 diabetes and obesity in order to assist primary prevention and korea is an appropriate country for such studies because of the homogeneity of racial composition and lifestyle 25 . therefore the aim of this study was to analyze the presence of the enpp1 polymorphism not studied yet in korean population to identify the association between genotypes and allele with type 2 diabetes and obesity . we also investigated the differences in frequencies of genotypes between type 2 diabetic and normal groups and between obesity and normal groups by fisher s exact test . we also investigated the differences in frequencies of genotypes between type 2 diabetic and normal groups and between obesity and normal groups by fisher s exact test . we investigated the differences in age blood pressure bmi and results of clinical examinations according to genotypes of enpp1 k121q between the type 2 diabetic and non diabetic groups table 1 . the odds of a kqqq genotype were 0.93 for obese versus non obese subjects . there was no statistically significant difference in the distribution among these genotypes and alleles p0.81 p0.89 respectively although the 121q carrier and q allele in obese andor diabetics seemed to differ slightly from those in the non obese non diabetics reference group . after adjusting for the effects of obesity the probability of type 2 diabetes in kqqq type was 0.858 data not shown and that in q allele was 1.095 showing no significant difference table 5 . moreover after adjusting for the effects of type 2 diabetes the probability of developing obesity in the kqqq type was 0.936 data not shown and that in the q allele was 1.038 showing no significant difference table 6 . we carried out this study to investigate the association of k121q variants with type 2 diabetes and obesity in korean male workers . in the previous studies of the association between type 2 diabetes and polymorphism in enpp1 the k121q missense mutation increased the odds ratio or for type 2 diabetes in dominican 10 south asian caucasian 16 finnish 18 and french populations 24 . moreover according to a meta analysis of the association between enpp1 k121q variant and type 2 diabetes the odds ratios were 1.30 95 confidence interval ci 1.13 1.50 16 and 1.17 95 ci 1.10 1.25 19 showing significant association . in this study 121q was not associated with type 2 diabetes showing consistent results with those in the japanese population 5 danish caucasians 13 oji cree population 17 finnish population 18 and danish white subjects 19 . most type 2 diabetes in koreans is characterized by non obesity thus the enpp1 k121q mutant relevant to insulin resistance possibly could be a candidate gene that is not appropriate to explain susceptibility to type 2 diabetes . in previous studies of the association between obesity and polymorphism in enpp1 121q carriers andor q allele were associated with obesity in the chinese han population bmi of obesity group 27 kg m 3 caucasians bmi of obesity group 90th percentile african american adults bmi of obesity group 80th percentile 23 french population bmi of obesity group 95th percentile 24 and dominican population bmi of obesity group 30 kg m 10 . the results of the present study showed that the frequencies of the q allele was 8.7 in the type 2 diabetic group and 9.2 in the obesity group which was lower than those in finnish and swedish populations 12.9 15.1 11 danish caucasians 14 16 13 south asians in chennai 14 caucasians in dallas 16 south asians in dallas 19 16 the dominican population 54.2 10 and black children 77 30 . the frequencies of the q allele investigated in this study might have a smaller statistical power to explain any association with either type 2 diabetes or obesity with 121q carriers kqqq andor the q allele . in conclusion the present study suggests that the enpp1 k121q polymorphism was not associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity .", " when used in conjunction with statins and other lipid lowering drugs lipid apheresis may also induce the regression of coronary atherosclerotic plaque in familial hypercholesterolemia fh patients . lipid apheresis is an alternative form of treatment for these fh patients as well as those who have persistently elevated ldl levels despite treatment . because apheresis is performed at only a few highly specialized centers in relatively low volume there is very little literature discussing the effectiveness of lipid apheresis on the reduction of lipid profiles and the prevention of future cardiac events . this study therefore reports the experience in a single metropolitan center of treating patients with hyperlipidemia with lipid apheresis . retrospective chart reviews were performed and questionnaire surveys were given to active lipid apheresis patients at the minneapolis heart institute mhi at abbott northwestern hospital anw minneapolis minnesota . currently the fda supports ldl apheresis for patients who after six months do not have an adequate response to diet therapy and maximum drug therapy due to either ineffectiveness or intolerance and meet the following criteria functional homozygotes with an ldl cholesterol 500 mg dl without cad functional heterozygotes with ldl cholesterol 300 mg dl without cad functional heterozygotes with ldl cholesterol 200 mg dl with documented coronary heart disease . the date of birth gender date of apheresis initiation lipid disorder diagnosis apheresis frequency and family history of cardiac events were recorded . the patients self reported a total of 44 cardiac events before apheresis and 8 cardiac events after apheresis . this study was conducted to gain more information on lipid apheresis and evaluate the effectiveness in lowering lipid values . our study shows that apheresis markedly lowers total cholesterol ldl cholesterol triglycerides and to a much lesser degree hdl cholesterol . there was a small but statistically significant reduction in hdl values after apheresis . although taken from a small study population our data suggests a reduction in cardiac event rate after apheresis . in that period 7 out of 21 patients on apheresis had a cardiac event compared with 3 out of 21 on medication only . while this study found that apheresis arrested the progression of atherosclerosis the fh regression study found that ldl apheresis combined with simvastatin was more effective than colestipol plus simvastatin in reducing ldl cholesterol and lipoprotein a but was less effective at influencing coronary atherosclerosis . since lipid apheresis is an advanced treatment for an uncommon genetic disease the limited number of patients available to participate in the study led to a small sample size . the event rate reduction was not statistically significant but showed a strong trend toward cardiac event rate reduction before and after apheresis . lipid apheresis can reliably reduce ldl non hdl cholesterol triglyceride and total cholesterol levels in fh patients . our data suggest that lipid apheresis shows a strong but not statistically significant trend towards the reduction of cardiac events . apheresis is a viable treatment for fh patients especially those that are statin intolerant due to its lipid lowering nature and its apparent reduction of cardiac events .", " a 33year old male with no family history of thrombophilia who had experienced multiple recurrent episodes of dvt over a 15year period of unknown cause was admitted into our hospital because of cellulitis in the right leg . venous thromboembolism vte which includes deep vein thrombosis dvt and pulmonary embolism has an incidence of 1 to 3 per 1000 individuals per year in western populations.1 congenital anomalies of the inferior vena cava ivc are uncommon and have been associated with the development of venous thrombosis of the lower limbs.2 congenital anomalies of the ivc has been reported as a risk factor for dvt especially in individuals 30 years old and a concomitant thrombophilic disorder has been found in such individuals.3 we report a case of recurrent dvt in a 33year old man with agenesis of the ivc . the patient had experienced recurring episodes of idiopathic dvt in the right leg for 15 years . the patient was diagnosed as having agenesis of the infrarenal segment of the ivc and dvt of the right leg without concomitant risk factors for vte . since we attributed the agenesis of the ivc to be the underlying cause of the recurrent episodes of the dvts the patient was started on anticoagulant therapy subcutaneous enoxaparin 160 mg day for dvt antibiotic therapy intravenous vancomycin 1.5 g day for mrsa skin infection and referred to a vascular surgeon specialist but the patient refused .", " hence serum a appears suitable for use in predicting mci ad and optimal sensitivity and specificity is probably achievable if combined with current diagnostic procedures such as brief neuropsychological testing . in this study we examined the usefulness of brief neuropsychological tests in combination with blood a140 and a142 as a predictive test for detecting mci ad in at risk older adults at a pre symptomatic stage . the inclusion criteria for adapt subjects were age of 70 or older at enrollment a self reported family history of ad like dementia and normal cognitive performance on a brief battery of neuropsychological tests . timeframe from baseline cognitive testing to blood draw was 2.25 years 0.71 sd and from blood draw to diagnosis was 1.79 years 1.2 sd . due to significant intercorrelations between these tests analyses described below are limited to those baseline cognitive tests that were sensitive to early changes i.e. verbal learning and memory associated with mci ad or tests that were similar to those previously shown to be associated with a levels . of the 215 subjects who gave blood for the ancillary study two developed non ad dementia and of the remaining subject pool of 208 used in these analyses 28 subjects met criteria for either ad n 10 or mci n 18 in the two years following blood draw . differences among groups on demographic variables neuropsychological variables and serum a140 levels were examined using either the student s t test or analyses depending on the type of variable measurement . time updated cox regression modeling was used to test whether neuropsychological test scores a or a combination of both can predict conversion to mci ad in individuals who were cognitively normal at baseline . comparisons on variables between subjects who remained cognitively normal and those who declined over the short follow up period are reported in table 1 . only 23 of the cognitively normal individuals had serum a142 in the lowest quartile compared to the nearly 50 of the diagnostic group 44 of mci subjects and 50 of ad subjects . time dependent cox regression analyses were performed to examine the relationship between these cognitive tests and a on the prediction of subsequent conversion to mci ad . cox regression analyses show that the model using neuropsychological tests predicted mci ad 2 log likelihood 206.51 52.11 df 8 p .001 . the final full model adjusting for confound and the study medications included hvlt r fluency 3ms a142 levels and a142 quartiles 2 log likelihood 166.25 74.55 df 18 p .001 with fluency 3ms and a142 in the lowest two quartiles as significant individual predictors of mci ad in the model . for the 3ms scores among subjects who converted to mci ad those with a142 in the lowest quartile declined 1.83 1.28 sd as compared to the highest quartile 4.83 1.35 sd and this difference was statistically significant f 3.42 p .033 . for mci ad subjects with the lowest quartile of the a142a140 ratios the 3ms values remained ultimately unchanged 0.16 1.20 sd while the scores improved among those with the highest quartile of the a142a140 ratios 4.33 1.20 sd and these differences were also statistically significant f 3.10 p .046 . among individuals who remained cognitively normal while a similar pattern was observed those with lowest quartile of a142 and a142a140 ratios had a larger decline than those with the highest quartile for each hvlt r 0.28 0.27 sd versus . the combination of brief neuropsychological tests along with blood based biomarkers of ad represents a reasonable approach with a potential for wide scale use . our findings here provide support for this notion and demonstrate that early prediction of risk for developing mci ad may be feasible via a combination of brief neuropsychological tests and biomarkers in an at risk cohort . we have also shown that in subjects diagnosed with ad there is an association between measures of language tests of fluency and object naming and a140 and that memory performance is associated with serum a142 . collectively these findings suggest that combining cognitive tests with blood a may be useful for predicting future mci ad which to date has not been explored particularly as either a or the cognitive tests alone may not have the desired sensitivity or specificity for prediction of future mci ad . this current work presented here provides evidence that the combination of brief neuropsychological tests and blood a has potential utility in predicting mci ad at least 2 to 4 years prior to the clinical classification of mci or diagnosis of ad . although at present no studies have reported sensitivity and specificity of csf a142 in predicting mci ad conversion from normal cognition a large multicenter study has shown that csf a142 predicts transition from mci to ad while tau alone achieved a high sensitivity 83 with acceptable specificity 72 . it is interesting to note that our findings using blood and cognitive tests a far less invasive method resulted in higher sensitivities and specificities for predicting cognitive decline in at risk cognitively normal older adults . despite the limitation that blood sampling was not conducted at the same time point as the cognitive testing our data provide strong support for further evaluation of this approach particularly as we have not seen significant fluctuations in a levels over a one year period pers .", "", " previous studies have reported an association between nuclear catenin accumulation and melanoma progression and suggested nuclear catenin to be a marker of poor prognosis 1 7 . moreover clinical genetic and histological studies suggest that nuclear and cytoplasmic catenin may be used as biomarkers of good prognosis in melanoma 1114 . since the decrease loss of nuclear catenin 9 10 rather than increases as in breast cancer is linked to melanoma progression it is not known whether rad6 and catenin work in concert to promote melanoma pathogenesis . in this study we examined rad6 and catenin expressions in serial sections of nevi primary and metastatic melanomas to determine their potential roles in melanoma development and metastatic progression . our data suggest that membranous relocation of catenin and upregulation of rad6 are independent markers of melanoma development and progression . however significant differences were observed between the percentages of nevi 59 primary melanoma 90 and metastatic melanoma 56 that expressed catenin in more than 90 of the cells p 0.02 figure 2 . these differences were greatly impacted by the percentage of primary melanomas 48 that expressed catenin in 100 of the cells which was approximately twofold higher than the percentages of nevi 21 or metastatic melanoma 26 data not shown . concurrently with this increase the percentage of tumors that expressed cytoplasmic catenin decreased from nevi 90 to primary and metastatic melanomas 45 and 38 resp . in contrast no significant differences were observed between the percentages of primary and metastatic melanomas that expressed catenin at either the membrane 83 and 93 resp . the increase in tumor populations expressing rad6 from 37 of nevi to 100 of primary and metastatic melanomas was significant p 0.0001 figures 1 2 and 3 . there is a 2.7fold difference in the percentage of primary melanomas 100 expressing rad6 compared to nevi 37 and virtually no difference in catenin expression between primary and metastatic melanomas 100 . accordingly rad6 and catenin expressions in primary melanoma were not correlated r 0.001 p 0.99 . in this study we examined the association between rad6 and catenin expressions in benign and malignant melanocytic tumors to determine whether rad6 works in concert with catenin to influence melanoma development and progression . therefore we hypothesized that comparison of rad6 and catenin expressions in the same nevi and melanoma tumors would help determine whether these two signals collaborate to promote melanoma development and progression as they do in breast cancer 15 28 . however our results show that the expression levels of catenin do not contribute to melanoma initiation and progression since no difference in catenin levels was found between nevi primary melanoma and metastatic melanoma 9397 of all samples expressed catenin in 50 of the tumor cells . also our findings are in agreement with previous reports of positive catenin staining in nevi 100 and primary melanoma 95 94 but are higher than reported in metastatic melanoma 75 68 9 21 . previous studies have shown higher percentages of nuclear catenin in nevi than in melanoma 84 versus 33 and 44 versus 15 9 22 . in light of these data the absence of nuclear catenin in all the nevi and melanomas analyzed in our study was surprising . taken together the absence or negligible amount of nuclear catenin detected in the aforementioned studies as well as ours suggests possible extranuclear roles for catenin in nevi and melanoma . the percentage of cases that expressed catenin on the cell membrane increased dramatically from 10 in nevi to 83 and 93 in primary and metastatic melanomas respectively . concurrently the percentage of cases that expressed cytoplasmic catenin decreased from 90 in nevi to 45 and 39 in primary and metastatic melanomas respectively figure 4 . of note this hypothesis can explain how despite the abundant catenin expression in melanoma 1 7 cytoplasmic catenin is selectively decreased a phenomenon that has been associated with unfavorable melanoma prognosis 9 21 22 . however this direct positive correlation between catenin and rad6 expression does not appear to be conserved in melanoma as the expression profiles of catenin and rad6 differed considerably in nevi . at first glance it would appear that catenin and rad6 expressions are correlated in primary melanoma because these proteins were coexpressed in approximately all primary melanomas . however it is unlikely that the high rad6 expression in primary melanoma is driven by the concurrent high catenin expression because rad6 expression is low in nevi despite the presence of high cytoplasmic catenin expression that is comparable to primary melanoma . this notion is confirmed by lack of statistical correlation between rad6 and catenin expressions in primary melanoma . we also demonstrated that further progression of melanoma from primary to metastatic disease is not associated with a correlation between the catenin and rad6 expressions . taken together our study does not support a direct positive interaction between catenin and rad6 in either benign or malignant melanocytic tumors . we show that in contrast to rad6 catenin is expressed in more than 50 of the tumor cells in almost all nevi and melanoma tumors . taken together in contrast to the rad6 catenin positive relationship in breast cancer 1517 our study does not support a similar positive interaction between catenin and rad6 in benign or malignant melanocytic tumors .", " in dna 2deoxyguanosine dg mass m is the chief site for base oxidation due to its low redox potential leading to many products that are characterized by their mass signatures . the principal products characterized with one electron oxidants in aqueous solutions can be grouped based on the site of reaction on the radical intermediate resulting from one electron oxidation of dg . when the initial reaction occurs at c8 of dg either 26diamino4hydroxy5formamidopyrimidine fapy dg m 18 is observed under reducing conditions or 8oxo78dihydroguanine dog m16 is observed under oxidizing conditions in which the latter compound is a key marker for monitoring oxidative stress in cells scheme 1 . in the cellular context oxidation reactions with dg can have other nucleophilic participants such as amines or phenols . for example when dg is oxidized in the presence of lysine products retaining the dg heterocycle and those with a core similar to dgh or dsp have been observed . in the dg oxidation studies a spermine adduct at c8 is observed retaining the dg heterocyclic core while dog oxidations yield an adduct at c5 that does not undergo acyl migration to create a spirocycle but instead the polyamine can generate an unstable hemiaminal intermediate that decomposes leaving a ribosylurea lesion at the adduct formation site . in the current work oxidations that allowed dg to react with nh3 were conducted while the full product and diastereomer distributions were monitored . these results provide a fundamental understanding of the stability and base pairing properties of amine adducts to dg that result during oxidation which may occur in vivo due to the high concentration of nucleophilic amines in the vicinity of the genome . the unencumbered nucleoside dg 1 mm was chosen for the initial oxidation reactions where nh4cl 20 mm provided the source of nucleophilic nh3 . esi ms figure s1 supporting information and the adducts observed that did not involve participation of nh3 during product formation included dz m 21 dog m 16 dgh m 6 and dsp m 32 scheme 2 . ammonia adducts observed included two pairs of chromatographic peaks for the diastereomers of spirodiiminohydantoin2deoxyribonucleosides dsi whose names are based on the site of nh3 attachment to guanine thus 5dsi m 31 and 8dsi m 31 scheme 2 see reference cited for the correct dsi iupac nomenclature . the nucleosides dog and c8 amine adducted dg have redox potentials that are 600 mv below the parent nucleoside dg causing them to be much more susceptible to further oxidation . further one electron oxidized dog was observed to have an even lower redox potential than the parent compound dog which means that once oxidation of dog and likely 8amino dg occurs product formation is inevitable due to the 70 conversion to product that yielded the spirocyclic compounds dsp 5dsi or 8dsi . the adducts derived from the nucleophile trapping of electrophilic dg oxidation intermediates show nh3 participation through the products 5dsi 29 that was the highest yielding nh3 adduct followed by nearly 3fold less 8dsi 11 . the second oxidant studied was rose bengal a type ii photooxidant o2 that furnished 5dsi as the major product 62 followed by a 3fold lower amount of dsp 31 and low yields of dz 5 and dgh 2 were observed to complete the mass balance figure 3 . as expected this oxidant did not yield 8dsi based on its mechanism of oxidation . in the riboflavin oxidation dz was the major product while in the rose bengal oxidation 5dsi was the major product and these observations can be ascribed to each oxidant s unique mechanism of oxidation schemes 2 and 3 . product distributions from this oxidant included nearly equivalent distributions of dsp 50 and 5dsi 42 with the mass balance completed by dgh 8 figure 3 . the former work from our laboratory proposed that c8 amine adducts result from oxidation of the amine to the aminyl radical that adds at the c8 carbon of dg followed by oxidation leading to product formation scheme 4 . in nucleoside dg this proposed mechanism best supports the observation of ammonia adducts at c8 because upon one electron oxidation of dg the initial radical cation dg formed is very acidic pka 3.9 and rapidly deprotonates to the neutral radical dg that is not susceptible to nucleophilic attack . thus oxidation of lysine to an aminyl radical that adds to c8 of dg is possible with na2ircl6 0.9 v vs nhe ph 7 and riboflavin 1.7 v vs nhe ph 7 in contrast the analogous reaction does not readily occur for nh3 because at ph 7 dg is the dominant site of oxidation due to its lower redox potential leading to products other than 8dsi . in summary one electron oxidant driven oxidations of dg in the presence of nh3 lead to spirocyclic adducts at c5 and c8 that are in competition with h2o adducts of the same core structure . first both 5 and 8dsi were stable at ph 10 during this time frame while 5dsi readily hydrolyzed to dsp at ph 3 in 30 min and 8dsi hydrolyzed to dsp after 10 h. for 5dsi deamination of the amine group can occur by two possible mechanisms 1 a retro acyl migration can occur followed by loss of nh3 to yield an electrophilic intermediate dog susceptible to h2o attack followed by a second acyl migration back to dsp or 2 acid catalyzed deamination can occur directly to furnish dsp scheme 5 . upon incubation of one diastereomer of 5dsi at ph 3 only one diastereomer of dsp was observed supporting the direct deamination mechanism . moreover the early eluting 5 and 8dsi nh3 adducts decomposed to the early eluting dsp isomer and the late eluting adducts deaminated to the later eluting dsp isomer figure s6 supporting information . also for the 5dsi and 8dsi ammonia adducts nearly equal yields for the diastereomers were observed . as stated above the diastereomerically pure ammonia adduct samples were determined to decompose to give a single diastereomer of dsp therefore on the basis of hplc elution order the absolute configuration for the diastereomers of the two dsi constitutional isomers can be determined . the r and s assignments for the diastereomers of 8dsi are the opposite of those for the dsp and 5dsi isomers with the same geometric configuration of the spirocyclic ring due to a change in the cahn ingold the diastereotopic ammonia adducts were then probed by electronic circular dichroism spectroscopy ecd . the next step from the nucleoside studies was to explore the context dependence of nh3 adduct formation in single and double stranded odns ssodn and dsodn . a comparison between the contexts studied when dg was allowed to react with nh3 in the presence of the photooxidant riboflavin is provided in figure 5 . furthermore the increase in 8dsi yield from the dsodn oxidations further supports this product resulting from nucleophilic addition of nh3 at c8 leading to 8dsi and not the nh3 aminyl radical adding at c8 to yield the same product . these results clearly demonstrate a dependence on the reaction context in formation of dg oxidation products and nh3 adducts . a look at the distribution of diastereomers resulting from oxidation of the odn contexts gave nearly equal amounts of both r and s diastereomers . keeping this limitation in mind the oxidation of dg by riboflavin initially yields dg that rapidly deprotonates to dg in the nucleoside contexts pka 3.9 dominating the product forming step of the reaction . upon ion exchange hplc purification the absolute stereochemical assignments for the dsp isomers have been established for the odns and those for 5dsi are assigned in this work to be analogous based on the mechanism of deamination discussed above see figure s7 supporting information for more details . the present studies mapped the pathways and quantified the products observed when dg was allowed to react with nh4cl in the presence of the photooxidants riboflavin and rose bengal as well as the one electron oxidant na2ircl6 . oxidations of dg in the nucleoside ss and dsodn contexts with photochemically activated riboflavin demonstrated three major context effects 1 the yield of dz was highest in the nucleoside studies and decreased dramatically in dsodn contexts 2 when nh3 participated as the nucleophile 5dsi was obtained in the highest yield in nucleoside studies while the yield of 8dsi was highest in dsodn contexts and 3 when h2o was the nucleophile in nucleoside reactions dsp presented in the highest yield while in dsodn contexts dgh was obtained in the highest yield figure 4 . furthermore a combination of mapping the decomposition pathways of the dsi compounds to dsp in which the absolute configuration has been assigned allowed the determination of the absolute configurations for the diastereomers of 5 and 8dsi . the dgh diastereomers were previously characterized by nmr dz was also previously characterized by nmr and the dsp diastereomers have been characterized by x ray crystallography . structural characterization of 5dsi and 8dsi by nmr was not conducted because of the instability of these compounds toward deaminating to dsp and the lack of nonexchangeable protons on the ring of either ammonia adducts makes them very challenging for structural analysis . furthermore if deamination of either 5dsi or 8dsi to dsp occurs in the nmr tube during analysis the peaks observed would be similar and challenging to interpret therefore the best method for obtaining structural data on the diastereomers of 5dsi and 8dsi is via the esi ms ms that was conducted figure 2 and provided satisfactory results to determine their structures . r5dsi tr 9 min lc esi ms m z m h calcd 299.3 found 299.3 hrms esi tof m

communities in the philippines questioning the economic advantages of its use . many researchers have correlated the extent of direct and indirect pesticide exposure and health hazards such as increased mortality dermal contamination depression in cholinesterase level fetal abnormalities and spontaneous abortion among pregnant women 36 . pesticide poisoning is one of the most prevalent health problems in the philippines . this study aimed to identify the pesticide exposure and risk factors among vegetable farmers . this was a cross sectional study to investigate the prevalence of pesticide exposure and its risk factors . details included personal information health history pesticide usage work practices work conditions risk factors associated with pesticide exposure and health data 2 exposure assessment monitoring on work conditions work practices and pesticide concentration 3 work analysis in each farm was also done to validate work practices related to pesticide preparation and application . the pesticide exposure of the farmers measured in table 4 as dependent variable was related to the amount of pesticide used in liters frequency of use and duration of use . those who used more pesticides over a longer period of time had higher total pesticide exposure . furthermore a farmer who was a pesticide applicator mixer loader and who wiped sweat with contaminated piece of fabric and who had not been given instructions through training association was at risk of having higher pesticide exposure . the results of this study identified pesticide exposure and farming practices of farmers in the largest vegetable producing area in the philippines . organophosphates carbamates and pyrethroid pesticides were the most commonly used type of pesticides among the farmers in this study . the farmers in this study used pesticides in their farms with a mean application time of 3.47 hours mean 3.47 2.09 . the study also showed certain risk factors associated with pesticide exposure such as re entering recently sprayed area spraying against the wind use of damaged backpack sprayer spills on the back spills while mixing pesticides among others . aside from direct pesticide use the different agricultural tasks mentioned above may also contribute as risk factors to pesticide exposure . this study has shown the pesticide exposure of farmers in the largest vegetable producing area in the philippines . the study showed that pesticide use is prevalent among farmers in benguet which is the largest vegetable producer in the philippines . it is also suggested that chronic effects of pesticide cited in certain studies 31 32 such as carcinogenic effects poor reproductive outcomes neurologic and respiratory disorders impairments of the immune system and birth defects should also be investigated in future studies . this manuscript adds to existing literature on pesticide exposure in the philippines which are so far mainly descriptive in nature . this paper also identifies risk factors such as work practices and designs of containers sprayers that may increase pesticide exposure among farmers . this also calls

prevalence of t2d has increased especially among cuban americans who have a higher incidence of diabetes 8.2 compared with 6.6 of non hispanic whites.10 the high incidence of t2d combined with an increased risk for developing diabetes complications warrants further examination of the cuban american population . screening for mau can detect individuals at risk for renal dysfunction and cvd events and possibly reduce the burden associated with diabetes complications . therefore the purpose of this study was to investigate to what degree the coexistence of htn and poor gc influences the likelihood of having mau among cuban americans with t2d . it was hypothesized that individuals with t2d htn and poor gc will have an increased likelihood to test positive for mau . poor gc was defined

j mice with either proteolytically active or inactive e64blocked der p 1 over a 6wk period showed a statistically significant enhancement in total ige p 0.01 and der p 1specific ige p 0.02 responses in animals immunized with proteolytically active der p 1 . this effect was ige specific as der p 1specific igg igg1 and igg2b responses increased to the same extent with proteolytically active or inactive der p 1 fig . however the ige restricted enhancement seen in response to immunization with proteolytically active der p 1 does suggest a mechanism that is unique to ige isotype switching synthesis . suppression of total ige p 0.04 and der p 1specific ige p 0.05 productions was also obtained when the proteolytic activity of der p 1 was blocked with iodoacetamide another sulfhydryl reactive agent . our results are direct evidence that the cysteine protease activity of der p 1 induces a significant increase in ige responses . such an effect is clearly consistent with the ability of der p 1 to proteolytically cleave mouse cd25 and induce a th2 response by modulating the balance between il4 and ifn 13 . on the other hand exploring the potential th2 adjuvant property of the proteolytic activity of der p 1 would have important implications in defining principles for modulation of th1mediated pathological conditions . in other words the proteolytic activity of der p 1 may exert an ige specific adjuvant effect . the in vivo relevance of the proteolytic activity of der p 1 is further highlighted by reports demonstrating that it increases the permeability of the human respiratory epithelium to macromolecules 1516 . such observations together with our current findings showing a direct effect on the immune system indicate that the proteolytic activity of der p 1 is a major contributor to its allergenicity .", " given the risk of paralysis associated with cervical transforaminal injection is it time to reconsider transforaminal injections of the lumbar spine arguments for discontinuing lumbar injections have been discussed in the anesthesia literature raising concern about the risks of epidural steroid injections esis . we conducted a search of the pubmed database of articles from 2002 to 2011 containing the following keywords complications lumbar epidural steroid injections cauda equina syndrome conus medullaris infarction spinal cord infarction spinal cord injury paralysis paresis plegia paresthesia and anesthesia . the patient reported that he had previously received esis on the left side of his lower back this was the second injection in a series of 3 . correct needle placement in the left l5s1 neural foramen was verified with epidurography immediately after the injection the patient felt his legs going dead paraplegia of the lower extremities was noted . however a second mri study to evaluate the possibility of vascular complications obtained 48 hours after the injection showed a conus infarct fig . magnetic resonance images about 48 hours after the procedure showing extensive signal abnormalities within the lower thoracic spinal cord and conus compatible with the clinical diagnosis of conus infarct . our search of the pubmed database 20022011 included the keywords complications lumbar epidural steroid injections cauda equina syndrome conus medullaris infarction spinal cord infarction spinal cord injury paralysis paresis plegia paresthesia and anesthesia . recent case reports of post procedural conus medullaris syndrome after spinal vascular compromise raise the question regarding safety . in 5 other case reports table 1 this complication affected patients aged 4271 years who had previous lumbar surgery and then underwent a transforaminal steroid injection . of the proposed mechanisms by which spinal cord medullary infarction may occur one explanation may be the combined effect of an undetected direct arterial injection into a low lying artery of adamkiewicz and the resultant embolic incident from the injectate . considering this observation we believe that it is unlikely that our patient had this low lying artery that could have then been injected with an epidural steroid at this precise location . another plausible explanation is that an inadvertent sacral radicular artery injection carried injection material distally to the spinal cord . given the risk of paralysis associated with cervical transforaminal injection is it time to reconsider transforaminal injections of the lumbar spine although the risk of permanent neurologic deficit is negligible arguments for discontinuing lumbar injections have been presented in the anesthesia literature . however we speculate that more than 6 cases of conus medullaris syndrome after esi have occurred and medicolegal considerations may explain why they may go unreported .", "", " because of apoe s essential genetic and therefore presumably biochemical contribution to ad pathology and cognitive decline it is critical that its role in the ad pathogenic pathway amyloid cascade be elucidated in order for therapeutics based on apoe to be designed . while recent excellent and encyclopedic literature reviews describe the many potential roles that apoe plays in ad 2326 this focused review will concentrate on the interaction between a and apoe and other inflammatory proteins on the effects of such interactions and on their implications for designing apoe based ad therapies . to determine whether inflammation contributes to alzheimer s disease rather than being merely a correlative pathological feature in the ad brain we and others tested the hypothesis that act andor apoe serve as amyloid catalysts or pathological chaperones . numerous in vitro and in vivo studies showed that mature amyloid deposition and the associated cognitive decline is strongly stimulated by apoe and act in a dose dependent and isoform specific manner with apoe4 being the strongest promoter of a polymerization and apoe2 being an inhibitor paralleling the effect of these two isoforms in humans 2738 . finally jones and colleagues recently showed that apoe4 also promotes the conversion and enhanced synaptic localization of a as oligomers the most neurotoxic form of the alzheimer amyloid peptide 40 41 . these recent studies extended prior work showing that apoe copurifies with a during biochemical isolation of amyloid from human brains and that apoe preferentially interacts with a peptides in a sheet structure 4245 . together these results show that inflammatory proteins particularly apoe are integral parts of the amyloid cascade and that without them the cascade would be arrested at the level of the harmless a monomer and no ad would ensue . the view of apoe as an integral and pathological part of the amyloid cascade has been shaken by experiments that suggest that apoe far from being an amyloid catalyst serves to clear a from the brain . contrary to expectations amyloid deposition in these mice was inhibited by the human apoe transgene as though human apoe was protective . it was proposed that human apoe might serve to inhibit a clearance from the brain compared to mouse apoe with apoe4 inhibiting clearance the most . the possibility that interaction with apoe modulated an a clearance mechanism appeared to be supported by the finding that introduction of anti a antibodies or other abinding proteins such as gelsolin led to a reduced amyloid load in the brain and rapidly improved cognition with little evidence of abinding agents invading the brain parenchyma 4154 . we also introduced apoe itself into the circulation via parabiosis and found that it induced amyloid clearance without entering the brain in ad model mice . if on the other hand apoe is involved in a clearance with human apoe4 being a greater inhibitor of clearance or poorer clearer then reducing apoe levels or apoe binding to a should increase amyloid deposition and cognitive decline . all experiments carried out so far in vitro or in transgenic mice indicate that the ability of a to form neurotoxic filaments or oligomers and cause cognitive decline are increased in the presence of apoe particularly mouse apoe and human apoe4 with apoe2 being protective . in contrast in the complete absence of apoe the mutant app gene and its product a are harmless generating neither amyloid deposits synaptic disfunction or cognitive decline with one copy of apoe having an intermediate effect as discussed above . most recently earlier work showing that mice expressing only one apoe gene accumulated less amyloid than those with two apoe genes 32 was repeated in two different laboratories using human apoe knock in mice and the same result was found that is lower doses of apoe3 or apoe4 led to reduced amyloid deposition 59 60 . the simplest interpretation of the in vitro cell culture and transgenic mouse data is that apoe is necessary for a to polymerize into neurotoxic oliogomers filaments probably by binding to a and thus altering its structure more toward the sheet and more easily allowing successive a peptides to add on to the growing chain . the ability of different apoe isoforms to bind a with different strengths can also explain why human apoe isoforms slow amyloid deposition in the presence of the endogenous mouse apoe for they may bind a more tightly or differently than mouse apoe and slow the catalytic conversion of a into oligomers polymers in the mouse background . the role of apoe and act in the alzheimer pathogenic pathway has potentially general implications . in sum it appears that the preponderance of the data can be most consistently interpreted as showing that the brain inflammatory protein apoe plays a catalytic role in the ad ds amyloid cascade and consequent cognitive decline with binding and clearance differences between the apoe isoforms reflecting their differing abilities to bind to a and catalyze its conversion into neurotoxic macromolecular species figure 2 .", " the aim of this article is to present some of the most frequent musculoskeletal disorders of the elderly including some misleading presentations . fractures are frequent in the elderly and result mainly from the effects of falls and osteoporosis . the main radiographic features of osteoporosis are increased radiolucency and cortical thinning mainly in the spine giving rise to a well demarcated outline of the vertebral body which has been described as picture framing. besides in the spine an increased biconcavity of the vertebral end plates with a protrusion of the intervertebral disk into the vertebral body can be observed . they often appear as multiple fractures with anterior wedging and may be associated with significant deformity leading to kyphosis . the latter imaging modality may be indicated in case of associated neurological symptoms a rare event or when a vertebroplasty is discussed in order to better localize

episodic migraine has been well established in the literature psychiatric disorders have been less studied in cm . only a few studies have addressed psychiatric comorbidities of cm in population based samples finding increased levels of depression and anxiety disorders even in comparison with episodic migraine patients 11 20 . a similar rate was described in the american migraine prevalence and prevention ampp study a population based survey based on mailed questionnaires . one interesting result from the ampp study was that cm patients were twice as likely to have depression as assessed by phq9 in comparison with episodic migraine patients 30.2 and 17.2 respectively or 95 ci 2.0 1.67 to 2.40 p 0.001 . the international burden of migraine study ibms also found higher levels of anxiety

the risk of psychiatric comorbidities once more pointing to shared biological factors as a plausible mechanism for the comorbidity 22 24 . in conclusion the present study suggests that psychiatric comorbidity in cm is elevated in the community and clinical settings tending to be more common in cm patients from a headache center .", " we have previously developed a monoclonal antibody against m1dg and incorporated the antibody into analytical schemes using immunoaffinity purification of m1dg followed by mass spectrometric detection . subsequent investigations into the metabolism and elimination of m1dg revealed that administration of m1dg to rodents at doses from 8 mg kg to 6 pg kg leads to its rapid disappearance from plasma due to oxidation and formation of the single stable metabolite 6oxo m1dg 32deoxyd erythro pentofuranosylpyrimido12purine6103h5hdione . all studies of m1dg metabolism in vivo have been conducted with exogenously administered deoxynucleoside . thus it is not known if 6oxo m1dg is actually present in unadulterated intact animals . in order to address this question we developed a highly specific monoclonal antibody mab against 6oxo m1dg and covalently linked the antibody to sepharose beads . the resultant antibody sepharose matrix the gel was used for the immunoaffinity purification of 6oxo m1dg from urine and feces followed by lc ms ms quantification against the stable isotope labeled internal standard n56oxo m1dg . utilizing this method we report for the first time that 6oxo m1dg is endogenously produced in rodents and is excreted in urine and feces . 6oxo m1guo was purified on biotage sp1 flash chromatography system biotage uppsala sweden using the following gradient 1 to 5 acetonitrile in 30 column volumes followed by a 5 to 15 gradient in 10 column volumes . aliquots of murine serum dilutions hybridoma supernatants or purified antibody depending on the stage of the antibody development process were then incubated in the coated wells with or without the addition of varying concentrations of 6oxo m1dg and structural analogues figure 1 in a final volume of 100 l pbs for 60 min at 37 c . for wells that included 6oxo m1dg or structural analogues the serum dilution used was 15000 in pbs tween b and the compounds depicted in figure 1 were preincubated in the dilute murine serum for 45 min prior to the serum addition step . this allowed the nonspecific antibodies to bind the structural analogues theoretically leaving behind only 6oxo m1dg specific antibodies . 6oxo m1dg m1dg and structural analogues that were used as competitive antigens during elisa analysis of murine sera hybridomal supernatant and purified antibodies . purified anti6oxo m1dg mab was loaded onto pd10 columns ge healthcare equilibrated with 25 ml coupling buffer 0.1 m nahco3 0.5 m nacl ph 8.0 in water . 6oxo m1dg was quantitated by stable isotope dilution against n56oxo m1dg . competitive elisa screenings were executed to assess antibody specificity with 6oxo m1dg and a series of structural analogues figure 1 serving as competing antigens . figure 3 depicts a competitive elisa analysis of the 35week serum from mouse balb cj r. this analysis employed 6oxo m1dg as the competing antigen and a robust concentration dependent decrease in optical density is observed indicating the presence of anti6oxo m1dg antibodies in the sera from this mouse . increasing amounts of m1dg do not result in a decrease in optical density indicating that m1dg does not bind to the anti6oxo m1dg antibodies present in the sera . 6oxo m1dg antibodies are present in the serum of mouse balb cj r. the serum of mouse balb cj r was subjected to competitive elisa analysis with 6oxo m1dg used as the competitor . figure 5 shows the elisa responses of the mab purified from 6c9ba4c12 in the presence of 6oxo m1dg and structural analogues . purified antibodies from the hybridomal subclone 6c9ba4c12 were screened for specificity for 6oxo m1dg in the presence of structural analogues using competitive elisa analyses . the purified anti6oxo m1dg mab was covalently linked to sepharose beads as described above . thus the gel was able to bind 6oxo m1dg from an aqueous solution and released the analyte in the presence of methanol . additionally the lc ms ms system provided a linear response to 6oxo m1dg solutions over a 5000fold concentration range and a single n56oxo m1dg concentration supporting information f bottom . these results indicate that the gel provided a sufficient level of recovery of the analyte and its internal standard as well as sufficient capacity for the expected levels of 6oxo m1dg present in rat urine and feces . 6oxo m1dg was detected in urine from only one subject animal 3 at a rate of 188 fmol kgd . however 6oxo m1dg was eliminated in feces in all the animals at a rate of 3501893 fmol kgd . while the amounts of 6oxo m1dg are low the assay provided a sufficient signal to noise ratio to permit accurate quantification . a representative lc ms ms chromatogram of 6oxo m1dg and the internal standard n56oxo m1dg isolated from rat feces is displayed . a major contributor to the low levels of m1dg is its oxidative metabolism to 6oxo m1dg . in the present manuscript we describe the generation of a monoclonal antibody that exhibits sensitive and specific binding to 6oxo m1dg and its use in a quantitative assay suitable for analysis of urine and feces . in the assay the sepharose bound mab is used to isolate 6oxo m1dg from urine and feces . the purified sample is subjected to lc ms ms analysis where 6oxo m1dg is quantified via stable isotope dilution against the synthetic internal standard n56oxo m1dg which is introduced to the sample prior to antibody purification . the antibody gel shows excellent recovery of 6oxo m1dg from buffer solutions . these data demonstrate that 100 l of the antibody gel is able to bind at least 26 pmol of 6oxo m1dg from solution and lc ms ms detection of the purified sample is quantitative . although there was minimal cross reactivity of the antibody with individual members of a panel of exocyclic adducts and purine oxidation products figures 1 and 5 it is possible that high levels of low avidity nucleosides in urine and feces compete with the low levels of endogenous 6oxo m1dg for binding sites on the mab . 6oxo m1dg was detected in the feces of each of three different sprague dawley rats but was detected in the urine of only one of the rats table 2 . because 6oxo m1dg is present endogenously in rats it suggests that its metabolic precursor m1dg is also produced endogenously in rats and metabolized to 6oxo m1dg . this idea is consistent with the finding that m1dg is present in rodent and human genomic dna and with studies from this laboratory demonstrating that 6oxo m1dg is the sole metabolite of m1dg . the ability to measure excreted 6oxo m1dg has the potential for clinical relevance in assessing the levels of oxidative dna damage in humans .", " before and after infusion the serum magnesium levels were checked . after magnesium therapy she felt very good about her pain and the vas of allodynia was reduced to 40 50 . for more accurate and safe delivery of magnesium to the target site we applied magnesium using the transforaminal epidural injection technique . to our knowledge no previous report has described about the magnesium administration by the transforaminal epidural route in patients with neuropathic pain . intravenous administration of magnesium is efficacious in the management of various conditions associated with neuropathic pain including phn . neuraxial administration of magnesium is an off label use and the safety of this technique in human subjects is still undetermined . however comparison with previous reports regarding intravenous magnesium administration suggested that the low dose epidural magnesium used in our patient was unlikely to result in systemic effects

diabetes1920 uveitis21 retinal vasculitis22 choroidal masses2324 retinal detachment25 and retinopathy of prematurity.26 the aim of this study was to evaluate a possible association between peripheral retinal nonperfusion obtained with uwfa and the number of intravitreal ranibizumab injections needed in patients with crvo . inclusion criteria were diagnosis of crvo as revealed by retinal hemorrhages and dilated retinal veins in all four quadrants of the fundus with active center involving macular edema and central subfield thickness 250 m detected by spectral domain optical coherence

9.323.84 intravitreal ranibizumab injections p0.001 mann whitney u test . there was a significant positive correlation between the size of peripheral retinal nonperfusion measured in terms of disc areas and the number of injections in each group . applying uwfa we found a significant correlation between the total number of intravitreal ranibizumab injections and the size of nonperfusion in the peripheral retina crvo patients with peripheral retinal nonperfusion received more intravitreal injections for treatment of their macular edema than patients without peripheral retinal nonperfusion . this observation could explain the requirement for more frequent intravitreal anti vegf injections of in crvo patients with macular edema and peripheral retinal nonperfusion . this finding is important because an evaluation of the peripheral retina using uwfa may be a prognostic factor and allows the ophthalmologists to estimate the requirement for more or fewer intravitreal injections based on the peripheral retinal perfusion status . interestingly the lack of observed neovascularizations in any of the patients even with extended areas of peripheral retinal nonperfusion might be attributed to good patient compliance strict follow up visits every 4 weeks and immediate treatment in case of detected macular edema . we calculated the mean size of peripheral retinal nonperfusion for all enrolled patients which was five disc areas and then the patients were divided into two groups according to that cut off point .", " it can be chronic or acute and can range from a nuisance to

also of concern to bariatric surgeons . multiple defects in the mesentery of the bowel can occur and may lead to ih and in an antecolic bypass a defect is associated with the roux limb passing over the transverse colon . the reported incidence of sbo after lgb varies widely perhaps because the technique used in the operation also varies widely not only in placement of the roux limb but regarding closure or nonclosure of the mesenteric defects . the objective of this study was to examine the incidence and characteristics of sbo after antecolic antegastric bypass with nonclosure of the mesenteric defect of the jejunojejunal jj anastomosis . sbo in 4 cases was caused by ih incidence of 1.6 and by adhesions in 11 73 figure 1 . the surgical literature has many articles that discuss ih formation and an area of contention has been closure versus nonclosure of the mesenteric defects . most authors seem to agree that if a retrocolic gastric bypass is performed the mesocolic defect must be closed which can lead to a 0 rate of ih formation although that number can climb as high as 15 . cho et al had a 0.2 ih formation rate in 1 400 patients who underwent antecolic antegastric bypasses with no mesenteric closure and no division of the mesentery . in 2010 in jsls hope and colleagues examined the incidence of ih formation after documented closure of mesenteric defects . permanent sutures were used to close these defects but 15 of 18 patients in the series presented with open defects causing ih . in this study the author specifically examined the incidence and cause of sbo in antecolic antegastric bypasses . this outcome compares favorably with the ih formation rate reported by other authors who did or did not close the defects . also the incidence of sbo caused by adhesions is higher in the current study than in some others . the author lives in a geographically isolated part of the country with no other surgeons who are willing to care for bariatric patients and so it was more likely that all the sbos would be treated by the same bariatric surgeon . the incidence of sbo caused by ih with nonclosure of the mesenteric defect is similar to that in other series where the defect was closed . regardless of the cause of the sbo operation remains the definitive treatment and should not be delayed in the gastric bypass patient .", " an entry hole was created at the center of the distal femur and proximal tibia for the insertion of the cement rod . the proximal medullary canal of the tibia was filled with antibiotic impregnated cement up to the surface of the proximal tibia while the surgical assistant maintained proper anatomic alignment and joint space . the space between the cement of the distal femur and the proximal tibia was filled with more antibiotic impregnated cement . the cement rod and static spacer provide a stable gap between the femur and tibia thereby minimizing soft tissue contracture and shortening of the lower limb . during the conduct of the antibiotic impregnated cement rod technique antibiotic impregnated cement was applied to the proximal tibia distal femur joint gap space suprapatellar pouch and both gutters in a stepwise manner . this technique enables easy removal of the cement and reduced soft tissue adhesion at second stage reimplantation .", " mental fatigue is common and can be a disabling long time condition following a stroke . even for those with an almost recovered stroke and without neurological and neuropsychological impairments the person who suffers from mental fatigue is able to perform mental effort just for short periods and notably it will take longer than normal to regain energy after being exhausted . few investigations have been carried out to evaluate fatigue and cognitive functions following a stroke . with the intention to increase knowledge about mental fatigue and cognitive difficulties related to stroke we examined well rehabilitated stroke participants who had suffered from long term mental fatigue for at least one year prior to examination . twenty four participants having recovered from neurological symptoms but suffering from pathological mental fatigue for at least one year following a stroke and 24 healthy controls were included in the study . the self assessment for mental fatigue is a multidimensional questionnaire containing 15 questions and is adapted from rdholm et al . the self assessment scale for mental fatigue and related items has been evaluated and the 14 questions had adequate internal consistency with a cronbach s alpha of 0.94 . the questions concern fatigue in general lack of initiative mental fatigue mental recovery concentration difficulties memory problems slowness of thinking sensitivity to stress increased tendency to become emotional irritability sensitivity to light and noise and decreased or increased duration of sleep as well as 24hour variations . all the separate items in the self assessment scale for mental fatigue were rated significantly higher for the stroke group compared to controls . there was a highly significant difference between the groups on their self assessment of mental fatigue with a mean value of 18 reported for the almost recovered stroke group and a mean value of four for the control group . it should be noticed that stroke victims were included due to the presence of mental fatigue during one year or more following the stroke . accordingly we suggest mental fatigue and depression to be independent phenomena following a stroke . in this study physically well recovered stroke subjects who had no medical problems except long term mental fatigue also showed decreased information processing speed and made more errors in demanding cognitive tasks compared to the control subjects . few studies have been carried out which cover fatigue and cognitive performance following a stroke . this is important as mental fatigue and cognitive deficits will be an obstacle to almost recovered stroke subjects who are on their way to a return to work and previous activities as every day life today is complex with high demands being placed on simultaneous and rapid decisions . in conclusion mental fatigue is disabling for many people following an almost recovered stroke and this is suggested to be related to cognitive impairments primarily information processing speed and attention .", " in addition our previous study suggested that krg exerts a cytoprotective effect through the induction of heme oxygenase ho1 expression suggesting a possible therapeutic mechanism of krg in cardiovascular diseases . accumulating evidence suggests that krg is involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses suggesting an anti inflammatory effect of krg . the objective of our study was to investigate the vascular protective effect of krg in acrolein stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells huvecs . to clarify whether krg mediated inhibition of acrolein induced cox2 expression plays a significant role in cytoprotection against oxidative stress acrolein stimulated cells were pretreated with krg 1 mg ml or untreated and cell death was measured by in situ terminal transferase dutp nick end labeling tunel assay . a previous study found that acrolein in cs induces cox2 expression in human endothelial cells . krg inhibited acrolein induced cox2 protein expression in a concentration dependent manner fig . after pretreatment of acrolein stimulated cells with krg the cells were fixed and cox2 localization in huvecs was observed by immunofluorescence staining with an anti cox2 antibody followed by a fluorescence tagged secondary antibody . immunofluorescence analysis showed that acrolein induced cox2 protein levels were inhibited in huvecs after treatment with krg fig . this result indicates that krg leads to the reduction of cox2 protein expression and subsequently pge2 biosynthesis in acrolein stimulated huvecs . these results indicate that krg may play a role in the inhibition of cox2 expression via reduction of acrolein generated ros in acrolein stimulated huvecs . thus to determine the upstream signaling pathway involved in krg mediated cox2 inhibition we measured the activation of p38 and creb by detecting increased phospho p38 and phospho creb levels in acrolein stimulated cells and found that phosphorylation of p38 and creb was strongly reduced by krg in acrolein stimulated cells fig . these results revealed that the vascular protective effect of krg is mediated by the inhibition of cox2 expression in acrolein stimulated huvecs . in this study we explored the inhibition of an inflammatory mediator cox2 by krg water extract in huvecs . we found that krg inhibited both mrna and the protein level of cox2 and its cytoprotective effect in acrolein stimulated huvecs . however there have been no reports revealing the mechanism underlying krg inhibited cox2 expression in acrolein unsaturated aldehydes in cs stimulated huvecs . p38 mapk creb and intracellular ros generation are involved in this inhibition of cox2 expression in acrolein stimulated huvecs by krg . as mentioned above therefore the inhibition of cox2 expression following krg water extract treatment may be associated with its strong protective effect in acrolein stimulated huvecs . in conclusion we propose that the krg water extract may exert a cytoprotective effect through the inhibition of cox2 induction and that this reduction of cox2 in acrolein stimulated huvecs is mediated by the p38 mapk", "

clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats protospacer adjacent motif single nucleotide polymorphism syringyl to guaiacyl lignin ratio since the first report of its programmable gene editing potential the crispr cas9 technology is revolutionizing all facets of biology from medicine to agriculture jinek et al . with its efficiency and simplicity crispr cas9 has quickly displaced its predecessors e.g. for agricultural applications that have traditionally depended on gene silencing for rna modification crispr cas9 is a game changer . this necessitates screening and characterization of a large number of transgenic lines for the desired trait . with biallelic editing null mutations are readily obtained in primary transformants though with varying efficiencies brooks et al . 2014 2015 interestingly the most efficient and consistent crispr cas9 editing was reported in hybrid populus tremula x alba clone 717 1b4 717 with biallelic mutations detected in all independent transgenic lines examined zhou et al . for woody perennials such as forest trees fruit nut trees and woody ornamentals with highly heterologous genomes and long generation times crispr cas9 affords a facile means to accelerate genetic improvement . the first application of crispr cas9 genome editing in populus targeted the 4coumarate coa ligase 4cl gene family involved in phenylpropanoid metabolism zhou et al . thus crispr cas9 editing of 4cl1 served as a proof of concept study allowing an assessment of its efficacy in perturbing lignin biosynthesis relative to previous methods . as frequently reported for crispr cas9 genome editing small indels especially 1bp modifications were the predominant patterns and predicted to disrupt the reading frame . by contrast the homogeneity of wood discoloration both within and across independent crispr cas9edited populus mutant lines is consistent with a null 4cl1 and resembles that of naturally occurring brown midrib mutants of maize and sorghum sattler et al . the results serve as testament to the superiority of crispr cas9 over previous gene silencing methods . after our initial publication successful crispr cas9 editing was reported for populus tomentosa fan et al . the lower mutation rates compared to our study may be attributed to gene redundancy and sequence heterozygosity that were not accounted for during grna design see discussion below . 2015 providing additional support for the superior phenotypic uniformity of crispr cas9 mutants . a major concern in genome editing is the specificity of the dna modification as off target cleavage due to non specific crispr cas9 activity may cause unintended mutations . we assessed crispr cas9 specificity in populus by analyzing its on target versus off target activities among duplicated genes . no off target cleavage in the 4cl5 locus was detected in 4cl1edited lines suggesting that crispr cas9 editing in populus is highly specific zhou et al . negative experiment where mismatches between a 4cl5grna designed based on the p. trichocarpa reference genome phytozome v3 and the corresponding sequence of p. tremula x alba 717 used for transformation abolished cleavage in all transgenic lines examined zhou et al . these results together with the highly heterologous nature of woody perennials suggest that off target cleavage of crispr cas9 is likely to be low in these species . the ability of crispr cas9 to discriminate single base differences makes it a powerful tool to investigate functional redundancy of highly homologous genes that are otherwise difficult to discern using gene silencing approaches . in the populus study that targeted pds 4 grnas were designed based on one gene model potri.014g148700 without considering the genome duplicate potri.002g235200 that shares a high degree 93 of coding sequence identity . as discussed above numerous studies have exploited sequence polymorphisms for developing gene or allele specific grnas to achieve precision editing by crispr cas9 . however few studies have addressed the added complexity of sequence polymorphisms on crispr cas9 genome editing probably because the common plant models such as arabidopsis rice soybean and tomato are selfing species with homozygous genomes . given the high levels of heterozygosity in tree species the need to consider sequence polymorphisms in genome editing experiments can not be over emphasized . to facilitate crispr cas9 genome editing in 717 we constructed a custom 717 genome by substituting 10 m sequence variants into the p. trichocarpa reference genome xue et al . together these data suggest that standard grna designs may suffer from a high probability of failure in crispr cas9 genome editing due to the frequent occurrence of snps indels in outcrossers . the modified variant sensitive pipeline for grna design called aspen crispr designer is also available at aspendb and can be applied to other species . thus for crispr cas9 applications that target promoter or other noncoding sequences e.g. the populus study extended the ever growing list of plant species successfully genome edited by crispr cas9 bortesi and fischer 2015 kumar and jain 2015 to woody perennials . the ability of crispr cas9 to generate null mutations in primary transformants and the promise of phenotypic consistency among independent biallelic mutants as demonstrated in the populus study make a compelling argument that it may soon become acceptable to characterize only a few transgenic lines with sequence verified mutations . even when only a few mutation events are obtained for difficult to transform species or from suboptimal transformation trials the ability to bypass rna level screening and to obtain stable mutations still confers advantages over the gene silencing approaches . crispr cas9 thus offers the enticing prospect of streamlined transgenic characterization and expedited large scale functional characterization . this process can be greatly simplified with crispr cas9 mutants as dna level analysis by amplicon sequencing can identify events with biallelic mutations for further analysis . c for species with a robust transformation system multiple biallelic crispr cas9 events can be used directly as biological replicates for in depth characterization . this process can be greatly simplified with crispr cas9 mutants as dna level analysis by amplicon sequencing can identify events with biallelic mutations for further analysis . c for species with a robust transformation system multiple biallelic crispr cas9 events can be used directly as biological replicates for in depth characterization . we note however that introgressing transgenic mutant events into elite genotypes is an established practice in crop and tree breeding programs and hence not unique to crispr cas9edited mutants .", " x ray intensities were obtained by fitting a model of the edx spectra to the experimental data using weighted least squares and atomic fractions were quantified from intensities using the cliff lorimer quantification . the edx elemental maps for cobalt iron and oxygen figure 1b d obtained by integration of the element s background subtracted k line x ray peak show that individual particles are comprised of a cobalt core surrounded by a shell composed of iron and oxygen as expected . these conventional edx element maps show the location of the various elements but the composition of the particle core for example can not be determined by elemental mapping due to the presence of the shell above and below the core in projection . elemental maps of b cobalt c iron and d oxygen display the location of the various elements with respect to the particle morphology scale bar 50 nm greyscale x ray counts . the edx spectrum image data of the cofe3o4 nanoparticle cluster shown in figure 1a was subsequently processed using bss methods in hyperspy . if we disregard the small copper peaks contained in all the independent components likely originating from the copper support mesh we see that ic0 contains cobalt x ray peaks ic1 iron and oxygen peaks and ic2 a carbon peak . result of bss by pca and ica of an edx si of a cofe3o4 core b corresponding independent component spectra contain the expected x ray lines for the elements present . from the selected element maps figure 4c e it is clear that with the exception of the two particles in the lower right hand corner the particles are comprised of a platinum rich core surrounded by an iron oxide shell . if we again disregard the spurious copper peak ic0 contains iron and platinum x ray peaks ic1 iron and oxygen peaks and ic2 a single carbon peak figure 4i . from this analysis it appears that the ica components represent the different phases present in the edx spectrum image ic0 ic1 and ic2 genuinely represent the bimetallic fept cores iron oxide shells and the carbon support respectively . a total of 12 edx sis were acquired in order to capture and analyze multiple fept bimetallic seed clusters . to accurately extract the intensity of the fe k and pt l peaks a model composed of one gaussian per x ray line and a background based on kramers and small expressions as developed elsewhere was used as shown in green in figure 5c . c fitting of the edx spectrum from a single seed circled in b to a model spectrum to determine the fe k and pt l peak intensities . a comparison of raw edx spectra extracted from fept bimetallic seed particles and from pure fe3o4 particles with ic0 and ic1 respectively is provided in figure 6 . comparison between raw edx spectra extracted from a fept bimetallic seed particle top and from an iron oxide particle bottom with ic0 and ic1 respectively . we have confirmed the accuracy of the analysis by comparing the calculated spectra from the platinum iron core and the iron oxide shell to those obtained from these structures in isolation and the excellent agreement suggests that bss therefore can be used to accurately analyze edx data .", " in the perfused rat pancreas the dynamics of camkii activation correlate with the amplitude of gsis and camkii activation is temporally associated with insulin secretion . in order to investigate metabolic memory of insulin producing cells we first had to develop a paradigm in which such memory was evident . as shown in figure 1b min6 cells exposed to the glucose pulse regimen showed higher insulin secretion both when exposed to low 2.8 mm or high 16.8 mm glucose than cells which had been cultured continuously at low glucose . this increase in insulin secretion was accompanied by a significant rise in the levels of phosphorylated camkii consistent with the notion that camkii might be a molecular mediator of this metabolic memory figure 1c and d . next we evaluated the kinetics of the cell response to acute glucose exposure and observed that the pulse group secreted more insulin at basal time zero and stimulatory concentrations of glucose 16.7 mm between 5 and 60 min following stimulation figure 1e . in parallel the phosphorylation of camkii was higher in the glucose pulse group at both glucose concentrations and remained elevated even after the glucose concentration was reduced to 2.8 mm figure 1f . thus min6 cells had acquired metabolic memory of prior exposure to glucose pulses which they retained through a 24h consolidation period . it was important to determine if metabolic memory is confined to min6 insulinoma cells or if it is also a property of primary human cells . as was the case in min6 cells the pulse group showed increased camkii phosphorylation at both basal and stimulatory glucose concentrations figure 2b . we also found using live cell calcium imaging of mouse islets that the increases in cytoplasmic calcium levels following acute glucose stimulation representing the penultimate step in insulin secretion are significantly higher in the pulse group compared with controls extended data figure 1c . to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which the glucose pulse paradigm induces memory in cells we evaluated the expression of essential mediators of the insulin secretory response . cerasi and colleagues had previously reported time dependent potentiation of insulin secretion in that exposure of rat islets to high glucose 27.7 mm up to 60 min prior to the test stimulation with glucose increased subsequent insulin secretion . given the pivotal role of altered insulin secretion in metabolic disorders future work will need to establish to what extent metabolic memory of pancreatic cells contributes to the pathophysiology of these diseases .", " increasingly we have come to understand that information about functional status is needed in order to appreciate the full picture regarding the health of an individual or a population . in most countries with a sophisticated health administrative data collection and utilization infrastructure a wide variety of information what is often missing is information that would link diagnosis and treatment with health outcomes that are fully meaningful to the patient s life namely information about the presence of decrements in capacity to carry out tasks and actions in areas of life as well as how these decrements play out in the person s actual real life environment deyo and patrick 1989 lubetkin et al . researchers in all areas of health and social policy at all levels need valid and reliable data about functional status in order to make informed decisions . fsi is a crucial element for the description of health states and quantification of overall health status in individuals that can be aggregated to a summary measure of population health . at the who the use of fsi is in this area in particular because this data collected by the world health survey now in the field in more than 70 countries feeds into ongoing endeavors to determine levels and distributions of health this survey would be inconceivable without information on health outcomes that describe health on multiple dimensions in terms of levels of functioning in a parsimonious set of domains . nonetheless before contemplating the systemwide changes required to collect fsi a classification that provides a common language and framework to describe the universe of functioning and disability is required . in order to complement the classification scheme a comprehensive coding system that creates consistent and comparable data across all settings of care and a method of routinely capturing and disseminating these data in a mode and manner consistent with social interests in preserving privacy linked to measurement tools for clinical and related encounters the foundation of a new structure for collecting fsi is therefore a standard classification and coding system that will make it feasible for fsi to be included in administrative data . in this article we want to briefly describe the extensive international developmental process that lead to the revision of the original international classification of impairments disabilities and handicaps icidh world health organization 1980 and produced the icf . a considerable academic literature built up around clinical and other uses of the icidh but much of this literature was critical of the underlying model of disability . over the next 10 years who s international collaborating centers and governmental and non governmental organizations including groups representing persons with disabilities engaged in the systematic revision of the icidh . from an exhaustive literature search of existing classifications and assessment tools the who revision team developed a 3000plus item pool of potential classification domain names for areas of human functioning at the body person and social levels . icf is the ruler with which we will take precise measurements of health and disability . undoubtedly the primary reason that icf can plausibly claim to be a universal tool for classifying states of functioning and disability is that the underlying model of the icf reflects our best understanding of the complex phenomena of functioning and disability in a manner that is to the greatest extent possible theory neutral and therefore compatible with whichever theoretical account of how disability arises at the individual and population levels that evidence may confirm . a paradigmatic shift in the thinking with regard to disability that is captured in the icf is the stress placed on health and levels of functioning . the icf on the other hand presents disability as a continuum relevant to the lives of all people to different degrees and at different times in their lives . by shifting the focus from cause to the full range of lived experiences it places all health conditions on an equal footing allowing them to be compared using a common metric the ruler of health and disability . from emphasizing people s disabilities and labeling people as disabled we now focus on the level of health and functional capacity of all people . moreover icf is grounded in the principle of universality namely that functioning and disability are applicable to all people irrespective of health condition and in particular that disability or decrement in functioning at one or more levels is not the mark of a specific minority class of people but is a feature of the human condition which is epidemiologically speaking over the lifespan a universal phenomena . it is no longer plausible to insist that the icf is a medical classification of people with disability that it reduces all issues of functional status to underlying medical conditions that it ignores the often salient role of the physical and social environment in the creation of restrictions of participation experienced by persons with functional problems . the model that informs icf portrays functioning and decrements in functioning or disability as a dynamic interaction between health conditions diseases disorders and injuries and contextual factors . the terms functioning and disability in the icf are the general or umbrella terms for respectively the positive and negatives aspects of the interaction between an individual with a health condition and that individual s contextual factors environmental and personal factors . this structure makes it possible for icf to be used as a classification tool for systematically describing situations of human functioning and problems with functioning . this complex information is organized by icf by means of a hierarchical coding system thereby creating a common international language for functioning and disability . icf organizes information by means of several classifications distributed into two parts 1 a component of functioning and disability that includes the component of the body with the body function and body structure classifications and the component of activities and participation that includes all domains denoting aspects of functioning from an individual and social perspective organized into a single classification and 2 a component of contextual factors that has a list of environmental factors organized from the individual s most immediate to the wider environment . in order for these domains to capture descriptive information about functioning and disability in particular cases they must be used in conjunction with qualifiers that record the presence and severity of a problem or decrement in functioning at the body person and social levels . as a general matter of describing functioning and disability phenomena fully and accurately the performance capacity having access to both performance and capacity data enables icf users to determine the gap between capacity and performance . icf thus makes it possible to measure the effect of a person s environment on their decrement in functioning given their health condition . for its use as a classification of functional status relevant for health administrative records icf provides a complete classification of both body and person level domains of functioning . the challenge for incorporating the icf into clinical and administrative records beyond a lexicon and framework lies in identifying this parsimonious set of domains or items that captures decrements in functioning across different health conditions and a smaller subset of domains or items that uniquely describe the decrements of functioning that typify a given health condition . in addition the mapping of instruments that measure functioning and disability that are already in use onto icf categories will allow a ready crosswalk between measurements already being made at points of encounter to a common framework cieza et al . the use of the icf in larger population based surveys will also provide data on norms and distributions of health functioning and disability that will enable the setting of appropriate thresholds for a multitude of purposes . table 4 maps the domains of the icf that have been included in different waves of the world health survey that ought to be included as a minimum or ideal set for information systems . the recognition that a description of health and health related outcomes must go beyond a narrow view of health restricted to the absence of disease as well as that the definition of disability must move beyond the narrow impairment based view that has been traditionally adopted to define a minority population will go a long way in bridging the gap between health and disability data . its usefulness in describing functional health status information will be one of the measures of its success .", " conversely a recent large retrospective study found that the false positive hiv eia rate was lower in pregnant women compared to nonpregnant individuals 0.14 versus 0.21 . our objective was to determine if any maternal characteristics correlated with false positive hiv eia testing at delivery . compared to hiv negative patients false positive patients were more likely to be nulliparous 43 versus 31 p 0.001 and younger mean age 23.9 5.7 versus 26.2 5.9 p 0.001 . hiv positive patients were significantly older than false positive patients 27.4 versus 23.9 p 0.001 and hiv negative patients 27.4 versus 26.2 p 0.012 . of the 47794 women 47391 99 were hiv negative 145 0.3 had a false positive test 172 0.4 were true positives and 86 0.2 tested equivocal or were missing hiv results . the specificity of the hiv eia test was 99.7 with a positive predictive value of 54.3 . we found that younger and nulliparous women were more likely to have false positive testing using the hiv eia . this information could be useful for counseling women who test positive for hiv at delivery and emphasizes the limitations of eia testing if used as a rapid test to determine the need for intrapartum and neonatal antiretroviral prophylaxis . the false positive rates of currently available rapid hiv tests have been reported to be much lower than has been found with eia testing in this study . evaluated the hiv false positive rate in over 900 pregnant women most of whom were hispanic using both the eia and a rapid point of care poct test oraquick . the results of our study may aid in counseling women if they test preliminarily positive for hiv using the eia while awaiting confirmatory testing results . further studies are needed to confirm our findings elucidate the biological mechanisms for increased hiv eia false positivity in young nulliparous women and compare this conventional testing method with contemporary rapid screening assays including poct .", " although gas6 gene polymorphisms are reported to be associated with stroke acute coronary syndrome and type 2 diabetes 2224 to our knowledge both gas6 and axl gene polymorphisms associated with childhood obesity have not yet been identified . in order to address this issue we conducted a community based study to determine whether common variations in the gas6 and axl genes correlate with adiposity systemic inflammation insulin resistance among adolescents . to determine whether the gas6 and axl snps are predictors of obesity and obesity associated complications logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the odds ratio or and 95 confidence interval ci for each genotype and combined genotypes . moreover boys with the gg genotype of gas6 rs8191974 had significantly higher bmi wc and hscrp levels than those carrying the a allele . in addition the association between circulating gas6 protein levels and gas6 polymorphisms was investigated . we found that the gas6 rs8191973 or rs8191974 genotypes were not significantly associated with circulating gas6 protein levels in both the sexes . moreover boys with the gg genotype of gas6 rs8191974 exhibited a 1.40fold greater risk for developing high bmi a 1.58fold greater risk for developing high wc and a 2.68fold greater risk to have higher il6 levels than the a allele carriers . even after adjusting for all possible confounding factors including age tanner stage smoking drinking status and physical activity the relationship between the gg genotype of gas6 rs8191974 higher bmi wc and higher il6 levels still remained significant in boys . logistic regression analyses were applied to evaluate whether the combination of the gas6 rs8191974 and rs8191973 polymorphisms is a stronger risk factor for high adiposity inflammatory markers levels and homa ir than when alone . the combined effects of the 2 gas6 gene polymorphisms in the risk of high bmi wc il6 and hscrp levels are shown in figure 1 . after adjusting for the relevant confounding factors we still observed that boys with the gg genotype of gas6 rs8191973 and the gg genotype of gas6 rs8191974 exhibited a 47fold higher risk of high bmi wc il6 and hscrp levels than the individuals with both the c allele of the gas6 rs8191973 and the a allele of the gas6 rs8191974 did or 4.92 95 ci 1.0823.6 p 0.018 or 4.18 95 ci 1.0522.5 p 0.016 or 4.08 95 ci 1.0628.56 p 0.015 or 7.22 95 ci 1.4635.72 p 0.010 resp . in addition we evaluated the combined effect of the gas6 rs8191973 or rs8191974 marker with axl gene polymorphisms and its association with risk of high adiposity inflammatory marker and homa ir . in this study a strong association between gas6 and axl polymorphisms with body adiposity systemic inflammation and insulin resistance was identified among boys . the risk of possessing high adiposity and inflammatory markers levels was higher in boys carrying the gg genotype with gas6 rs8191973 or rs8191974 than the noncarriers . moreover the combination of both gas6 polymorphisms had an additive effect on the development of obesity and obesity associated inflammation in boys . these data strongly suggest that gas6 and axl genes play a role in the pathogenesis of childhood obesity and its associated complications . in this study gas6 is further implicated as a candidate susceptibility gene for obesity and systemic inflammation . we hypothesize that gas6 polymorphisms could affect the biology of the gas6 protein itself rather than its transcription or process rate thus influencing adiposity regulation and systemic inflammation . together these findings suggest that the gas6 rs8191974 polymorphisms play an important role in the development of obesity and obesity associated complications e.g. the protective role of the aa genotype of gas6 rs8191974 against the developing childhood obesity and obesity associated complications requires further study . moreover the combination of gas6 and axl gene polymorphisms is not significantly associated with any variables in adiposity among adolescents . in addition our present study also indicates that gender disparity exists regarding the effects of the gas6 polymorphisms on anthropometric characteristics and inflammatory markers . therefore we hypothesized that the gender specific effect of the gas6 polymorphisms on childhood obesity might be due to a disparity in sex hormone distributions . first this was a cross sectional study as such we might not be able to assess gas6 polymorphisms on weight dynamics and the development of obesity associated complications throughout life . in conclusion we indicate an association between the gas6 and axl polymorphisms with adiposity circulating inflammatory markers and insulin resistance of adolescents especially in boys . moreover the gg genotype of gas6 rs8191973 or rs8191974 strongly correlates with susceptibility to develop obesity and systemic inflammation in boys .", " although the advances in assisted reproductive techniques have opened new doors for infertile couples but studies have shown that these treatments are accompanied with stress anxiety and depression . evaluating the related factors of depression and anxiety among iranian infertile couples showed that women who were infertile themselves showed higher levels of anxiety and depression than women with male factor infertility . however in societies that define women as the main source of fertility starting assisted reproductive treatments with limited successful outcomes could be harmful to these women s mental health . these conditions could affect the vulnerability of fertile women during assisted reproductive treatment therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of assisted reproductive treatments on fertile women s mental health . demographic and clinical data results showed no significant difference in the mean score of different dimension of mental health before ovulation induction and after oocyte harvesting table 2 . the present study aimed to assess the level of mental health in fertile women undergoing assisted reproductive treatments as a result of male factor infertility at the beginning of ovulation stimulation process and the effect of this process on their mental health . but the level of depression and anxiety disorders at the beginning of ovulation stimulation was higher in the present research than other reports . with regards to the negative impact of anxiety and depression during the treatment on the result of assisted reproduction treatment it is necessary that this group of women would be examined before the treatment process since they are exposed to risks of mental health disorders and be treated in case of high levels of depression and anxiety . following the assessment of the main hypothesis of the research that is the effect of ovulation stimulation on women s mental health study results showed that ovulation stimulation does not affect mental health the level of depression and anxiety and the measure of psychological disorders in these two dimensions did not show a significant difference before the ovulation and after the harvesting process . the negative impact of distress of infertility treatment on the level of depression has already been reported . the cessation of treatment distress with the conclusion of ovulation stimulation and harvesting processes might be a reason for the decrease of depression level in subjects under study . furthermore results showed that fertile women s level of depression and anxiety does not depend on the reaction of the ovary to the ovulation stimulation and as these women have no problem in ovarian response to ovulation stimulation their mental health depends more on other factors . this study showed that fertile women who undergo assisted reproduction treatments do not start the treatment process in an appropriate mental health condition and this condition would continue during the whole process until egg harvesting .", " balance impairment is an important fall risk factor and increases in range of postural sway in the mediolateral direction in older adults are associated with increased fall risk and rates . overall vitamin d supplementation did not reduce rate of falls rar 1.00 95 ci 0.90 to 1.11 seven trials 9324 participants or risk of falling rr 0.96 95 ci 0.89 to 1.03 13 trials 26 747 participants but may do so in people with lower vitamin d levels before treatment . fracture rates from falls in older adults also increase at the end of the winter season following two to eight weeks after the nadir in serum vitamin d levels . some studies report an increased rate of falls for both inside and outside falls 13 14 however significant seasonal variation in fall rates was not found in a three year study while in a second study seasonal variation in fall rates was reported in women but not in men . the aim of this study was to determine differences in static balance postural sway vitamin d incidence of falls and type of fall serially at the end of each season over a 12month period in older community living adults . we hypothesised that postural sway falls and vitamin d would show a seasonal variation and that there would be an inverse relationship between vitamin d and the other variables . at the end of consecutive seasons static balance vitamin d status and fall rate were measured within a longitudinal study design . this repeated measures cohort study was designed to be able to detect differences in postural sway . mixed methods poisson regression was used to determine associations between falls fall injuries and postural balance and vitamin d. the association between postural balance and vitamin d and season was estimated using mixed methods linear regression adjusted for age gender and strength . increased postural sway was associated with fall injuries irr 1.59 ci 1.14 to 2.24 p 0.007 but not fall rates irr 1.36 ci 0.95 to 1.97 p 0.09 . less injuries from falls were recorded in spring than any other season p 0.02 with no other seasonal differences recorded . there was a significant relationship between postural sway and the number of injurious falls observed with lower values for sway range i.e. mediolateral sway range has been shown to be an independent fall risk factor for indoor falls . in our study a lower proportion of falls occurred indoors 29 compared to outdoors 71 and although this is similar to other studies where more healthy samples have been reported as having a greater proportion of falls being outdoor falls 74 it may be a reason why no association between sway range and fall incidence was seen . a trend for this association was evident and a larger sample size may have found a significant relationship between these two variables as this study was powered to determine mediolateral sway changes not fall rates . an association between increased sway range and rate of injurious falls was recorded in our study reinforcing the importance of this measure for those most at risk of injury . if this threshold situation is true it may be that seasonal variation in postural sway may be present in a population with much lower levels of vitamin d but this is outside the scope of the current study . fall rates in older old adults over 75 years have been shown to vary seasonally but consistent data for the general population of healthy older community dwelling adults has not been previously reported . for our generally healthy study population it is likely that our participants were engaged in outdoor activities with higher associated risk of falls during the warmer weather for example several summer falls occurred while bushwalking . studies in the area of seasonal variation in fracture rates provide good evidence for increased fracture rates from falls in winter but these appear in populations with older participants than ours mean age over 75 years 8 13 .", " therefore the present study aimed to validate the speculation that the alkaloids in aqueous extract of s. alata leaves are responsible for its abortifacient activity . the focus on alkaloid was a follow up from our previous study that speculated on alkaloids to be responsible for the abortifacient activity of the crude extract of s. alata leaves and from several studies that implicated the phytochemical property of colchicine quinazoline alkaloids e.g. by the 19th day 24 hr after their last dose the following parameters were recorded computed number of live fetuses number of dead fetuses average weight of live foetuses survival ratio number of live fetuses number of live dead fetuses 100 number of rats that aborted percentage of rats that aborted number of rats that aborted number of rats assessed 100 number of rats with vaginal bleeding number of implantation sites number of corpora lutea implantation indextotal number of implantation sites number of corpora lutea 100 pre implantation lossnumber of corpora lutea number of implantation sites number of corpora lutea 100 post implantation loss number of implantation sites number of live fetuses number of implantation sites 100 number of resorption sites number of implantation sites in the control animals number of implantations in the test animals resorption indextotal number of resorption sites total number of implantation sites 100 . by the 19th day 24 hr after their last dose the following parameters were recorded computed number of live fetuses number of dead fetuses average weight of live foetuses survival ratio number of live fetuses number of live dead fetuses 100 number of rats that aborted percentage of rats that aborted number of rats that aborted number of rats assessed 100 number of rats with vaginal bleeding number of implantation sites number of corpora lutea implantation indextotal number of implantation sites number of corpora lutea 100 pre implantation lossnumber of corpora lutea number of implantation sites number of corpora lutea 100 post implantation loss number of implantation sites number of live fetuses number of implantation sites 100 number of resorption sites number of implantation sites in the control animals number of implantations in the test animals resorption indextotal number of resorption sites total number of implantation sites 100 . the alkaloid truncated the development of the fetuses as none of them survived in the experiment groups as against the average number of live fetuses of 10.26 in the distilled water treated control animals table 1 . the percentage of fetal death in the 250 500 and 1000 mg kg body weight of the alkaloid treated animals was 6.03 6.00 and 6.50 respectively . while the implantation index was similarly high in all the alkaloid treated animals the resorption index as well as pre and post implantation losses were many fold higher than the controls table 1 . although all the pregnant rats gained weight at the end of the experimental period final maternal weight compared with their weight prior to pairing with the males initial maternal weight table 1 the weight gained by the alkaloid treated animals was about 50 less than the control animals . effect of the alkaloids from senna alata leaves on some abortifacient parameters of pregnant rats values are expressed as meansd of six independent determinations test values carrying superscripts different from the control for each parameter in the same row are significantly different p 0.05 . maternal weights of the animals before pregnancy were compared with their corresponding weights after pregnancy for each treatment group p 0.05 all different doses of the alkaloids significantly p 0.05 decreased the serum concentrations of the follicle stimulating hormone luteinizing hormone and progesterone in the pregnant animals table 2 . effect of alkaloids from senna alata leaves on some female reproductive hormones of pregnant wistar rats values are expressed as meansd of six independent determinations test values carrying superscripts different from the control for each parameter in the same row are significantly different p 0.05 the alkaloids also decreased p 0.05 the absolute weight of the uterus computed uterine to body weight ratio and concentrations of uterine glucose and cholesterol table 3 . furthermore the alkaloids did not provoke vaginal opening or cornification in any of the animals table 3 . effect of alkaloids from senna alata leaves on some indices of oestrogenicity in pregnant rats values are expressed as meansd of six independent determinations test values carrying superscripts different from the control for each parameter in the same row are significantly different p 0.05 analysis of the tl chromatogram indicated that the mixture consisted of five alkaloids as evidenced by the creamy precipitates and reddish brown spots produced with meyer s and wagner s reagents respectively . in the present study alkaloids from s. alata leaves significantly affected the fetal and maternal parameters of the animals . for instance the death of the fetuses in the alkaloid treated pregnant rats may not only suggest inhibition of mitotic division of the fetuses 25 since the animals were exposed during the period of organogenesis but may also show its relevance to the reduction in the concentrations of gonadotropins and progesterone in the present study . 2 on the aqueous leaf extract of the plant where only the 500 and 1000 mg kg body weight of the extract produced fetal death . furthermore the absence of abortion and vaginal bleeding in the alkaloid treated animals which were hitherto observed with the crude extract in our previous study suggest zero abortifacient activity for the alkaloid . it is interesting to note that both the number of implantation sites and corpora lutea decreased in the alkaloid treated animals when the process of implantation ought to have been completed implantation takes place normally within 5 6 days post coitus in rats before the exposure of the animals to the alkaloid mixture treatment commenced from day 10 of pregnancy . therefore the high implantation index and pre and post implantation losses suggest that pregnancy was interrupted by the alkaloid probably creating an environment that was not conducive for the fertilized eggs . therefore the increase in the resorption index in the alkaloid treated animals confers antifertility effects such as anti implantation anti blastocystic and antizygotic of the alkaloid . the alkaloid did not exhibit complete abortifacient effect since the pregnant animals exposed to the alkaloid presented with closed vagina just like the controls . thus it is possible that the alkaloids posses anti gonadotropic and anti progestogenic activities which are inimical to the continued development of the fetuses . many plant extracts with anti fertility properties are known to exhibit estrogenic activity by increasing protein synthesis uterine weight water uptake and retention of fluid leading to ballooning of the uterus uterine content of glucose cholesterol glycogen and alkaline phosphatase activity thereby changing the uterine milieu and creating non receptive conditions in the uterus 32 . overall the alkaloid from s. alata leaves at the oral doses of 250 500 and 1000 mg kg body weight on daily basis from days 10 until day 18 post coitum exhibited several potential effects on the maternal and fetal outcomes of pregnant rats anti implantation anti gonadotropic anti progesteronic selective estrogenic embryonic resorption and fetotoxic activities but it could not induce abortion in the animals . therefore the alkaloids may not alone be responsible for the abortifacient effects of the crude extract of s. alata which had been reported earlier .", " erg protein expression has been recently suggested to be reflective of erg gene rearrangements in prostate cancer pca documenting remarkable concordance between the two 16 . previous studies investigating the prognostic significance of erg gene rearrangements have revealed mixed results 1922 . some studies investigating the significance of erg protein expression in localized pca failed to show association with adverse clinical outcome 23 24 . in the current study we investigated the association of erg protein expression to clinical pathological parameters in a cohort of men with localized prostate cancer . figure 2 demonstrates examples of erg expression in tissue samples and the distribution of erg in relation to gleason score . when investigating relations between erg expression and pathological parameters there was significant association between erg expression and higher disease stage . although not informative due to limited patients numbers the association between erg expression and higher stage disease was more pronounced in patients with higher gs . published reports on the significance of erg expression to patients outcome are conflicting with some showing association with adverse outcome while others document no association . however it is proposed that erg signifies a molecular class of prostate cancer and may play a role in disease progression within those tumors . these observations suggest that the method utilized in determining erg status the inclusion or exclusion of other genomic aberration and the cohort chosen may be the reason for the different results obtained in various studies investigating the role of erg in prostate cancer . however in contrast to earlier studies we document significant association between erg expression and some pathological parameters . more importantly in addition to not documenting any clinical prognostic significance for erg expression we did not observe any association between erg expression and other pathological parameters such as gleason score or surgical margins which further diminishes any potential prognostic significance for erg expression at least in localized pca . another issue worth mentioning regarding erg is that erg gene rearrangements have been previously associated with specific histopathological features and detected more frequently in some morphologic variants of prostate cancer than others . moreover the lack of association with any other pathological parameters also significantly diminishes any potential clinical application of erg expression at least in men with localized prostate cancer .", " however literature regarding perforator flaps of ata or anterior supramalleolar artery asma one of the major branches of distal ata are scant . these papers either mention the existence of the perforators from ata or asma or describe their communication with the medial and lateral supramalleolar arteries . the objective of this study was to identify the anatomic parameters of the asma and its perforators that would enable microsurgeons to harvest potentially multi paddle flaps or composite flaps from the foot and ankle region . the collaterals between asma and the medial and lateral supramalleolar arteries and the number of perforators were observed . the medial branch gives off ascendant perforators and descendent perforators a type b the anterior supramalleolar artery originates as lateral and medial artery branches at the same point . 3 descendent perforators 4 lateral branches 5 proximal end of anterior tibial artery ata 6 distal end of ata 7 extensor retinaculum 8 blood supply to tibia b the anterior supramalleolar artery orients as lateral

artery huber dissected 200 feet and was the first to describe the asma as a vessel arising about 5 cm above the ankle joint . in 2003 koshima dissected 4 ankles and described that the asma has 1 2 perforators just above the extensor retinaculum and gives off the anterolateral and anteromedial branches . in addition due to its collateral connection with the posterior tibial artery and peroneal artery a reverse flow anterolateral or anteromedial flap can also be designed as described in literature .", " thus gastrocnemius stretching and talocrural joint mobilization have been performed as intervention strategies to increase ankle df prom3 8 9 . therefore the aim of the present study was to examine the influence of gastrocnemius stretching combined with joint mobilization on wb ankle df prom . wb ankle df prom with knee extended was measured following the procedures suggested by munteanu et al10 . the difference in wb ankle df prom with knee extended between pre and post intervention conditions was analyzed using a paired t test . wb ankle df prom with knee extended was significantly increased in post intervention compared with pre intervention conditions 42.60 5.49 versus 38.24 4.69 p 0.001 . our findings demonstrate that gastrocnemius stretching combined with joint mobilization significantly increases wb ankle df prom with knee extended . although gastrocnemius stretching combined with joint mobilization was applied for 5 min in the present study the amount of increase in wb ankle df prom after intervention i.e.", " renal dox induced toxicity may be part of a multiorgan damage mediated mainly through free radical formation eventually leading to membrane lipid peroxidation . in addition dox has a direct renal damaging effect as it accumulates preferentially in the kidney . dox has toxic effects on other organs such as heart and liver which may lead to modulation of blood supply to the kidney and alter xenobiotic detoxification processes respectively thus indirectly contributing to dox induced nephropathy . a major cause of dox induced nephrotoxicity is the production of reactive oxygen species which induce cytokines including interleukin 1 6 9 10 . the doses of dox and dia were based on the previous studies 4 11 . the doses of dox and dia were based on the previous studies 4 11 . rats receiving a single dose of dox 15 mg kg ip showed a significant increase in serum creatinine and urea levels compared to control group . both doses of dia resulted in significant decrease in serum creatinine compared to dox treated rats . dia 50 mg kg day but not 25 mg kg day resulted in significant decrease in serum urea compared to dox treated rats . dox 15 mg kg significantly increased renal mda and nox levels compared to control group . administrating both doses of dia to dox treated rats significantly decreased mda and nox compared to dox treated group . treatment with dox 15 mg kg caused significant decrease in renal gsh sod and catalase levels compared with untreated control group table 2 . concomitant treatment of dox with dia significantly increased the levels of renal gsh sod and catalase compared to dox treated group . administration of dox caused significant increase in the immunoreactivity of caspase3 nfb and tnf figures 2 3 and 4 and table 4 respectively which were highly expressed in both renal glomeruli and tubules cytoplasmically and in some nuclei . administration of both doses of dia concomitantly with dox decreased the expression of them compared to dox group . nephrotoxic action of dox is also considered to be via drug induced free radical generation . this directed our attention to investigate the role of dia which is interleukin 1 receptor antagonist as a possible nephroprotective agent against dox induced renal damage . induction of dox nephrotoxicity was detected in our study by significant elevation of serum urea and creatinine levels which were confirmed by toxic histopathological changes compared to control group . the nephrotoxic effect of dox is characterized by decreasing glomerular filtration rate leading to a rise in serum urea and creatinine . improvement of dox induced nephrotoxicity was previously tried by compounds that partially succeeded in preserving normal renal function and structure probably through their antioxidant and anti inflammatory effects as caffeic acid phenethyl ester zingiber officinale roscoe and solanum torvum so that we investigated the role of another antioxidant and anti inflammatory drug as dia on dox induced nephrotoxicity . dia could significantly decrease serum urea and creatinine compared to dox treated group . that is due to the anti inflammatory and antioxidant effects of dia which suppress dox mediated oxidative stress inflammation and tissue damage . our histopathological changes showed that dox treated group presented with marked damage of renal tubules . in our study the activities of sod and catalase significantly decreased in dox treated rats in kidney as compared to control rats . that was detected in our study which showed significant increase of mda level in dox treated group compared to control group . the current findings showed that dox administration significantly increased renal level of nox compared to control group and that is in agreement with other studies 26 37 . in conclusion dia protected against dox induced nephrotoxicity in rats most probably due to its antioxidant and anti inflammatory activities .", " among korean adolescents engaging in wcb 13.4 of boys and 18.8 of girls took inappropriate methods to control their weight 16 . inappropriate wcb are a harmful influence on adolescents physical and psychological development 12 . in the present study we investigate not only the association between inappropriate wcb and suicide ideation and attempt but also the difference in this association with body mass index body weight perception and body shape misperception . moreover we investigate the top five wcb combinations used by korean adolescents and examine the association between these five wcb combinations and suicide ideation and attempt . additionally we performed a set of subgroup analyses using bwp bmi and bsm to determine whether body related variables led to differences in the association between wcb and suicide ideation and attempt . additionally we performed a set of subgroup analyses using bwp bmi and bsm to determine whether body related variables led to differences in the association between wcb and suicide ideation and attempt . boys who had engaged in inappropriate wcb were more likely to report suicide ideation than those not engaging in wcb group or 1.57 p 0.001 . girls engaging in inappropriate wcb also had a high suicide ideation rate or 1.32 p 0.001 . boys engaging in inappropriate wcb were also more likely to attempt suicide than those not engaging in wcb or 2.49 p 0.001 . girls engaging in appropriate wcb or 1.21 p 0.02 or inappropriate wcb or 1.92 p 0.001 were more likely to attempt suicide than girls not engaging in wcb at all and the association was stronger among the latter comparison group . the association between suicidal behavior and wcb stratified by bmi bwp and bsm is shown in table 3 . boys with an underweight bmi and that engaged in inappropriate wcb experienced the highest rate of suicide ideation or 2.22 p 0.05 compared to other bmi groups . girls with an underweight bmi and that engaged in inappropriate wcb were 4.53 times more likely to attempt suicide than girls who did not engage in wcb . girls who perceived their weight as normal and engaged in inappropriate wcb were more likely to experience suicide ideation or 1.50 p 0.001 and attempt or 2.31 p 0.001 than girls who did not engage in wcb . considering bsm boys who distorted their body shape and who engaged in inappropriate wcb were more likely to experience suicide ideation underestimate or 1.44 p 0.01 overestimate or 1.91 p 0.01 and attempt underestimate or 1.96 p 0.01 overestimate or 2.94 p 0.01 than boys who do not engaged in wcb . girls who underestimated or overestimated their body shape and engaged in inappropriate wcb showed significant association with suicide attempt underestimate or 1.89 p 0.001 overestimate or 1.73 p 0.001 compared to girls who do not engaged in wcb . in the present study we investigated association between inappropriate wcb and suicide ideation and attempt by korean adolescent by using nationally represented data . inappropriate wcb was significantly associated with suicidal behaviors in both boys and girls and with a higher rate in boys . therefore one possible interpretation of this finding is that wcb represent a risk factor for suicide ideation and attempt by causing depression or eating disorders both of which have serious consequences on adolescents mental health . in the context of bmi underweight boys engaged in inappropriate wcb experienced the highest rate of suicide ideation and attempt than other bmi groups and underweight girls were considerably more likely to attempt suicide . additionally suicidal behavior was also associated with boys and girls of a normal weight engaged in inappropriate wcb . this suggests that adolescents who do not need to control their weight but engage in unnecessary wcb nonetheless are at higher risk for experienced adverse consequences 12 . eventually the effect of inappropriate wcb aggravates adverse effects from a distorted body image and it seems that this psychological burden causes adolescents to think about or attempt suicide . we also extracted the five most common combinations of weight control methods used by korean adolescents and investigated the association between these wcb and suicidal behaviors . the most common wcb engaged in by girls was regular exercise and eating less and it also did not show any significant association with suicidal behaviors . interestingly both boys and girls engaging in regular exercise fasting and eating less were more likely to experience suicidal behaviors compared to those who did not conduct any wcb . considering that the high incidence of suicide and the severe negative impact of adolescents inappropriate wcb on their health our findings represent an important motivation for health policy makers to identify solutions for controlling adolescents suicide problem . additionally as shown here wcb can be associated with health compromising behaviors including suicide ideation and attempt .", " by changing residue 66 andor the amino acid residues around the chromophore n1c1c2c3 and c1c2c3c4 dihedral angles of the gfp chromophore . the fluorescent emission of the chromophore within gfp occurs with high efficiency quantum yield fl 0.8 and a respectable fluorescence lifetime 3 ns.19 when the protein is denatured the fluorescence yield decreases by at least 3 orders of magnitude.20 model compounds of the chromophore do not fluoresce in solution quantum yield fl 10 unless the rotation of the arylalkene bond is restrained.21 fluorescence can however be obtained by lowering the temperature to 77 k this freezes the solution . it has been proposed that in the absence of the protein matrix which surrounds the chromophore and prevents twisting this process can lead to fluorescence quenching internal crossing32 see figure 3 . b in the ground state s0 the residues surrounding the gfp chromophore exert a twisting force on the chromophore . upon excitation the conjugation across the ethylenic bridge of the chromophore is reduced and it will twist however the protein matrix prevents the chromophore from reaching the perpendicularly twisted conformation and fluorescence quenching internal crossing is prevented . in pyp the asymmetric proteinchromophore interaction probably serves as the initial accelerant for the light induced photocycle50 which ultimately leads to a cistrans isomerization.51 the chromophore in wild type gfp is planar due its extended system see figure 1 however the energy barrier to deformation is low and the protein matrix in wild type gfp exerts some strain away from planarity . when the chromophore is computationally permitted to freely rotate it will adopt a conformation that complements the protein matrix . recently we have used computational methods to show that wild type gfp is not an anomaly and that all gfp and gfp like proteins in the protein databank have a protein matrix that is not complementary with a planar chromophore.54 in most cases the freely rotating chromophore undergoes rotations of at least 20. in some cases these rotations are accompanied by an equal but opposite rotation of the dihedral angle a negatively correlated ht . they found the energy minimum conformation of a freely rotating chromophore in the protein matrix of the gfp mutant or gfp like protein examined however they did not provide any information about the range of low energy conformations available to a freely rotating chromophore . to get this information we ran molecular dynamics simulations of some of the interesting gfp mutants in the protein databank.56 by running molecular dynamics simulations with freely rotating and dihedrals we have been able to determine the range of conformations available to chromophores with complete rotational freedom . molecular mechanics and dynamics calculations have been used to examine the steric environment of the chromophore in gfp in its ground state . therefore in an attempt to supplement the quantum calculations we have examined the conformational space available to the chromophore within gfp using a freely rotating chromophore that is an approximation based on qm calculations of the conformational space available to the chromophore in its excited state . as shown in figure 2 gfp adopts two states the neutral state a of the chromophore with the phenolic oxygen protonated and the anionic species b the change from forms a to i is solely a protonation change while the change from i to b is a conformational change with most changes occurring at thr203.67 in order to see whether the gfp chromophore has different dihedral freedom in forms a b and i we conducted molecular dynamical simulations with a freely rotating chromophore as described in the . it has been suggested that this is due to the fact that his66 bfp chromophore forms fewer hydrogen bonds with the surrounding protein than tyr66 gfp chromophore does and that the smaller imadazole ring his66 in bfp may have more conformational freedom than the larger phenol tyr66 which leads to more intersystem crossing.27 in a very elegant series of experiments boxer et al . these steps are probably linked with dissociation of the hydrogen bond between the chromophore and his148 or an intervening water molecule and to the barrier for chromophore twisting in the excited state respectively.70 in order to establish the consequences of the y66h mutation on the flexibility of the chromophore molecular dynamics simulations of the ph 8.5 bfp crystal structure pdb code 2emd with neutral imidazole rings for his66 and his148 with a freely rotating chromophore were run . the smaller imadazole ring of the bfp chromophore results in more dihedral freedom for the chromophore in bfp than phenol in gfp however there seems to be no large difference in the number and stability of hydrogen bonds formed by the chromophore in the two fps . figure 6 and table 1 show that the conformational space available to the chromophore in bfp is larger than that in a5 and that the bfp conformations tend to be further from planarity i.e. 73 the resultant mutant yfp is red shifted by 16 nm relative to gfp s65 t and does indeed have a stacking interaction between the chromophore and tyr203.74 on the basis of the crystal structure of yfp remington et al . proposed that the red shift was due to the additional polarizability of the stacked tyr203 the hydrogen bond pattern around the chromophore or an out of plane distortion of the chromophore in analogy with out of plane distortions in porphyrin systems.74 comparison with the t203v mutant revealed that the t203y substitution leads to a significant i form population and only about 10 nm of the shift can be ascribed to the interaction.75 a new varient of yfp venus with improved brightness and maturation properties as well as a reduced environmental sensitivity was developed and crystallized.58 since some researchers have argued that the presence of tyr203 leads to a decrease in chromophore flexibility van der waals volume for tyr 141 vs 93 for thr and others argue that this is not necessarily so32 we have examined the conformational space available to a freely rotating chromophore in yfp pdb code 1myw with the phenol of tyr66 in both the protonated and unprotonated forms . both table 1 and figure 8 show that the chromophore in the phenolic form in gfp and yfp has differing rotational freedom . in yfp the chromophore has approximately 1.2 times more dihedral freedom than in gfp and although the dihedrals undergo negatively correlated hula twisting in both proteins in yfp the average conformation sampled is further from planarity than that found in gfp i.e. some have suggested that the crystal structures of strongly fluorescent gfp and gfp like proteins have their chromophores in a cis configuration while those of the nonfluorescent proteins are in a trans configuration .", " this is advantageous for three reasons each needle pass can be examined to determine tumor cell adequacy there is an opportunity to engage the clinical care provider in a conversation regarding the preliminary diagnosis and relevant molecular diagnostic tests and the cytopathology team member can help ensure that the specimen is processed in a manner that optimizes judicious triage for ancillary tests including molecular studies . fnas can be performed without rose and in this setting the contents of the fna needles are typically expelled and rinsed in a cell preservative solution for use in liquid based cytology lbc preparations . alternatively the needle contents can be distributed over multiple smears allowing for flexibility in the utilization of direct smears for cytomorphologic evaluation and ancillary studies fig . based on the findings in the diff quik stained smears the determination can be made to perform additional needle passes to obtain more tumor cells for diagnosis andor anticipated ancillary studies while the patient is still accessible . this overall approach is flexible forgiving and engages the cytopathology team in maximizing the chance of success in obtaining adequate cellular material for diagnosis and ancillary studies . this approach can help minimize the chances of encountering the scenario in which diagnostic cellular material is present on only one smear microdissection of the cells for molecular studies can result in sacrificing this only diagnostic slide in this context which can have medico legal consequences . this is analogous to a ffpe block of small biopsy tissue which can be sectioned for evaluation via the hematoxylin and eosin stain and ancillary tests such as immunocytochemistry or molecular diagnostic assays . recently given the shortcomings of cell blocks there has been an increasing appreciation of alternative cytopreparatory platforms for molecular testing such as direct smears and lbc samples . in the subsequent sections below the utilization of these cytopreparatory platforms will be discussed in the context of the clinically relevant mutations and translocations analyzed during molecular diagnostic testing of nsclcs . nonetheless this test requires a relatively higher enrichment of tumor cell dna content in the sample . this can be problematic in both small biopsy and cytology specimens especially cell blocks in which the tumor cell population can be diluted by background benign cellular elements such as inflammatory cells bronchial epithelial cells andor stromal mesenchymal cells . therefore often times there is more reliance on tumor cell enrichment by either macrodissection or microdissection to obtain a reliable result . as mentioned previously ffpe cell blocks represent the traditional cytopreparatory platform on which ancillary molecular diagnostic tests are performed . nonetheless in light of the inherent disadvantages of cell blocks mentioned previously investigation into other cytopreparatory platforms for molecular diagnostic assays have been performed by our group and many others . cytopathology specimen preparation is diverse and versatile the consequence of this is that each type of cytologic analyte platform needs to be carefully validated for any given molecular test . cytologic direct smears may ultimately prove to be the cytologic platform best suited for pcr based analysis due to the high quality of nucleic acids and immediate nature of specimen assessment for tumor cell adequacy . furthermore the tumor cells of interest can be directly visualized on the direct smear and isolated for nucleic acid extraction and molecular analysis in essence what you see is what you get . we have previously demonstrated that uncoverslipped and previously coverslipped decoverslipped diff quik stained smears are robust sources of cellular material for pcr based mutational analysis such as egfr mutation testing of lung adenocarcinoma and braf mutation testing of metastatic melanoma fna specimens . in our experience 100 to 200 tumor cells are sufficient for successful dna isolation and egfr mutation analysis and this is congruent with the observations from others . lbc samples have also been investigated for egfr mutation testing and have been shown to be an effective analyte for this purpose . tumor cells can be isolated from the thinprep slide and used for dna isolation and egfr mutation analysis . furthermore the cell suspension aliquot that is not used to prepare a thinprep slide can be centrifuged and the cell pellet itself can be used as an analyte for mutation testing 38 40 . based on these studies the authors speculated that coupling the use of highly sensitive egfr mutation detection assays and cytolyt derived cell pellets may be sufficient obviating the need for microscopy . in this regard the utilization of microscopy still remains an essential pre analytic quality assurance activity to best ensure that the input analyte is of sufficient tumor cellularity to maximize confidence in the results of the mutation assay . fish is currently the preferred approach to assaying lung adenocarcinomas for alk rearrangements according to expert recommendations based on review of the literature . typically up to 100 tumor cell nuclei are scored in this assay and a lung adenocarcinoma is considered positive for the alk rearrangement if at least 15 of the nuclei are scored as positive for the rearrangement . in our study we demonstrated the effective use of diff quik stained direct smears for this purpose and observed that the performance of this assay using direct smears was better than the performance using cell blocks . also examined the use of papanicolaou stained direct smears and observed that the failure rate due to insufficient cellularity was significantly higher for cell blocks than for direct smears . the advantage of utilizing cytologic preparation platforms such as direct smears and thinprep slides for this purpose is that entire tumor cell nuclei are being analyzed . finally the application of reverse transcriptase pcr rt pcr to cytologic direct smears for alk rearrangement analysis has been recently reported . at our institution if the subtyping of nsclc is deemed to be challenging based on cytomorphologic evaluation alone immunocytochemistry is utilized we have demonstrated that this can be accomplished using smears as well as cell blocks .", " to assess the role of clinicopathologic features in survival of net gcc and srcc patients the outcome of cases reported to the national cancer

igg4positive plasma cells is the predominant type of kidney lesion 47 . high levels of igg and igg4 are striking and characteristic features of renal involvement such as multiple lesions with low attenuation demonstrated by contrast enhanced computed tomography are often evident 47 . although tin is the main feature of the kidney lesion in igg4rd some glomerular lesions have also been described and membranous nephropathy mn has been recognized as the most common form 48 . in previously reported cases of mn associated with igg4rd mn was diagnosed together with or after the onset of igg4rd 912 . here we report a case of idiopathic mn as a preceding disease before the onset of igg4rd . an additional immunofluorescence study of igg subclasses showed predominant positive staining for igg4 and igg1 and weak positive staining for igg2 and igg3 in the glomeruli figure 1c . it has been reported that mn is present in 7 of kidney biopsy specimens in igg4rd . in mn associated with igg4rd positive deposition of igg4 in the glomerular basement membrane has been observed either predominantly or together with other igg subclasses 812 . predominant deposition of igg4 often accompanied by other subclasses such as igg1 was one of the well known features of idiopathic mn . an anti pla2r antibody which has been described as a major target antigen involved in idiopathic mn and seen in 7080 of patients with idiopathic mn 13 1618 has been reported to be negative in all cases of igg4rd and also cases of mn associated with igg4rd 8 10 12 suggesting no involvement of this antibody in the development of igg4rd . the anti pla2r antibody is described as negative in all cases evaluated in mn associated with igg4rkd and was also negative in this patient although the result was obtained from the serum 3 years after the diagnosis of idiopathic mn and after corticosteroid therapy . interestingly the patient s total serum protein level increased gradually without any significant improvement of proteinuria or elevation of the serum albumin level table 1 and eventually the clinical symptoms and laboratory abnormalities of igg4rd became evident 3 years after the onset of idiopathic mn . currently idiopathic mn is defined as mn without any other disorder that could cause secondary mn with predominant deposition of igg4 in the glomerular basement membrane . however mn associated with igg4rd has also been revealed to be igg4predominant and interestingly the igg subclass of the anti pla2r antibody seen in idiopathic mn is predominantly igg4 . consideration for igg4rd in mn including systemic evaluation or measurement of serum igg4 level would be necessary in addition to the evaluation of the anti pla2r antibody and igg subclasses in the immune complex deposited on the glomerular basement membrane .", " ocular complications are among the complications of interferon therapy and include retinal hemorrhages cotton wool spots loss of color vision cataracts glaucoma and occasionally retinal artery or vein obstruction . written informed consent was obtained from all patients included in the study and then in addition to the medical and laboratory examination all patients were subjected to full ophthalmological assessment to evaluate the retinopathy associated interferon therapy . after the start of interferon therapy 16 out of 100 patients 16 developed retinopathy which was bilateral in 12 75 patients and unilateral in 4 25 patients . one patient not diabetic or hypertensive had cystoid macular edema this was the only patient who complained of the visual disturbance due to interferon . interferon associated retinopathy was first recognized in 1990 when ikebe and associates reported a 39year old patient who developed retinal hemorrhages and cotton wool spots following intravenous administration of interferon.12 the underlying mechanisms of interferon induced retinopathy are not completely understood . similar to other studies459 our study also shows that retinal changes usually develop within the first 3 months of interferon treatment a fact that may favor an immune etiology rather than a cumulative effect of interferon leading to the development of retinopathy . retinopathy developed by week 14 in most of the patients 1316 81.25 after the start of therapy and disappeared in the majority of the patients 1116 68.75 during the 48 week period in which the patients were receiving the treatment . this study confirms previous reports that retinopathy is a temporary and asymptomatic complication of interferon therapy .", " when nathan tested the supernatant from activated t cells he saw that it did indeed induce macrophage activation 2 . unlike previous signs of macrophage activation increased spreading phagocytosis and glucose metabolism this so called respiratory burst ifn had been on the cover of time magazine and recombinant murine ifn was found to induce macrophages to kill tumor cells 5 . nathan now a faculty member in zanvil cohn s macrophage factory at rockefeller university new york ny thought ifn might also activate macrophages to kill intracellular parasites . in a seminal paper published in the journal of experimental medicine in 1983 nathan was thus able to show that depleting ifn from unpurified t cell supernatants decreased the respiratory burst activity and the killing of intracellular protozoa in human macrophages .", " our observation of frequent mood changes and sleep disturbances in women in the premenopausal group prompted us to undertake a study of

they have positive effects on health such as fortification of host immune function suppression of diarrhea and inhibition of carcinogenesis.6 kimchi a korean traditional food is fermented by probiotic lactic acid bacteria.7 kimchi lactic acid bacteria are known to suppress the activity of carcinogen activating enzymes such as azoreductase nitroreductase 7dehydrogenase glucosidase and glucuronidase and inactivate or neutralize the cancer causing agents and pathogenic microbes.8 in addition the intake of lactic acid bacteria as part of kimchi improves bowel movement strengthens immunity ameliorates hepatocirrhosis and decreases serum cholesterol levels.910 among lactic acid bacteria identified during the fermentation of kimchi weissella lactobacillus leuconostoc and pediococcus species are known to play an important role in kimchi fermentation.1113 this commentary deals with anticarcinogenic effects of kimchi and lactic acid bacteria weissella cibaria and lactobacillus plantarum separated from kimchi which are known to be predominant in kimchi . animals provided kimchi extract showed in smaller tumor weight and decreased malondialdehyde formation compared to those of the control group.27 although there has been no general acceptance on how to define probiotic microorganisms lactobacillus species bifidobacterium sp saccharomyces boulardii and some other microbes have been thought and used as probiotic strains.28 these probiotic microorganisms have been used as food supplement in order to achieve health benefit effects of them . there have been many studies reported on the functionality of lactic acid bacteria in the fermentation process of kimchi and their importance in the health beneficial effects of kimchi including prevention of cancer.29 according to pyrosequencing analysis of commercial kimchi samples to identify kimchi lactic acid bacteria the genus weissella was predominant at 44.4 . among these lactic acid bacteria w. cibaria exhibited higher production of eps which indicates more acid resistance table 2.37 w. cibaria was reported to have anticancer activity immune modulating activity anti inflammatory activity and antioxidant activity . moreover a correlation between the amount of w. cibaria and the amount of ornithine in kimchi was observed.40 use of w. cibaria as a starter for food fermentation promoted the formation of ornithine from arginine which in turn provide health beneficial effects such as antiobesity due to high levels of ornithine in fermented food.4142 lactobacillus genus is a microorganism which does not

displays different ultrastructural and histochemical characteristics.1 glomangiomas are most commonly found subungually and are exceedingly rare in the head and neck.2 they account for only 0.6 of all nonepithelial tumors of the nasal cavity nasopharynx and paranasal sinuses.3 glomangiomas that induce paraneoplastic osteomalacia are even more uncommon with only one case reported to date.4 while there are several documented cases of oncogenic osteomalacia oo caused by glomangiopericytomas5 we present the second reported case of glomangioma induced osteomalacia and the first case documented in english . the endocrinology service initially diagnosed him with tumor induced osteomalacia caused by fibroblast growth factor 23 fgf23 which prompted an octreotide scan revealing a questionable area of enhancement in the pituitary . oo is a rare disabling and curable form of osteomalacia that affects both sexes equally and usually presents around 40 years of age.6 it is not well described in glomangiomas but has been detailed several times in relation to glomangiopericytomas and other soft tissue and bone tumors with more than 300 reported cases7 since its debut in 1947.8 it predominantly occurs in the context of mesenchymal tumors and is thought to be due to neoplastic overexpression of fgf23 . the nonspecific presentation of osteomalacia the obscure nature of the tumors that cause oo and the rarity of glomangiomas in the head and neck make this patient s diagnosis challenging . this report serves to increase the awareness of this uncommon pathology so that it may be considered and treated in future cases .", " in rare cases molar tissue traverses thickness of myometrium and leads to perforation and acute abdomen and invasive mole infrequently metastasis . this case reported about ovarian metastasis and uterine rupture with acute abdomen and involvement of omentum in metastatic invasive mole . locally invasive gestational trophoblastic neoplasia develops in 15 of patients and metastatic form in 4 of patients after evacuation of complete mole and infrequently after partial mole 2 . invasive mole is curable with chemotherapy but hysterectomy decreases the need for multiple courses of chemotherapy and in patients with heavy bleeding or sepsis for control of complication and stabilization chemotherapy is needed 6 11 . here a case with invasive mole after evacuation of molar pregnancy presented with acute abdomen and in surgery metastasis to ovary and omentum and parametrium was detected . in our hospital report of sample pathology given from first and

leptin deficient and dio mice providing further support that ceramide plays a key role in the development of insulin resistance . furthermore 3 weeks of myriocin treatment in dio mice improved hyperglycemia and whole body oxygen consumption rates in their mice despite no change in body weight compared with control treated dio mice which is consistent with our results in dio mice treated with myriocin for 2 weeks . in addition mice overexpressing diacylglycerol acyl transferase in muscle are protected from high fat diet induced insulin resistance and palmitate inhibition of 2deoxyglucose uptake in isolated muscle both of which are associated with an elevation of muscle tag and drop in ceramide levels 10 . our results support these studies as we show that obese insulin resistant mice treated with myriocin had significant increases in intramyocellular tag long chain acyl coa and dag but a dramatic drop in ceramide content . although it may be possible that our model of insulin resistance is inducing mitochondrial dysfunction it is highly unlikely due to impairments in muscle fatty acid oxidative capacity as the rer values in obese mice reported in this study are very close to 0.7 indicating that these animals have no trouble utilizing fat as an energy source . another piece of indirect support for fatty acid oxidation inhibition with myriocin treatment in dio mice is the observation that tag accumulated in the muscle of these animals versus their lean counterparts but not in control treated dio mice versus their lean counterparts . however the fact that adiposity and body weight were similar between myriocin and control treated dio mice suggests that this would not be a contributing factor to the higher oxygen consumption rates observed in the myriocin treated dio mice . although we believe that the changes accounting for the greater oxygen consumption rates in myriocin treated dio mice primarily reflect the muscle we can not ignore possible contributions from changes in other peripheral tissues such as brown adipose tissue and uncoupling protein activity . regardless we did not observe increases in hepatic ceramide content after diet induced obesity and myriocin treatment had no effect on insulin stimulated akt and gsk3 phosphorylation in obese mice versus their respective controls supplementary fig . moreover we reported no difference during a pyruvate challenge of fasted obese control or myriocin treated mice supplementary fig . 8 suggesting that gluconeogenic capacity was not different between the two groups and that the liver likely does not play a key role with the improved insulin sensitivity observed in myriocin treated mice . with regard to the findings in db db mice we report very similar findings to what we observed in the obesity induced insulin resistant mice and that treatment with myriocin also yielded a very similar beneficial profile . this suggests at least in this model that perhaps ceramide metabolites such as glucosylceramide are more important in mediating skeletal muscle insulin resistance than ceramide itself 49 . in summary we show that ceramide accumulation in skeletal muscle plays a key role during obesity induced insulin resistance whereas the other lipid metabolites such as tag long chain acyl coa and dag may not be as vital . last our finding that muscle ceramide levels are not elevated in db db mice but that inhibition of de novo ceramide synthesis still prevents their development of insulin resistance suggests the possibility that ceramide metabolites may also play a role in the progression of this disease .", " to determine whether an age related decline in resting metabolic rate and energy expenditure might contribute to the development of insulin resistance c57bl6 mice of 1214 young or 5258 middle aged weeks of age were analyzed using indirect calorimetry . 1a substrate use was altered slightly with reductions in rer indicating that middle aged mice used more fatty acid throughout the day compared with young mice fig . our data indicate that middle aged mice have a lower metabolic rate than young mice and that this might increase susceptibility to

unclear whether these processes are cross talked . molecular signals and pathways connecting inflammatory system and muscle degeneration may be the key to reveal the interactions responsible for the progression of sarcopenia . the interplay seems to exist between the mass loss of skeletal muscle and elevated systemic inflammation figure 1 . in turn inflammation aggravates muscle loss and fat accumulation in the aging skeletal muscle and further decreases muscle function and physical activity . the increase in chronic inflammation response associated with high level proinflammatory mediators as the extension of age has been considered as one of the diagnostic hallmarks and a significant contributor to aging related atrophy of skeletal muscle . given that the inflammatory response is a complex system cytokines are important not only as the indicators for mediating chronic inflammatory state through increasing protein degradation and reducing protein synthesis but also as the mediators for controlling muscle wasting by directly targeting muscle tissue . accumulating evidences over the past decade have demonstrated that those proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf il6 and c reactive protein crp cause a significant increase in aging skeletal muscle cells and play a key role in the complex network of inflammatory signals in charge of muscle homeostasis connected with aging related disability and mortality 31 32 . it is estimated that approximately 60 of human genes are regulated by mirnas suggesting that highly enriched mirnas in skeletal muscle play important roles in biological processes by gene silencing including aging process . the functions of mirnas can be achieved either by suppressing the translation of target messenger rnas mrnas or by promoting the degradation of mrnas thereby providing a powerful and sensitive regulator to tune gene expression and cell functions during the aging process of skeletal muscle . according to the analysis of mirna expression profiling mirnas are critical regulators for both proinflammatory cytokines and skeletal muscle function 82 83 . in order to elucidate which mirna is important in the production of proinflammatory cytokines in aging related muscle wasting mrna targets and specific roles in regeneration and protein synthesis in skeletal muscle need to be established . several tissue specific mirnas are known to be associated with the aging of skeletal muscle which are named as myomirnas and consistently identified including mir1 mir133 mir206 mir208 mir486 mir431 and mir499 8486 . although there is no obvious difference in the expression of mature mir1 mir133 or mir206 in skeletal muscle from younger adults an increased expression of these primary mirnas can be observed during aging and the effect of anabolic stimulus on the levels of these mirnas can be perturbed in the elderly . since inflammation is rather a broad concept there are some overlaps between mirnas involved in inflammation and aging . therefore cytokine associated mirnas appear to have central roles in both inflammation and sarcopenia . it can downregulate sirtuin 1 sirt1 gene expression as a regulator so that the expression of mir181a and its target gene is disrupted in aged skeletal muscle . moreover based on earlier reports showing proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf il6 il1 and il8 as the proposed targets of mir181a the reduction of mir181a can be responsible for an increase in the abovementioned proinflammatory cytokines in skeletal muscle during aging process . due to the upregulation in inflammatory condition in various primary disorders of skeletal muscle mir155 is identified as an important regulator of mef2a expression and exhibits its function in myoblast differentiation and it also plays a critical role in the regulation of inflammation that affects both innate and adaptive immunity . since a large number of mirnas have been identified in skeletal muscle the investigation of mirnas is a promising but relatively unexplored area for understanding the regulatory mechanisms of wasting process associated with cytokine expression and secretion in aging skeletal muscle . there remains a lack of understanding of individual contributions of various cytokines during the aging process of skeletal muscle because of their wide ranging effects on cell proliferation differentiation migration survival and apoptosis . although the central role of inflammation in sarcopenia and proinflammatory cytokines including tnf and il6 as the central mediators of skeletal muscle atrophy has been documented the roles of inflammatory mirnas in mass maintenance and functional development of skeletal muscle still need to be further explored and confirmed . whether mirnas can be used for the diagnosis of inflammatory involvement in the aging process of skeletal muscle proinflammatory cytokine associated mirnas such as mir146a mir181 and mir21 are frequently detected at a high level in skeletal muscle however their functions are still not fully clear . in conclusion the discovery of mirnas with regulatory capacity of inflammatory response during aging process of skeletal muscle will open a novel avenue for the diagnosis prevention and therapy of sarcopenia through effectively modulating inflammatory signal pathways .", " it is well known that

chromosomes . the constitutive heterochromatin ch in romaleidae is predominantly located in the pericentromeric regions of all chromosomes as observed in xyleus angulatus brasilacris gigas chromacris nuptialis radacridium nordestinum e phaeoparia megacephala souza and kido 1995 rocha et al . our results showed a great variability in the number and location of rdna clusters in both species whereas the histone h4 genes were highly conserved in number . probes were obtained by pcr performed according to ayres 2002 with modifications using genomic dna from both species and the primers 18s dnar

showed gc rich cma3 positive constitutive heterochromatin ch blocks in the interstitial region of only one medium sized bivalent m5 and in the pericentromeric region of the x chromosome in r. mariajoseae figure 1a . after fish the 18s rdna probe labeled a single site in the pericentromeric region of the x chromosome in r. mariajoseae figure 2a and three pericentromeric sites in the bivalents l2 s9 and s10 of r. nordestinum figure 2b . the 5s rdna genes were located in the pericentromeric region of the two largest bivalents l1 and l2 and in the x chromosome of r. mariajoseae figure 2c and in the bivalents l2 l3 m4 and m5 of r. nordestinumm figure 2d . in r. mariajoseae only one autosome pair and the x chromosome presented cma3 blocks which resembled the scarcity in gc rich regions of other romaleidae as two species of chromacris with a single cma3 block loreto et al . these data indicate a possible dispersion of the 18s rdna sequences which may have been caused by structural chromosome rearrangements ectopic recombination and transpositions cabrero and camacho 2008 . two points support this hypothesis the presence of a 18s rdna site in this pair in r. nordestinum which was considered as a megameric chromosome by rocha et al . the 18s rdna probe location in the x chromosome of r. mariajoseae could have resulted from a chromosome rearrangement such as a translocation or transposition that moved it from m9 to the x as a meiotic association between this chromosome and the megameric one has been described loreto et al . on the other hand 18s rdna sites located both in autosomes and in the sex chromosome have been described for example in xyleus discoideus angulatus souza et al . the 5s and the 18s genes co localized in the l2 chromosome of r. nordestinum and in the x chromosome of r. mariajoseae . similarly to what we observed in both radacridium species an extensive variation in 5s rdna distribution has been found in others grasshoppers in which species presenting single sites and extending to all chromosome pairs have been described loreto et al . these data reinforce the fact that the high conservation observed at the chromosome level including chromosome number and morphology in radacridium and other romaleids is not reflected at the genomic level . our results also contribute to the understanding of chromosome evolution patterns in the family romaleidae .", " to the best of our knowledge there is no previous report specifically comparing the role of hs crp in people with newly diagnosed dm with the criteria based on the 2hpg fpg and hba1c . therefore the aim of this study was to identify the optimal cut off points of hs crp in new onset previously undiagnosed people with dm diagnosed based on the current 2hpg fpg and hba1c diagnostic criteria . people with known dm or other systemic diseases who had hs crp levels of 10 mg l 95.2 nmol l or above were excluded from this study due to a possible infection . mean levels of hs crp in each of the new dm groups were further compared using univariate analysis after being adjusted for age bmi smoking and alcohol drinking and sbp and dbp . among people with new dm the highest hs crp level was in the group detected by hba1c criterion hs crp median iqr hba1c 3.45 3.82 mg dl 32.9 36.4 nmol l 2hpg 2.7 3.14 mg dl 25.4 29.9 nmol l and fpg 2.4 3.0 mg dl 22.4 28.5 nmol

with respect to age bmi waist circumference and ht the mean hs crp was highest in newly diagnosed patients based on hba1c criterion in both sexes . in women with newly diagnosed dm based on fpg mean hs crp level was comparable to those diagnosed with 2hpg but lower than the group diagnosed with hba1c p 0.000032 . women with newly detected dm based on 2hpg had also lower mean hs crp than those detected with hba1c p 0.000001 . in contrast men with newly detected dm based on fpg criterion had lower mean hs crp than those diagnosed with 2hpg p 0.017 and hba1c p 0.003 but mean hs crp levels were comparable in 2hpg and hba1c based new dm groups table 3 . the specificity and sensitivity of the optimal cut off points for hs crp to detect dm in women were for the fpg group 60 and 57 for 2.5 mg l 23.6 nmol l 2hpg group 60 and 54 for 2.1 mg l 19.7 nmol l and 65 and 64 for hba1c group 2.9 mg l 27.5 nmol l . the largest auc value for hs crp to detect dm was found in women and men when using hba1c women 0.700 men 0.656 . the positive and negative predictive values ppv and npv corresponding to the above mentioned cut points of hs crp in women were calculated as 58 and 59 for fpg 57 and 58 for 2hpg and 64 and 65 for hba1c and in men were 58 and 59 for fpg 58 and 59 for 2hpg and 61 and 61 for hba1c . in pizarra prospective study people with baseline hs crp 3 mg l 28.6 nmol l developed dm . our results showed that among people with new dm the highest hs crp levels were obtained in those identified with the hba1c criterion . as we did show a positive correlation between hs crp and hba1c it has been reported that people with dm with poorer glycaemic control had higher crp levels . reported that crp levels among middle aged people were higher in those with dm and ifg when compared with the healthy subjects . they reported a positive correlation between hs crp and hba1c bmi and homa ir and the number of ms components in people with new dm . however the highest hs crp among people with new dm was found in those identified with the hba1c criterion . it would be important to find out if people with newly detected dm with high hs crp require a more intensive therapy than those with low hs crp .", " here we summarized the clinical spectrum of m.3243a g mutation in chinese pediatric patients to define the common clinical manifestations and study the correlation between

significantly decreased compared with that at 7 days of hdt 6.14 1.94 vs. 12.98 4.99 mv f 6.84 p 0.008 . the proximal and distal latencies of the nerves and the nerve cvs were prolonged and decreased slightly compared with the parameters before hdt but were not significantly different . the current investigation focused on the electrophysiological characteristics of the peripheral nervous system and identified a significant decrease in the proximal and distal amplitudes of the cmap of the median and tibial nerves as early as day 7 of hdt . however there were no significant differences in the proximal and distal amplitudes of the cmap of the ulnar and fibular nerves at 42 days of hdt . we infer that the electrophysiological characteristics of peripheral nerves were under a transitory disorganization on day 42 of hdt . in this study the latencies of the nerves and the nerve cvs were not significantly different after hdt . in our study the most likely explanations for the lack of change in the latencies of the nerves and nerve cvs following hdt were that the 42 days of exposure to hdt was not sufficient to generate significant changes and the electrophysiological characteristics of the peripheral nerve fibers were under a transitory disorganization . moreover although studies have evaluated changes in muscle fibers and axon terminals under microgravity few studies have investigated these variables in nerve trunks . conclusively this study demonstrates that the cmap amplitudes of nerves are decreased under hdt in rhesus monkeys . moreover results of the present study suggest that rhesus monkeys exposed to hdt might be used as an experimental model for the study of ncs under microgravity .", " exertional chest pain recurred at 7 years after surgery

of the solution when antibiotics are added to the irrigating solution in order to prevent postoperative endophthalmitis.124 however the exact nontoxic concentrations of the antibiotics and steroids have not been fully investigated . besides irreversible damage to the corneal endothelium and corneal edema high concentrations of gentamicin solutions can induce retinal hemorrhage edema and obliteration of the retinal vasculature when injected in the vitreous resulting in optic atrophy retinal pigment degeneration or neovascular glaucoma.1718 in our case the toxicity of the gentamicin to the corneal endothelium was expected to be significant due to the fact that the concentration of the gentamicin injected in anterior chamber and corneal stroma was 40 times more than that of previously mentioned studies . in our case the inadvertent injection of antibiotics and steroids resulted in severe corneal edema from 12 to 4 oclock position involving the visual axis along with extensive descemet s membrane folds . in our case corneal edema and the descemet s membrane fold were probably due to inadvertent corneal stromal injection with high dose gentamicin and dexamethasone rather than injection directly into the anterior chamber . hansany and basu22 demonstrated that a 0.1 mg ml concentration of gentamicin was not toxic to the corneal endothelium until seven days postop but after seven days corneal endothelial toxicity was demonstrated for that concentration . therefore considering our case and this study we can conclude that immediate irrigation of the anterior chamber is important in preventing corneal endothelial damage when high dose antibiotics and steroids are injected in anterior chamber by mistake during cataract or other intraocular surgery . in our case we reported a favorable visual outcome with immediate irrigation of the anterior chamber with a balanced salt solution after the inadvertent injection of high dose antibiotics and steroids .", " cardiovascular disease is the most frequent cause 36 of mortality in patients with adpkd . we describe an uncommon case of a middle aged man with a spontaneous coronary artery dissection cad and adpkd . four cases were reported on the occurrence of a spontaneous cad in middle aged adpkd patients . predisposing factors for cad in adpkd patients are still undetermined especially in the absence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors . furthermore it is not known if arterial dissection is an extrarenal manifestation of adpkd or if is just secondary to hypertension . the estimated prevalence of spontaneous cad is 0.7 and it is in 2 of cases the cause of acute coronary syndrome . identified three groups of patients with cad i patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ii women in the postpartum period and iii an idiopathic group . considering these results and the high plasma renin activity and impaired nitric oxide release in adpkd patients we speculate that the vascular abnormalities are most likely a direct result of pkd mutations rather than a secondary cause of hypertension . therefore a spontaneous cad should be considered as an extrarenal manifestation of adpkd . the clinician should be aware of cad if adpkd patients present with chest pain or discomfort .", " different anesthesia methods and anesthetics have been recommended to provide a safe and optimal situation of motionless with a short recovery period in children undergoing general anaesthesia or sedation for external beam irradiation 37 . this report describes the accidental detection of a

society of anesthesiologists class ii with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia all was scheduled for radiotherapy . anesthesia was planned by the anesthetist and the physical examination was normal before radiotherapy . a more detailed history taken from the child s parents showed his history of chemotherapy during which extravasation of the chemotherapy drug had resulted in severe inflammation and

number of people in the holy places especially in the cities of mecca and medina and the massive pilgrim crowds in certain places at certain times causes infectious diseases to spread more easily . both viral or bacterial respiratory tract infections are very common among pilgrims in all age and sex groups and is regarded as the most common disease among pilgrims in some reports . to prevent these infections some preventive measures have been recommended for the pilgrims such as mandatory injection of tetravalent meningococcal meningitis vaccine recommendation to inject seasonal flu vaccine and using surgical masks . on the other hand each country plans and implements some specific measures to prevent and control these diseases among pilgrims . according to the current policies of the hajj medical center of iran before traveling any caravan common diseases detected among pilgrims are treated in the caravan itself or referred to the medical center if needed . considering that the level of presence in saudi arabia and the amount of contact with all types of viruses and bacteria are regarded as risk on the day of identifying each patient two pilgrims in the same caravan were randomly selected as control group . pilgrims with a past history of at least one systemic diseases including asthma diabetes mellitus hypertension copd and cardiovascular diseases were considered as having systemic diseases . considering that the level of presence in saudi arabia and the amount of contact with all types of viruses and bacteria are regarded as risk on the day of identifying each patient two pilgrims in the same caravan were randomly selected as control group . pilgrims with a past history of at least one systemic diseases including asthma diabetes mellitus hypertension copd and cardiovascular diseases were considered as having systemic diseases . during the hajj pilgrimage 32 people 9.5 of the cohort 338 pilgrims were affected by respiratory tract infections . distribution of factors affecting respiratory tract infections in hajj pilgrims 2010 sixty nine percent of the patients were treated with symptomatic treatment and oral antibiotics and 27.5 required treatment through intravenous antibiotics as well . the role of protective measures and other individual factors on respiratory tract infections among hajj pilgrims 2010 the multivariable logistic regression model showed that none of the factors listed above were significantly associated with the outcome being studied . probably the close contact of the pilgrims with each other and their presence in crowded places are the main causes for transmission of respiratory infections so it hinders a possible protective role played by the personal prayer carpet . as can be seen in table 2 factors such as age sex level of education area of the room smoking systemic diseases obesity and the average daily hours of gathering together in the holy places have no effect on respiratory tract infections . do not affect the incidence of respiratory infections during the hajj and if this study is to be undertaken with a larger sample size according to the appropriate selected methodology some evidence will be obtained showing the prophylactic effect of gargling with salt water in the prevention of these infections .", " the objective of this paper is to explore the characteristics of

perforations ledge formation transportation of canal and formation of cracks in the root dentin . at times in the zeal of biomechanical preparation of the canal we inevitably end up damaging the root dentin which becomes a gateway to dentinal cracks and minute intricate fractures thereby causing failure of treatment . in different degrees dentinal damage can occur due to procedures like biomechanical preparation obturation and retreatment . complexities in the preparation of root canal may be attributed to variation in the design of the cutting instrument taper or composition of the material from which it is made . rotary instrument by its innate behavior in the canal may result in more friction which may increase dentinal defects and microcracks formation in comparison to hand instruments . and it was concluded that the design of the file affects strain concentration and the apical stress during instrumentation of root canal . whether it is rotary or hand files hfs they are assumed to cause limited frictional forces within the canal hence creating dentinal defects . so there is need to study the behavior of different niti rotary instruments and the newly developed rotary system ptn on root dentin . in the pt group the following sequence of pt rotary niti files were used for preparation of canals at 300 rpm the shaping file x for coronal enlargement and s1 s2 f1 f2 and f3 files corresponding to apical size 30 used at the working length . stereomicroscopic images showing dentinal defects seen in groups i ii iii and iv showing craze lines seen in group i. fracture and other defects in group ii craze lines and partial crack in group iii and craze lines in group iv in the present study in hfs pt hs and ptn the number and incidence of defects observed in the root dentin was found to be 115 6.67 615 40 1015 66.67 and 415 26.7 respectively . where the hfs showed no defect and pt rotary files showed highest incidence of dentinal damage 16 . in the presents the number of rotations required for complete root canal preparation is more with niti rotary instruments than with the hfs . stated that taper of the files is the responsible for increase of stress on the walls of the root canal whereas bier et al . stated taper of the files as one of the contributing factor for crack formation in root dentin . rotational force is applied to the canals of the root by niti rotary instruments thus creating craze line or microcracks in root dentin . thus it can be stated that design of the rotary files is not the only factor for defect formation in root dentin . stated that forces shaping the root dentin can be affected by the file design . thus such flexibility of ptn rotary files may have contributed in less number of dentinal defects formation as compared to pt and hs . concluded that the swaggering motion and less taper of the ptn instruments could change the root canal volume to an extent as that of the higher tapered instruments .", " the present work is directed toward the optimal design problems of multiproduct batch plants . in conventional optimal design of a multiproduct plant production requirements of each product and a total production time for all products are available and specified . the number the required volume and size of parallel equipment units in each stage are then determined to minimize the investment . formulation of batch plant design generally involves mathematical programming methods such as linear programming lp nonlinear programming nlp mixed integer linear programming milp or mixed integer nonlinear programming minlp . however in reality the multiproduct design problem can be formulated as a multiobjective design optimization problem in which one seeks to minimize investment operation cost and total production time and simultaneously to maximize the revenue . recall that not much work has been reported in the literature on the multiobjective optimal design of a multiproduct batch plant . in the case of multiple objectives an optimum solution with respect to all objectives may not exist . the presence of multiple objectives in a problem usually gives rise to a family of nondominated solutions largely known as pareto optimal solutions where each objective component of any solution along the pareto front can only be improved by degrading at least one of its other objective components . promethee ii preference ranking organisation method for enrichment evaluations2nd version is a popular decision method that has been successfully applied in the selection of the final solution of multiobjective optimization problems . pareto dominance is used to exploit the search space in the direction of the pareto front and niching technique explores the search space along the front to keep diversity . the well known algorithms in this category include multiobjective genetic algorithm moga niched pareto genetic algorithm npga strength pareto evolutionary algorithm spea multiobjective evolutionary algorithm moea the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga proposed by srinivas and deb was one of the first evolutionary algorithm for solving multiobjective optimization problems . in the conventional design of a multiproduct batch plant one seeks to minimize the investment cost by determining the optimal number required volume and size of parallel equipment units in each stage for a specified production requirement of each product and the total production time . however in reality the designer considers not only minimizing the investment but also minimizing the operation cost and total production time while maximizing the revenue simultaneously 1maxnj vj bi tli qi h revenue f1i1ncpiqi 2minnj vj bi tli qi hinvestment cost f2j1mnjjvjbj 3minnj vj bi tli qi h operation cost f3i1n j1mcejqjbicoiqi 4minnj vj bi tli qi h total production time f4h . so the multiobjective problem consists of determining the following parameters nj the number of parallel units in stage j vj the required volume of a unit in stage j bi size of the batch of product i at the end of the m stages tli the cycle time for product i qi the production requirement of product i and h the total production time while satisfying certain constraints such as volume time and so forth . in contrast to the simple genetic algorithms that look for the unique solution the multiobjective genetic algorithm tries to find as many elements of the pareto set as possible . in a brief form the functioning of the multiobjective genetic algorithm nsga ii can be described through the following steps . there is also an operator called crowded comparison n which guides to the genetic algorithm towards the pareto optimal front in accordance with the following criterion 9in j if irank jrankor irank jrank and ididtance jdistance . there is also an operator called crowded comparison n which guides to the genetic algorithm towards the pareto optimal front in accordance with the following criterion 9in j if irank jrankor irank jrank and ididtance jdistance . the large set of multiple optimal solutions provides the decision maker with immediate information about the relationship among the several objective criteria and a set of feasible solutions . the batch plant in this case consists of four processing stages to manufacture three products a b and c with four objective optimization problem as expressed in 14 . for example the solution presented by huang and wang with unit reference membership level for all objectives f1 274 312 f2 375 688 f3 175 688 f4 5639 the solution 1 presented in table 4 of the present study improves the above solution f1 f3 f4 while f2 is comparable . a multiobjective decision in a batch plant process design is considered and a non dominating sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii is developed to get an optimal zone containing solutions under the concept of pareto set .", " however such implant arrangement is not

postoperative death and long time survival in patients undergoing surgery for hcc . there were 61 patients 44.9 in group a 75 patients 55.1 in group b 58 patients 42.6 in group c and 78 patients 57.4 in group d. all patients followed the same preoperative evaluation protocol including blood biochemistry ultrasonography and computed tomography of the liver . variables that might affect overall survival of patients with hcc after hepatic resection were analyzed in this study . the overall survival curves of hcc patients according to the bmi are shown in figure 1 . the overall and disease free survival curves of hcc patients affected by waistline were shown in figure 2 . the 1 3 and 5year overall survival rates of group c were 97 88 respectively and 15 compared to 96 68 15 respectively in group d. the 1 3 and 5year disease free survival rates of group c were 84 40 and 6 respectively . variables that might affect overall survival of patients with hcc after hepatic resection were analyzed in this study . the overall survival curves of hcc patients according to the bmi are shown in figure 1 . the overall and disease free survival curves of hcc patients affected by waistline were shown in figure 2 . the 1 3 and 5year overall survival rates of group c were 97 88 respectively and 15 compared to 96 68 15 respectively in group d. the 1 3 and 5year disease free survival rates of group c were 84 40 and 6 respectively . although many reports had affirmed that patient with higher bmi tend to show a higher incidence of liver cirrhosis there are few reports about the relationship between the bmi and the surgical outcome of hepatectomy for hcc 1517 . regarding the relationship between bmi waistline and obesity we hypothesized that waistline might be related to surgical outcome of hepatectomy for hcc as well . group c had better overall and disease free survival than group d and group a had the better overall survival than group b. this result showed that bmi and waistline are both independent prognostic factors for long term survival . in conclusion overweight and obesity have been shown to be significant predictors of an adverse long time survival after hepatectomy for hcc . waistline is more important than bmi in predicting the disease free survival of hcc after hepatectomy .", " their main function has been classically understood to kill invasive pathogens by a variety of potent intracellular microbicidal effector mechanisms 37 . nets are released by activated pmn by a novel cell death process called netosis which can be stimulated by a variety of molecules and invasive pathogens . verified that pmn which had released nets were still viable and retained their capability to engulf bacteria via phagocytosis . as such the first ever published study on parasite triggered netosis was published in 2008 by baker et al . several studies showed that pmn infiltrate intestinal mucosa in response to eimeria infections and are occasionally found in close contact to the parasitic stages in vivo 102 104107 . importantly muoz caro and colleagues proved nets also to occur in vivo in eimeria infected gut mucosa . enzyme activity measurements and inhibition studies revealed a key role of nox ne and mpo in eimeria triggered net formation see table 1 which is in agreement to bacterial fungal and parasitic pathogens 14 25 59 65 75 110 . since respective inhibitor experiments led to decreased parasite mediated net formation muoz caro et al . this finding is in agreement with data on t. gondii mediated net formation . referring to ca influx further inhibition experiments proved e. bovis mediated netosis as dependent on intracellular ca mobilization since 2abp inhibitor of store operated ca entry and bapta am binding intracellular ca muoz caro unpublished data but not egta inhibitor of ca influx from the extracellular compartment muoz caro unpublished data significantly blocked parasite triggered netosis . by antibody mediated cd11b blockage leading to a significant reduction of parasite triggered netosis bacteria and fungi netosis was reported as a lethal effector mechanism 31 42 . are obligate intracellular parasites the main function of nets rather seems to be the extracellular immobilisation of infective stages hampering them from host cell invasion . the same feature was reported for monocyte preexposed e. bovis sporozoites indicating that this leukocyte cell type also casts ets in response to this parasite stage and that etosis had an impact on parasite invasion . in addition pmn are capable of killing t. gondii tachyzoites via phagocytosis 118 119 . besides this effector mechanism human murine bovine and harbour seal phoca vitulina pmn additionally perform netosis in reaction to t. gondii tachyzoites figures 1c and 1d 25 26 . showed that netosis was triggered by tachyzoites in a parasite strain independent fashion as an invasion phagocytosis independent process . t. gondii triggered netosis had modest toxoplasmacidal effects by killing up to 25 of the parasites . considering the obligate intracellular life style of t. gondii and its enormous proliferative capacity in mammalian host cells parasite entrapment via nets might be of particular importance in vivo based on its interference with host cell invasion . as equally reported for several other coccidian parasites 14 23 t. gondii induced nets were also proven to be nox ne mpo and ca soce dependent and to be mediated by an erk 12related signalling pathway in pmn see table 1 25 26 . in the latter case a high proportion of pmn was found to be involved in netosis since up to 76 of encountered pmn were found to participate in netosis leading to the immobilisation of approximately one third of the parasites . besnoitia besnoiti triggered netosis furthermore proved as vitality independent process that was even induced by soluble parasite molecules homogenates though at lower levels . thus respective enzyme activities were encountered in tachyzoite exposed pmn and chemical blockage of these enzymes via inhibitors blocked parasite triggered netosis 28 59 . given that b. besnoiti tachyzoites mainly proliferate within endothelial cells during the acute phase these parasitic stages are released via cell lysis in close proximity to endothelium and are exposed to blood contents such as leukocytes . muoz caro and colleagues reported on nets being cast by both bovine and human pmn in response to c. parvum stages . parasite triggered netosis proved stage independent since it was induced by both sporozoites and oocysts figure 1b . in vitro infection experiments additionally showed the negative impact of nets on host cell invasion since infection rates were significantly reduced when using pmn preexposed c. parvum stages . in agreement with findings on eimeria induced netosis inhibition experiments revealed c. parvum triggered net formation as dependent on intracellular ca release and erk 12 and p38 mapk mediated signalling pathways . particularly pmn have been implicated in the immunopathogenesis of leishmaniasis 145149 and recent studies examined the potential role of nets during the early phase of the disease of different leishmania species . authors also demonstrated that the extracellular dna and histones found on nets were involved in the parasite inactivation killing process . during this early rapid leishmania triggered netosis in which net formation takes place after 515 min of activation without affecting pmn viability 29 68 the parasites are also being efficiently entrapped . seem capable of evading net killing by firstly blocking the oxidative burst activity of pmn or even by resisting microbicidal activity of nets 145 150 . 25 51 the viability of t. cruzi stages was not affected by nets but netosis significantly impaired the parasite host cell infectivity . in fact nets components as ne may affect t. cruzi infectivity since this enzyme appears to be involved in increased trypanocidal activity and in the reduction of trypomastigote release by prestimulated infected macrophages 30 156 . additionally the authors showed via antibody mediated blockage that t. cruzi triggered netosis is a tlr2 and tlr4dependent process . moreover the study showed that not only viable t. cruzi trypomastigote forms but also soluble antigens and killed t. cruzi parasites induced net release in human pmn . during the last years a vast amount of data on protozoan mediated etosis was published strengthening the role of this effector mechanism in the defence of parasitic infections . while a bunch of data is available on bacterial nucleases or other counter mechanisms taken together we call for more parasite related studies in the exciting field of etosis .", " the prevalence of new smear positive tb was estimated at 90100000 95 confidence interval ci 35145100000 in persons 15 years of age . in 2005 44.7 of the eritrean population was 15 years of age 11 which resulted in an overall new smear positive tb prevalence of 50100000 95 ci 1980100000 under the assumption of no cases in persons 15 years of age . two explanations may account for the large difference 1 the cdr derived from the tb prevalence survey is too high because of an underestimation of the prevalence of smear positive tb or 2 the cdr estimate published by who is too low because of an overestimation of the incidence of smear positive tb . in the national tb prevalence survey measures were taken to ensure high quality of the results e.g. estimation of the incidence of smear positive tb in eritrea is complicated by the fact that no data from tuberculin or prevalence surveys were available . furthermore for global tb control reliable information about the tb epidemic in africa is needed because 28 of the incident smear positive cases occurred in the who african region in 2004 2 . in conclusion the example of eritrea shows that a large gap may exist between available estimates of tb prevalence and actual tb prevalence in africa . national tb prevalence surveys in africa would help provide better information on tb prevalence and case detection .", " pcr amplifications for

targets see 7 8 . beside their proven clinical relevance for hormone regulated malignancies there is rather limited information on their pathophysiological role as well as their prognostic and therapeutic potential for head and neck cancer 7 8 12 2022 . as such ppar is overexpressed in many epithelial malignancies 22 28 29 including oral squamous cell carcinoma . agonist binding to ppar can induce cell differentiation growth arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells . additionally such activating ppar ligands were shown to exert antiproliferative on human colon and breast cancers details in 23 24 and were also suggested as potential chemopreventive agents for oral carcinogenesis 12 35 36 . paradoxically not only ppar agonists are considered as potential therapeutic agents in cancer therapy but also antagonists were studied in this respect . ppar inhibition was shown to induce apoptosis and anoikis and inhibit tumor cell invasion in squamous cell carcinomas . moreover one may speculate that the tumor modulating effects of ppar ligands are mediated indirectly by affecting the tumor microenvironment such as cancer associated fibroblasts or tumor endothelial cells . as angiogenesis is a crucial aspect for tumor development therapy resistance and metastasis and inhibition of angiogenesis may hence have contributed to the clinical benefit observed.in sum ppar ligands appear to be of clinical benefit for the treatment of head and neck cancer in particular for oscc . agonist binding to ppar can induce cell differentiation growth arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells

are characterized by their activation via vitamin a derivatives . upon activation rars are able to heterodimerize with retinoid x receptors rxr and to bind to specific hormone response elements hres thereby modulating transcription of target genes figures 3 and 4 8 26 46 . rar activation often leads to differentiation cell cycle arrest or apoptosis culminating in the inhibiting of tumor growth . hence its ligand retinoid acid ra or derivates thereof are currently tested as therapeutic agents in several cancer types table 2 . paradoxically in some malignancies ra rather promotes cell survival which may be due to the ability of ra to also activate ppars and as a consequence expression of prosurvival genes is induced . thus the channeling of ra to different receptor heterodimers appears to be crucial for the regulation of cell proliferation positively or negatively affecting tumor growth . in head and neck carcinogenesis hypermethylation of the rar promoter was found to be indeed associated with rar downregulation and hence appears to be biologically relevant . clinical aspects of retinoid acid receptors in hnsccas outlined above a rationale for the use of retinoids in chemoprevention and cancer therapy was provided experimentally by different cellular and animal models . current trials table 2 are therefore aiming to resolve these controversies by recruiting appropriate study populations as well as by the use of novel drugs and improved treatment protocols.reduced rar mrna levels have been observed not only in several malignant tumors 26 56 and references therein but also in premalignant oral lesions and references within . additionally there is evidence that retinoic acid induces the expression of rar mrna in certain cell lines but not in the malignant counterparts of these cells . hence rar indeed seems to contribute to the suppression of the premalignant phenotype and malignancy and may be causally linked to the clinical outcome in chemoprevention trials with retinoids 26 67 . rar modulation by its agonist ligand all trans retinoic acid atra represents a successful example of how targeting of an nr contributes to an impressive

solution to determine histopathology nfb activation and hepatic apoptosis . rats treated with ethanol and curcumin 400 mg kg bw a day improved the liver histopathology that showed only mild steatosis but not necroinflammation figure 1c . our results showed that the level of hepatic sod activity of the control group was 1081.36 145.01 units mg protein while that of the ethanol treated group was 1135.86 209.48 units mg protein . in rats treated with ethanol and curcumin 400 or 1200 mg kg bw a day the levels of hepatic sod activity were 966.28 139.44 and 967.84 116.66 units mg protein respectively . the number of positive stained cells in the liver of ethanol treated group was significantly higher than control group 1.08 0.52 versus 0.04 0.04 cells high power field p .05 . in order to examine the change of ppar protein expression in early stage of ethanol induced liver injury the ppar protein expression in control group was 0.57 0.19 and ethanol group was 0.68 0.16 . rats treated with ethanol and curcumin 400 or 1200 mg kg bw a day had 0.44 0.03 and 0.54 0.23 respectively . we found that an increase in hepatic mda level as well as pathological changes were observed in ethanol treated group . decreased sod activity in ethanol fed rats was associated with enhancement of lipid peroxidation and severe pathology of liver . therefore the sod activity in liver did not change in early ethanol induced liver injury . evidence was presented that curcumin prevented ethanol induced liver injury in rats by inhibiting the expression of nfb dependent genes . although a high dose of curcumin treatment 1200 mg kg bw was not better than low dose 400 mg kg bw the present study showed that curcumin improved ethanol induced liver injury by reduction of oxidative stress and inhibition of nfb activation . ethanol induced liver injury has been linked to oxidative stress caused by the production of reactive oxygen intermediates that cause mitochondrial dysfunction leading to a release of proapoptotic factors such as cytochrome c that can activate caspases and initiate the apoptotic cascade in hepatocytes . in conclusion our study demonstrated that curcumin a representative phenolic antioxidant and antiinflammmation could improve histopathology of liver in early stage of ethanol induced liver injury by reduction of oxidative stress and inhibition of nfb activation . for hepatocyte apoptosis curcumin treatment might have a trend of decreased apoptotic cells in ethanol fed rats .", " this study provides class iii evidence that more patients are seizure free and have stopped aed treatment in the long term after resective epilepsy surgery than nonoperated epilepsy patients . in this study we analyzed seizure outcome and aed medication 5 and 10 years after resective epilepsy surgery in patients who had 5 and 10year follow ups in 2005 to 2007 and hence were operated on in 2000 to 2002 and 1995 to 1997 . primary research questions were as follows

80 . sustained seizure freedom 5 years after surgery varies in these studies from 15 and 27 to 52 which can be compared to 31 adults vs 36 children in our cohort of 86 patients with varying extratemporal resections . overall 44 of surgical patients were seizure free at follow up in 90 of the studies seizure freedom was reported at last follow up or last year compared to 12 of medically treated patients . the proportion of seizure free adults and children in whom aeds have been withdrawn after successful epilepsy surgery varies widely across studies . this prospective population based study contributes to this knowledge and supports seizure outcome data from prospective single center studies and also shows that a greater proportion of seizure free patients than in most studies had stopped aed treatment 10 years after surgery .", " national health organizations have also recognized the importance of clinician counseling and have called for an increase in the provision of both nutrition and exercise counseling given to adolescents during physician visits 15 16 . a recent study found that race was an important factor that explained the prevalence of nutrition or physical activity counseling among california adolescents african americans compared to whites were more likely to receive nutrition counseling while hispanics compared to whites were more likely to receive both nutrition and physical activity counseling . previous research in california suggests that physician obesity related counseling has been declining with overall counseling rates between 2003 and 2007 shifting from 75 to 59 for nutrition and 74 to 60 for physical activity . the objectives of this current study were to document trends from 2003 to 2009 in either nutrition or exercise counseling or a combination of both among california adolescents by race ethnicity and by insurance type . found that physicians offered dietary counseling to obese patients 41.5 of the time while exercise counseling was offered only 32.8 of the time . among healthy weight participants branner and colleagues found higher rates of nutrition compared with exercise counseling among children and adolescents 42.1 and 26.1 resp . data demonstrating trends in nutrition and exercise counseling by race ethnicity and by insurance type were obtained using four biennial california health interview surveys 20032009 the largest state surveys in the united states . in this study obesity related counseling refers to simple advice about nutrition andor exercise practices as opposed to more time intensive counseling . obesity related counseling proportions are presented graphically by race ethnicity and by insurance type for the period 20032009 . figure 1 and table 2 present data for obesity related counseling stratified by race ethnicity . between 2003 and 2009 the proportion of adolescents who reported counseling on both nutrition and exercise decreased from 66.8 to 53.7 among hispanics from 60.7 to 15.1 among american indians alaska natives from 61.7 to 33.4 among asians from 58.8 to 42.9 among african americans and from 60.0 to 46.2 among whites figure 1 . there appeared to be no imbalance in frequency of nutrition or exercise counseling for the uninsured low cost free or employer based groups except in 2003 when adolescents who were underinsured or had low cost insurance reported more nutrition than physical activity counseling . when examining nutrition or exercise counseling separately during the study period 20032009 interesting differences were found by race ethnicity hispanic and african american chis adolescents generally reported higher levels of nutrition than exercise counseling while whites generally reported higher levels of exercise than nutrition counseling . this is the first study to examine trends in obesity related counseling by race ethnicity and by insurance type among california adolescents . the findings from our study have demonstrated that the downward trend in obesity prevention counseling in california among racial ethnic groups and health insurance groups has changed course and has begun to increase .", " endodontics teaching can be considered complex difficult and stressful because of the complex anatomy of the root canal system responsibility toward patients and low self confidence . this study enrolled 41 undergraduate dental students registered in endodontic courses in the 2015 academic year at the college of dentistry taibah university saudi arabia . first endodontic case treated level of case difficulty and number of endodontic treatments performed self confidence of 4th and 5th year dental students regarding the steps of nonsurgical root canal treatment levels of confidence in the different steps of root canal treatment confidence levels differed significantly between 4 and 5year students in the following steps of root canal treatment determining the working length taking and interpreting radiographs during root canal treatment evaluating the quality of root canal obturation and recalling the patients periodically in the correct manner . this study obtained information about the confidence of undergraduate dental students at taibah university saudi arabia regarding endodontics . the number of teeth treated by students in the 4 and 5 year did not meet the recommendations of the european society of endodontology 2001 guidelines which advised that for adequate competency a student should complete root canal treatments in 20 teeth . although the european society of endodontology published new undergraduate curriculum guidelines for endodontology in 2013 these focused on the quality and consistency of student performance more than simply the quantity of clinical exposure . in our study we observed that confidence varied according to both the year the student was in and the practical steps of nonsurgical root canal treatment . introducing advances in endodontics into undergraduate training such as niti rotary instruments may improve the clinical experience of students and their self confidence because it will help increase the numbers of cases treated . changing the methods of teaching endodontics so that students can complete root canal treatment more easily and quickly with minimal procedural accidents will improve clinical outcomes . endodontics education should be improved by increasing preclinical and clinical sessions and using new teaching methods that introduce recent advances in endodontics in the undergraduate curriculum .", " her younger brother aged 40 years old also had progressive generalized myoclonus which was detected 6 years ago at age 34 years figure 1 . she did not have gaze palsy and her vision and hearing were normal however her voice was tremulous and generalized positive myoclonus was observed at four extremities and body . type i sialidosis is typically found in patients aged 8 to 25 years and is characterized by cherry red spot myoclonus seizure neuropathy corneal clouding and difficulty walking but with normal vision and intelligence obrien 1978 . a similar case of progressive myoclonic

age was older than the previous report 27 versus 13 years adult versus juvenile onset 2 the patient had a sibling with same disease which indicated she had inherited disease but the patient in previous report did not have familial history 3 the patient in our report did not have a history of seizure and it is different from the patient with myoclonic epilepsy .", " xpert mtb rif assay cepheid a real time automated nucleic acid amplification system is one such technique which detects mtb as well as mutations that confer resistance to rif in 2 h. it was installed in our institute guru gobind singh medical college and hospital faridkot in october 2013 under revised national tuberculosis control programme rntcp tb xpert project supported by who stop tb partnership unitaid . rif is a principle first line anti tb drug and rif resistance is a surrogate marker for mdr tb . the genetic basis of rif resistance in approximately 95 cases is the presence of mutations in 81 bp rif resistance determining region rrdr of the rpob gene corresponding to codons 507533 escherichia coli numbering system which codes for a beta subunit of rna polymerase of mtb . therefore this retrospective study was conducted to determine the frequency of rif resistance and rpob gene mutations among the suspected tb mdr cases of malwa region of punjab districts faridkot fazilka firozpur moga bathinda and muktsar area approximately 14981 km using xpert mtb rif assay . knowledge of the pattern of mutations present in rif resistant isolates could provide insight into the epidemiology of rif resistant mtb isolates of this particular area . out of 1612 specimens tested 1308 were positive for mtb by xpert mtb rif assay . of 1308 mtb positive samples by xpert tb rif assay 130 9.9 demonstrated rif resistance . the study of the association of epidemiological characteristics of the patients to the rif resistant tb showed that rif resistance was present in statistically significant higher number in previously treated patients in comparison to the new patients 95 ci 1.1487.135 p 0.006 and or 2.86 and in patients with afb positive sputum smears to afb negative smears 95 ci 0.91115.5 p 0.048 and or 3.7 . the study of mutation pattern of rif resistance in 130 specimens revealed that in 129 rpob gene mutations in 81 bp rrdr of mtb were detected by one of the 5 different probes a b c d e while in one specimen mutation combination i.e. out of 1612 specimens tested 1308 were positive for mtb by xpert mtb rif assay . of 1308 mtb positive samples by xpert tb rif assay 130 9.9 demonstrated rif resistance . the study of the association of epidemiological characteristics of the patients to the rif resistant tb showed that rif resistance was present in statistically significant higher number in previously treated patients in comparison to the new patients 95 ci 1.1487.135 p 0.006 and or 2.86 and in patients with afb positive sputum smears to afb negative smears 95 ci 0.91115.5 p 0.048 and or 3.7 . the study of mutation pattern of rif resistance in 130 specimens revealed that in 129 rpob gene mutations in 81 bp rrdr of mtb were detected by one of the 5 different probes a b c d e while in one specimen mutation combination i.e. by using xpert mtb rif assay we observed rif resistance which is a surrogate marker of mdr tb in 9.9 of suspected cases of mdr tb of malwa region of punjab . while detecting tb mdr cases xpert mtb rif assay showed 2.1 341612 errors in the present study . have reported 12 errors using xpert mtb rif assay g3 version 3 and g4 version 5 with more than half being contributed by the former version . the lower percentage of errors in the present study could be because that we used the upgraded g4 version 5 of xpert mtb rif assay . while using xpert mtb rif assay for the detection of mtb and rif resistance in mdr suspected cases we could collect additional information on mutations associated with rif resistance . too used xpert mtb rif assay and the most common gene mutations observed were in codon 531 58 followed by 513 25 526 8 and 511 8 designed by probes e b d and a. singhal et al . reported no specimen with more than one probe failure mutation combination while employing xpert mtb rif assay in their study . xpert mtb rif is a better screening tool for detection of mtb and rif resistance in a shorter period of time and this could help improve early recognization of mdr tb and prevention of its further transmission in malwa region of punjab . this assay also appears to be a useful technique to have simultaneous preliminary information regarding the mutation pattern of rif resistance in mtb isolates which could be helpful in understating the epidemiology of the disease and identification of hot spots for implementation of tb control program .", " in addition ana can also be considered as a screening test for samples that require further testing for autoantigen specificity that is dsdna and ena 2 9 . obviously a positive ana test must always be interpreted cautiously and only within the clinical context of the patient . in a clinical setting where the pretest probability of sard is generally low as in primary care the added value of a positive ana test is lower as compared to secondary and tertiary care situations where pretest probabilities of sard are often higher . besides data on ana prevalence also ana titres and anti ena and anti dsdna antibodies were included in our analyses . we hypothesize that ana prevalence ana titre and anti ena dsdna reactivity increase from primary to tertiary care as these situations are expected to be also associated with an increasing pretest probability of sard . these three populations consisted of patients who were tested for ana between november 2011 and august 2012 in suspicion of an autoimmune disease . all ana requests were considered to involve the diagnostic workup since none of the patients had requests for ana andor anti ena dsdna at least 4 years prior to the study period . if a homogenous ana pattern was detected testing for anti dsdna antibodies was performed by feia primary and secondary care or clift tertiary care . in the case of small samples of the three patient populations included 90 6.2 175 10.8 and 187 16.0 patients from primary n 1453 secondary n 1621 and tertiary care n 1168 respectively were tested positive for ana and were therefore eligible for the current study . the higher relative ana prevalence in tertiary care 16.0 versus secondary care 10.8 was apparent in all 4 clinical disciplines that requested the majority of ana screening test figure 1a this also holds for the other clinical disciplines data only shown as pooled results . within the positive ana cohorts patients from primary care had relatively low titres out of 90 positive ana tests 63 sera 70 revealed an ana titre of 1 80 . in the primary care 19 21.1 patients with positive ana n 90 were tested positive for anti ena andor anti dsdna antibodies that is 1.3 of the total cohort . in the secondary and tertiary care 68 of 175 38.9 and 40 of 187 21.4 ana positive patients revealed anti ena andor anti dsdna reactivity respectively . in secondary care the prevalence of anti ena andor anti dsdna reactivity within the positive ana samples was the highest in the requests from rheumatology figure 1b . in the present study on the analyses of ana prevalence ana titre and anti ena specificity in the primary secondary and tertiary care our results indicate that i ana prevalence significantly increases from primary to tertiary care ii low titres 1 80 are more frequently observed in the primary care and iii anti ena and anti dsdna specificities are significantly more prevalent in the secondary care than in the primary care . interpretation of the data obtained in the current study is highly dependent on the viewpoint on clinical utility of an ana test result . this risk of false positive interpretation will decrease if the positive ana is characterized by high titre and includes multireactivity for ena andor dsdna since these characteristics are associated with higher positive likelihood ratios 11 12 17 . next one has to realize that ana testing is performed in the context of multiple diseases varying from distinct sard to autoimmune liver diseases . this study however also has noteworthy strengths that is only data obtained during the diagnostic workup of patients not follow up samples were included and the same testing algorithm and reagents except for detection of anti dsdna antibodies were used for all three patient cohorts . in our present study ana was detected by iif in a screening dilution of 1 80 . in several studies it has been reported that 1015 of healthy controls are ana positive in this serum dilution 1 10 20 . on the other hand due to the high negative predictive value of a negative ana result furthermore since both high titre and anti ena andor anti dsdna multireactivity may increase the likelihood of identifying a patient with sard 11 12 17 it is apparent in our primary care cohort that 30 of ana positive sera are of medium to high titre n 27 21 contain anti ena andor anti dsdna reactivity n 19 and 37 of the latter reveal multireactivity n 7 . as expected the observed anti ena andor anti dsdna reactivity of ana positive sera in the secondary care 39 is higher than in the primary care . cardiology requested 108 ana tests 9.2 revealing 13 ana positive results of which 20 was anti ena andor anti dsdna antibody positive . our study shows that in secondary care the majority of positive ana results 92.6 as well as the positive anti ena and anti dsdna results 95.6 are linked to the departments of rheumatology dermatology internal medicine and neurology . in clinical settings with lower pretest probabilities ana positive sera are more likely to be of no clinical significance 13 18 19 . another alternative testing algorithm could instead of ana iif include solid phase assays including multiplex and screening assays for well defined anti ena and anti dsdna reactive antibodies 11 12 26 27 . altogether the results indicate that in the primary care the usage of traditional ana screening tests is more prone to false interpretation of positive ana results .", " the purpose of this pictorial review is to

was diagnosed but all grafts were acutely rejected . post transplantation ks is a well known complication after renal transplantation with a possible negative impact on the patient s and graft long term survival . the ks incidence peaks during the first year post transplantation . in our study 82.3 of all ks cases were diagnosed in the first 2 years after receiving a renal allograft which is compatible with previous studies . the results of this study showed lower incidence of ks 1.1 in our transplant population than that reported from other regional countries . further ks is frequent in african renal transplant recipients where 13.3 of all transplanted patients developed ks . we investigated the ks was the most frequent post transplantation malignancies . in compare to our study reduction of immunosuppression resulted in complete remission of ks in 28 of patients from saudi arabia and 61 of italian patients . sirolimus may become the first choice immunosuppressant in renal transplant recipients with ks for pro viding optimal immunosuppression and inhibiting the progression of malignancy . ks is a common long term complication in renal transplant recipients with an increased incidence compared with the general population . given that candidates for organ transplantation who are seropositive for hhv8 and thus at risk for ks can now be identified chemoprevention should be available in this high risk population .", " tlrs are critical in bridging innate and adaptive immune responses and play a significant role in cancer immunosurveillance . tlrs are known to regulate cancer immunity and tolerance by controlling the suppressive function of regulatory t treg cell and through innate immune responses mediated by other immune cells 1113 . tlr signaling critical for innate and adaptive immune responses has been thought to be restricted to immune cells . however many studies suggest that tumor cells bear tlrs and that tlr signaling promotes tumor growth and immune evasion 1517 . as tlrs are widely expressed on tumor cells and immune cells and play important roles in the initiation and progression of cancer they may thus serve as an important target and have an effective perspective on breast cancer treatment . the signaling pathways utilized by various tlrs differ which results in varied cellular responses . this seems to be a dynamic process in which inflammatory cells and immunomodulatory mediators present in the tumor microenvironment polarize the host immune response towards specific phenotypes impacting on tumor progression . there is strong evidence that the tumor microenvironment is inflammatory and that activation of the innate immune system plays a role in the progression of cancer 34 35 . recent evidence indicates that tlrs on macrophages may be critical elements in these common pathways . toll like receptors are expressed on cells of the immune system but there is growing evidence that tlrs are also expressed on tumor cells where they may influence tumor growth and host immune responses . activation of tlrs expressed on tumor cells may have profound consequences for tumor growth by factors released after tlr activation . recent evidence suggests that tlrs also contribute to tumor cell resistance to apoptosis and increased invasiveness . a significant percentage of tumors also showed tlr4 expression by mononuclear inflammatory cells 21.6 and tlr9 expression by fibroblast like cells 57.5 . tumors with high tlr3 expression by tumor cell or with high tlr4 expression by mononuclear inflammatory cells mics but not tlr9 high fibroblast like cells were significantly associated with higher probability of metastasis . this study highlights the importance of the tumor stromal cells in tumor behavior and how tlr induced inflammation on inflammatory cells drives metastatic cascade . activation of tlr signaling on tumor cells by their ligands can also trigger apoptosis and may have therapeutic effects . recently tlr5 has been found to be highly expressed in breast carcinomas and activation of tlr5signaling pathway was found to be overly responsive in breast cancer cells by inhibiting cell proliferation and an anchorage independent growth . inflammatory tlr signaling has also been shown to promote the attraction and generation of th17 cells induced by tumor cells and tumor derived fibroblasts . targeting tlrs will therefore in all likelihood prevent the induction of many immune and inflammatory proteins . since their discovery a decade ago tlrs have been shown to be critical for efficient innate and adaptive immunity and the framework of tlr mediated signaling pathway has been explained . however tlr activation may be a two edged sword with both antitumor and pro tumor consequences . the general expression of functionally active tlrs by tumor cells and inflammatory cells in the stroma by putative endogenous ligands suggests that tlr signaling may be continually activated and may contribute to tumor progression and metastasis . understanding tlr function in tumor biology may lead to discovery of new therapeutic targets in cancer therapy .", " the aim of this study was to determine the abo blood grouping and rhesus factor from dentin and pulp of extracted teeth using ae technique at 0 3 6 9 and 12 months after extraction . a dissected teeth samples b pulverized dentine and c dried pulp tissue a drop of 0.5 red cell suspension of known blood group a b and o was freshly prepared and immediately put into respective test tubes . abo blood grouping for dentin and pulp showed a gradual decrease in the sensitivity as the time period increased . abo blood grouping for pulp and dentine rh factor grouping for dentin and pulp showed a gradual decrease in the sensitivity as the time period increased up to 9 months . rh factor blood grouping for pulp and dentine when compared the sensitivity of abo and rh factor blood grouping of dentin and pulp in accordance to time period dentin and pulp showed almost similar results from 0 to 9 months . at 12 months both dentin and pulp showed vast difference in the sensitivities of abo and rh blood grouping with significant p value table 3 . comparison of abo and rh factor blood grouping for dentin and pulp the overall mean sensitivity of dentin for abo blood grouping is 88 and for rh factor blood grouping is 79 with a significant p 0.03 . dentin and pulp showed the p 0.58 for abo blood grouping and 0.46 for rh factor blood grouping table 4 and figure 4 . for abo blood grouping both dentin and pulp showed 100 sensitivity with the samples tested immediately after extraction and the sensitivity gradually reduced as time period prolonged . abo and rh factor blood grouping for dentin and pulp showed a gradual decrease in the sensitivity as the time period increased . at 12 months both dentin and pulp showed a drastic decrease in the sensitivity for rh factor blood grouping than the abo blood grouping with a statistically significant difference . the sensitivity of pulp was better than dentin in both the blood grouping systems with an insignificant p value . abo blood grouping was better than rh factor grouping in both the teeth components and the p values obtained were significant . this indicates that the antigenicity of pulp is better than dentin in both abo and rh blood groups and abo antigens were better expressed than rh factor blood group antigens . considering all the factors that support the presence of blood group antigens in dentin and pulp and also the pitfalls of false positive result or mistyping of blood group over a period in this study we came to a close consequence that the results obtained with pulp were better than that of dentine . on the basis of results obtained in our study both dentin and pulp are reliable sources of blood group determination for upto 12 months for abo and rh factor blood grouping especially where teeth ensues to be the only remnants existing for individual identity . although expression of abo blood groups and rh factor was seen in both dentin and pulp intensity of abo blood groups and rh factor was higher in pulp than dentin and abo blood group antigens were better expressed than rh factor antigens in both dentin and pulp . till date in english language literature no studies have been conducted to detect abo and rh factor blood group antigens from tooth material for up to 12 months .", " in western province of zambia hydatid cysts are reported to have been diagnosed from cattle carcasses during meat inspection although most of these reports are inconclusive . based on circumstantial evidence it is assumed that the disease has serious public health and socioeconomic implications given the interactions that exist between cattle dogs and humans and also the uncontrolled disposal of abattoir waste and remains from animal slaughters . the aim of this study therefore was to determine the prevalence of hydatidosis in cattle presented for slaughter at abattoirs in western province of zambia and assess economic losses due to organ condemnation using a cross sectional epidemiological survey with the view to identifying intervention measures aimed at reducing transmission of the disease between humans and different animals hosts . prior to commencement of the prospective study meat inspectors at the two slaughterhouses underwent an in house refresher training in recognition of hydatid cysts in various organs of the carcasses according to the procedures recommended by fao unep who 1994 . hydatid cysts where identified through visual inspection and palpation of organs during meat inspection and enumerated . a separate polythene bag was used for hydatid cysts obtained from one animal and was uniquely labelled and stored in ice before transportation within one hour to mongu regional laboratory for viability determination . cattle were classified as positive for hydatidosis if it was found with one or more hydatid cysts in any of the internal organs . 1annual lossnpsiluclunpsiliclinpsihechenpsikicki where nps total number of positive animal slaughter ilu

during the period under review was estimated at 3.0 table 1 which was close to prevalence observed in our prospective study . a review of the postmortem records over an eleven year period revealed that the distribution of hydatid cysts in bovine was highest in lung at 93.47 95 ci 92.7594.14 followed by liver at 6.55 95 ci 5.887.29 and spleen with the lowest at 0.02 95 ci 0.000.12 prevalence . out of this 84 2.1 carcasses table 3 were diagnosed positive for hydatidosis during postmortem inspections . there was variation in prevalence of hydatidosis according to the district of origin where cattle coming from mongu had the highest prevalence of cyst positive cases 2.5 compared to senanga 2.1 kalabo 1.4 and lukulu 0.6 table 3 . sex was found to be positively associated with hydatidosis p 0.035 with female cattle being more likely to test positive than males odds ratio 1.62 . on comparison of camps in different districts it was observed that in mongu the highest prevalence of bovine hydatidosis was in limulunga veterinary camp at 2.9 95 ci 1.44.4 with the lowest prevalence in luandui camp at 1.5 95 ci 0.53.7 . in this study we investigated the prevalence of hydatidosis based on pm findings at two abattoirs in western province of zambia . the observed prevalence of hydatid cysts in cattle sampled at the two abattoirs in mongu was found to be low 2.1 and was comparable to that observed during the retrospective survey 3.0 . furthermore the findings in this study were in agreement with that observed in a study done in sudan which reported a prevalence of 3 in cattle . similarly for instance rkia azlaf and allal dakkak reported prevalence of 23.0 bovine hydatidosis in morocco and so did kebede in ethiopia who reported a prevalence of 22.1 . in our study the distribution of hydatidosis varied according to district with mongu reporting the highest prevalence compared to other districts . sex was found to be positively associated with hydatidosis p 0.035 with female cattle being more likely to test positive than males . there was a significant difference in the prevalence of hydatid cysts between carcasses slaughtered in 2007 and 2008 p 0.024 where prevalence of bovine hydatidosis in 2007 was 1.3 95 ci 0.691.93 and in 2008 was 2.4 95 ci 1.82.9 . this could be as a result of more animals coming from areas of higher prevalence of bovine hydatidosis such as mongu and senanga in 2008 than in 2007 . however our results are at odds with the findings from a study conducted in libya where researchers reported higher prevalence in the liver than in the lung and al khalid 1998 cited by dakkak who showed that in libya 75 of the positive bovine hydatidosis cases were in the liver and 37.5 in the lung and 12.5 in the spleen . who did not observe any viable cyst from their survey and berhe who found a lower viability rate of 10.7 in cattle in tigray region of ethiopia . in this study the annual economic loss as a result of condemnation of organs due to bovine hydatidosis was low at k 15 894039.00.3311 us per annum . the loss was found to be low due to the low prevalence of hydatidosis in cattle in western province of zambia . this study has demonstrated that hydatidosis is an important disease and is endemic in western province . a molecular analysis of human and animal hydatidosis would be desirable in order to effectively map out epidemiology of the disease and determine the spread of the disease .", " these include deep neck infections lemierre syndrome and central venous catheterization cvc or cannulation17 . this is a life threatening condition and prompt management is essential to decrease the potential for thrombosis related morbidity and mortality . we report a case of internal jugular vein sigmoid sinus thrombosis due to a misplaced central venous catheter . postoperative chest x ray was normal except for malposition of the central venous catheter in the right internal jugular vein fig . malpositioning of the catheter tip may happen more often in the subclavian vein than the internal jugular vein . also positioning of the catheter tip in the subclavian vein is associated with a high risk of thrombus formation and vessel occlusion2 . when a cvc causes thrombosis the risk of catheter related sepsis may increase . subclavian or internal jugular vein thrombosis associated with indwelling catheters will propagate into other vessels but extension into the intracranial sinuses and veins is rare . three reports describe an association between cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and central venous hyperalimentation due to placement of the catheter tip in the internal jugular vein31516 . the authors warn of the potential for thrombosis due to retrograde infusion into the valveless internal jugular dural sinus system but also suggest that the small caliber of the vein may predispose to thrombosis . in our case we found the malpositioned catheter tip in the internal jugular vein on follow up chest x ray but it was ignored . the patient s condition worsened leading to thrombosis of the internal jugular vein secondary to sigmoid sinus thrombosis .", " these patients reportedly often develop bisphosphonaterelated osteonecrosis of the jaw bronj that is caused by subsequent dental surgery 3 4 . in general it is thought that nitrogencontaining bisphosphonates are much high risk of osteonecrosis than nitrogen notcontaining bisphosphonates . thus the american association of oral and maxillofacial surgeons position paper published in 2014 and the committee recommended changing the nomenclature of bronj to the term medicationrelated osteonecrosis of the jaw mronj to accommodate the growing number of jaw osteonecrosis cases associated with other antiresorptive and antiangiogenic therapies 7 . in this case report the patient developed mronj and died of sepsis although he received shortterm oral bisphosphonate therapy and had not received any dental surgical treatment because he was completely edentulous . to prevent steroidinduced osteoporosis he was treated with oral bisphosphonate i.e. his multiple systematic factors and mronj caused lethal sepsis because it fulfilled the diagnostic criteria previous treatment with bisphosphonate exposed bone in the maxillofacial region that has persisted for 8 weeks and no history of radiation therapy to the jaws . in recently years there have been many reports on osteonecrosis of the jaw onj caused by bisphosphonates and by other antiresorptive and antiangiogenic therapies 6 11 12 . bisphosphonaterelated osteonecrosis of the jaw to medicationrelated osteonecrosis of the jaw 7 . many reports indicate that the incidence of onj is significantly higher with the use of intravenous iv bisphosphonates such as zoledronic acid zometa novartis basel switzerland than by the use of oral bisphosphonate 3 15 . the incidence of onj because of the use oral bisphosphonates was higher in japan than in europe and america 16 . in this case thus it is thought that there were another option not to use bisphosphonate for such a highrisk patient or at least before administration we had to perform a risk assessment for mronj enough . physicians have to be careful with the use of bisphosphonates or other bone resorption inhibitors in patients regardless of the presence or absence of teeth or surgical history . physicians who prescribe bisphosphonates or other bone resorption inhibitors have to provide a detailed explanation to patients of the risk of mronj and consult dentists if a patient has even a small risk factor . there is a tendency to believe that mronj is caused by longterm bisphosphonate use especially intravenous bisphosphonate and dental surgery . physicians have to be careful when administering bisphosphonate other antiresorptive agents and antiangiogenic medications for patients with multiple systemic factors even if the patients seem to have no problems in the oral cavity .", "supported by nci 2p50 ca09825806 nci u01 ca168394 stand up to cancer aacr dream team translational cancer research grant su2c aacr dt0209 tcga gdac grant nih nci

received enhanced lifestyle advice had significantly lower on average 50 reduced incidence of type 2 diabetes compared with those allocated to receive usual care . individuals who were able to correct their lifestyle habits as recommended for usual healthy life patterns were mostly protected against type 2 diabetes . randomized controlled trials have unequivocally demonstrated that lifestyle management is highly efficient in the prevention and also in the early management of type 2 diabetes . this evidence of lifestyle modification in diabetes prevention is stronger than for most other multifactorial diseases . in the early randomized intervention study in malmhus sweden 19 lower rates of type 2 diabetes was found in igt men randomized to dietary intervention compared with those who received no therapy . more recently several trials have tested the efficacy of lifestyle intervention in prevention of type 2 diabetes . the results of the finnish diabetes prevention study dps provided the first convincing evidence from a proper randomized controlled trial that type 2 diabetes can be prevented by lifestyle modification 21 . a total of 522 individuals with igt were randomized to either an intensive lifestyle or a control intervention during an average of 3.2 years of follow up type 2 diabetes incidence was reduced by 58 in the lifestyle group . diabetes prevention program dpp 22 recruited 3234 individuals with igt and fasting plasma glucose 95 mg dl who were randomized to receive intensive dietary and exercise counseling metformin or placebo . after median follow up of 30 months the relative risk reduction in type 2 diabetes incidence was with lifestyle modification 26.4 with metformin and 28.2 with lifestyle modification and metformin as compared with the control group . the cumulative 4year incidence of type 2 diabetes in the intervention group was 67 lower than in the control group . the trials listed above have demonstrated the benefits of healthy lifestyle on delaying the deterioration of glucose tolerance to manifest type 2 diabetes at least as long as the intervention continued . more importantly after a median postintervention follow up of 3 years type 2 diabetes incidence was 4.6 and 7.2 per 100 person years in the intervention and control groups respectively log rank test p 0.0401 i.e. the absolute risk difference between groups increased during the postintervention period intensive lifestyle intervention for a limited time can yield long term benefits on type 2 diabetes risk in individuals with igt . in most of the published prevention trials the main aim was to see if comprehensive lifestyle intervention reduces type 2 diabetes risk . with compelling evidence that type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed strategies to implement the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes both in high risk subjects as well as at the population level are urgently needed . while type 2 diabetes prevention trials rigorously defined populations by explicitly characterizing their glycemic status these studies did not include all groups at risk for developing type 2 diabetes . this finding suggests that health promotion interventions that result in an increase in healthy lifestyle in the general population might significantly reduce the growing burden of type 2 diabetes . how to translate the results of the recent successful type 2 diabetes prevention trials to a real life setting 30 .", " in discordance other authors disclosed the presence of mechanical nrec in the articular disk of human tmj 78 also distinguishing receptors in capsulated and uncapsulated on the bases of morphological features . in all specimens such types of nrec have been detected by immmunohistochemistry table 2 a globular receptors with a thin capsule closely resembling ruffini s ones they exhibited strong immunoreactivity in their core for s100 nse and leu7 and were abundant in the superficial peri articular muscles and in the peri articular fibrous capsule b elongated onion like receptors with a thick capsule mimicking pacini s receptors positive for mbp s100 nse and leu7 particularly abundant in deep muscle fibres and in peri articular dense fibrous tissues c fusiform capsulated receptors morphologically similar to golgi s receptors located within peri articular fibrous tissues and ligament and fibromuscolar resections strongly positive for s100 mbp and leu7 and weaker gfap reactivity . in diseased tmj instead chondrocytes showed a different morphoology especially after s100 immunostaining they had an elongated cytoplasm with one or more thick dendritiform processes of variable length but with a strong reactivity only for s100 protein . nevertheless s100 positive cells in the articular cartilage of tmj bear rare thick and coarse cytoplasmic processes in which no one of the antigens commonly found in peripheral nerve fibres e.g. the results of our study indicate that free nervous endings described by other authors 3 8 are definitely proven to be nrec and it appears likely to stress that especially in pathological conditions chondrocytes and their prolongments might morphologically resemble nrec in the articular disk although their immunophenotype is rather different with the lack of expression of typical neural antigens . although immunochemistry can be easily used to study distribution and location of nrec in articular tissues we also suggest that ultrastuctural and immuno ultrastructural studies should be performed in order to definitely assess if chondrocytes is the exclusive cell type of articular cartilage or if also nrec could be present in tmj .", " with regard to their various employment opportunities and working

previous studies the eating habits are not different between patients with pcos and healthy persons but some foods seem to affect hormone parameters . in the year 2008 one case control study was carried out in al zahra hospital of the city of tabriz iran in which 60 women were studied the results showed that the intake amounts of ca mg d vitamin dairy fruits and nuts and seeds were remarkably low among the women with pcos . the frequency of their milk and dairy intakes products was also lower compared with the healthy women p 0.05 . have reported in 2002 that the amount of dairy intake and insulin resistance were indirectly related . as indicated in previous research diet and dairy intake which itself is a source of calcium not only can trigger pcos condition but also may directly affect obesity and insulin resistance two factors which themselves act as the causes of pcos . therefore however the number of studies which have addressed the relationship between dairy intake and pcos is limited . hence the present study intends to explore the relationship between the amount of dairy intake and pcos . as a descriptive cross sectional study the present research tried to find the relationship between the amount of dairy consumption and pcos condition in 400 women who referred to shahid beheshti hospital clinic in 2013 . the data on the history of developing ovary dysfunctions any endocrine disorders related to reproductive system genetics background having first related family members with ovarian disease the age of the first menstruation the history of thyroid diseases the patients medication history any kind of medicine used or any surgery the period of developing pcos and physical activity were collected by a nutritious expert using a self developed questionnaire . frequency and central tendency spread of some health condition characteristics of participants frequency and central tendency spread of food intake characteristics of sample population study as a descriptive cross sectional study the present research tried to find the relationship between the amount of dairy consumption and pcos condition in 400 women who referred to shahid beheshti hospital clinic in 2013 . the data on the history of developing ovary dysfunctions any endocrine disorders related to reproductive system genetics background having first related family members with ovarian disease the age of the first menstruation the history of thyroid diseases the patients medication history any kind of medicine used or any surgery the period of developing pcos and physical activity were collected by a nutritious expert using a self developed questionnaire . the prevalence of pcos in the persons in the study was found to be 9.9 . as for the history of ovarian diseases there was statistically significant difference between the patients with pcos and healthy people p 0.001 . a significant relationship was also observed between the use of medications and pcos p 0.001 . the results from using logistic regression revealed that there was no association between genetics and pcos p 0.13 table 3 . based on the results bmi and pcos were not significantly related but their relationship may be remarkable p 0.068 . after modifying the effects of confounding variables a direct significant relationship was found between the intake of milk and pcos p 0.028 so that every 1unit increase in the milk intake led to a 1increase in the risk factors table 3 . in the present study we evaluated the effects of dairy product on pcos . according to the results of this study no significant relationship was observed between each component of dairy foods group and other variables with pcos . very few studies have been conducted on exploring the direct effect which dairy foods may have on pcos . the results of empirical research on the effect of dairy foods on the weight which itself is believed to be one of the effective factors of infliction with pcos are inconsistent without producing a rigid and strong outcome . conversely it became evident that pcos and the history of ovarian diseases p 0.001 age p 0.001 and the use of medication p 0.001 as three confounding variables were inversely related . after modifying the effects of confounding variables a statistically significant relationship was observed between milk intake and risk of pcos p 0.028 hence that every 1unit increase in the amount of milk consumed caused a 1increase in the risk of pcos . the current study revealed that the average intake of milk and pcos had significant relationship . furthermore the individuals with pcos condition revealed to have a higher consumption of low and free fat milk . as per the results of the past studies there is a positive relationship between low fat milk and pcos . eating low fat dairy foods has also been accompanied by an excess of androgens secretion known as one of components of pcos . in contrast some strength points that can be mentioned for this study include the large number of the samples lack of similar study in iran directly addressing the relationship between dairy products intake and pcos evaluating the foods intakes using a validated ffq using sonography test known as the most reliable method for pcos diagnose . based on the findings of the study milk intake and prevalence of pcos may be related in some way .", " patients were divided into two groups based on the indication for milrinone treatment group a consisted of patients who received milrinone to prevent low cardiac output syndrome after cardiac surgeries whereas group b consisted of patients who received milrinone treatment due to acute heart failures from causes other than cardiac surgeries . patients with the following conditions or those who underwent the following treatments were excluded from the study 1 severe left ventricular outflow obstructive diseases such as aortic stenosis 2 hypertrophic or restrictive cardiomyopathies 3 milrinone administration immediately after cardiopulmonary resuscitation 4 multi organ failures 5 simultaneous administration of 3 inotropes other than milrinone to increase blood pressure 6 renal replacement therapies including peritoneal dialysis 7 myocardial infarctions 8 univentricular heart surgeries . systolic blood pressure heart rate and echocardiographic data the left ventricular internal dimension at end diastole ejection fraction and fractional shortening obtained before or immediately after starting milrinone treatment were compared to the values prior to treatment cessation . the safety of milrinone was determined based on the occurrence of adverse events such as hypotension arrhythmia chest pain headache hypokalemia and thrombocytopenia . patients were divided into two groups based on the indication for milrinone treatment group a consisted of patients who received milrinone to prevent low cardiac output syndrome after cardiac surgeries whereas

dimension at end diastole ejection fraction and fractional shortening obtained before or immediately after starting milrinone treatment were compared to the values prior to treatment cessation . the safety of milrinone was determined based on the occurrence of adverse events such as hypotension arrhythmia chest pain headache hypokalemia and thrombocytopenia . most patients 715 97.9 received milrinone to prevent low cardiac output after cardiac surgeries . systolic blood pressure fractional shortening and ejection fraction after milrinone treatment were significantly p0.05 increased in group a when compared to values obtained immediately after cardiac surgeries . however there was no significant difference in systolic blood pressure fractional shortening and ejection fraction before and after milrinone treatment in group b. in both groups heart rate was significantly p0.05 reduced after milrinone use table 4 . although diverse arrhythmias occurred in 75 10.3 admissions only 3 0.4 required reduction or discontinuation of milrinone infusion to alleviate arrhythmia . in total 41 58.6 of the 70 arrhythmias in group a were classified as junctional ectopic tachycardia the development of arrhythmia was not influenced by the initial infusion rate maintenance continuous infusion rate or duration of milrinone treatment . most patients 715 97.9 received milrinone to prevent low cardiac output after cardiac surgeries . systolic blood pressure fractional shortening and ejection fraction after milrinone treatment were significantly p0.05 increased in group a when compared

treatment in group b. in both groups heart rate was significantly p0.05 reduced after milrinone use table 4 . although diverse arrhythmias occurred in 75 10.3 admissions only 3 0.4 required reduction or discontinuation of milrinone infusion to alleviate arrhythmia . the development of arrhythmia was not influenced by the initial infusion rate maintenance continuous infusion rate or duration of milrinone treatment . the frequent use of milrinone in pediatric patients undergoing heart surgery was supported by the findings of the prophylactic intravenous use of milrinone after cardiac operation in pediatrics primacorp trial which demonstrated that low cardiac output syndromes could be prevented by high dose milrinone infusion after pediatric cardiac surgeries.10 although the initial and maintenance milrinone infusion rates determined in the present study were lower than those previously reported in the primacorp study our values were similar to those reported in other european practices.410 in terms of efficacy issue fractional shortening and ejection fraction were both improved after milrinone infusion in group a patients which is in consistent with previous findings.911 chang et al.9 reported that milrinone treatment in neonates with low cardiac output after congenital heart surgery improved the cardiac index without changing myocardial oxygen consumption . seven 46.7 of the 15 admissions in group b involved patients who died due to underlying cardiac disease itself reflecting the severity of disease in group b. in terms of safety several adult studies have shown detrimental effects of milrinone on hemodynamic stability in chronic heart failures . this result was in consistent with previous pediatric data that reported an infrequent occurrence of hypotension in the milrinone treatment group after cardiac surgery.10 milrinone use has been known to be associated with postoperative arrhythmia in adults that increased mortality and morbidity after cardiac surgery.15 arrhythmia is a concern following milrinone use in the pediatric population as well . smith et al.16 recently reported that approximately half of the pediatric patients receiving milrinone after cardiac surgery experienced arrhythmia . in the present study various arrhythmias occurred in 70 9.8 of 715 admissions in group a. however only 3 0.4 admissions required modification of milrinone infusion to manage arrhythmias . our finding is in consistent with that from other studies1718 indicating that the incidence of arrhythmia due to milrinone use in pediatric patients is relatively low after cardiac surgery . in the present study there was no significant difference in initial infusion rate maintenance infusion rate or duration of milrinone treatment between patients with or without arrhythmia in group b. in fact heart failure due to myocarditis or dilated cardiomyopathy itself increased the vulnerability of the patients to tachyarrhythmia and conduction disturbance.24 ichikawa et al.25 reported that 3 of 7 patients with fulminant myocarditis developed ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation . finally only a few echocardiographic data including ejection fraction and fractional shortening were used to evaluate milrinone efficacy due to the retrospective study design . if other echocardiographic data such as tissue doppler imaging findings were available a more accurate evaluation of the hemodynamic effects of milrinone would have been possible . this is the largest retrospective study to date to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long term milrinone use 3 days in pediatric patients with cardiac diseases . finally only a few echocardiographic data including ejection fraction and fractional shortening were used to evaluate milrinone efficacy due to the retrospective study design . this is the largest retrospective study to date to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long term milrinone use 3 days in pediatric patients with cardiac diseases .", " therefore most management guidelines focus on penetrating cervical injuries andor vertebral artery va injury12 . thus the treatment approach for wounds caused in non missile penetrating spinal injuries such as a knife a power drill bit or even a pen could be different from common missile penetrating injuries561317.to our knowledge there are few reports in the literature of complete obstruction of the va due to penetration of a foreign body through the neural foramen into the spinal canal . although vascular injury is the most common sequel of penetrating neck trauma va injury is rare because it is well protected by the transverse foramen410 . in this article we report a rare case of va penetration by an electric screw driver bit with spinal cord insult consequently presenting as bss . if a lacerated va can be successfully obliterated a penetrating electric screw driver bit may be extracted without general anesthesia . we initially tried to extract the electric screw driver bit manually without general anesthesia in the intervention theater after va embolization . on extraction of the electric screw driver bit the authors describe a rare case of penetrating cervical injury caused by an electric screw driver bit with accompanying va penetration and bss .", " exudative retinal detachment is a common cause of visual function impairment among vkh patients but secondary alterations in retinal morphology and function also occur 5 6 . changes in the is os junction the cost line and the rpe layer were graded by an experienced ophthalmologist chunhui jiang who was masked for the clinical and other findings of the patients . differences in mp and bcva between groups of late stage vkh eyes with different oct grading were examined using the mixed linear model test . the mean age at onset was 34.24 10.67 years range 1265 years mean bcva at onset was 0.96 0.56 logmar range 2.000 mean bcva at 12 months was 0.07 0.16 logmar range 0.40 to 0.08 logmar and mean retinal sensitivity was 17.05 2.35 db range 9.920 db . the oct findings in the late stage vkh eyes were localized to the outer retina . in 18 of the 51 eyes displaying fragmented cost lines grade 1 or 2 and in 16 of the 28 eyes displaying fragmented is os junctions grade 1 or 2 the central fovea remained intact figures 1a1c . our analysis revealed a strong correlation between retinal sensitivity bcva and the oct findings of the cost line is os junction and rpe layer all p 0.01 table 2 figure 2 . changes of the outer retina and rpe in late stage vkh patients including thickening of the rpe layer disruption or loss of the cost line and is os junction and thinning of the onl were clearly demonstrated by sd oct . further analysis revealed a close correlation between these oct findings which also correlated to the bcva retinal sensitivity and clinical characteristics . however the use of oct to identify retinal morphological changes in late stage vkh patients has not been extensively studied 5 7 8 18 . this study comprised a relatively large series of late stage vkh patients in whom oct clearly demonstrated retinal changes and rpe . in addition to defects in the is os junction and thickening of the rpe thinning of onl and a high prevalence 5158 of defects in the cost line were found thereby indicating that oct is useful in the observation of late stage vkh eyes . our study also demonstrated a strong correlation between the cost line andor is os junction integrity and visual function in late stage vkh patients . on the other hand it might also suggest that retinal sensitivity measured by microperimeter appeared to be able to provide a comprehensive and accurate evaluation of macular function in late stage vkh patients and might do the same in patients with other retinal diseases . in contrast only the costis os group exhibited normal retinal sensitivity normal bcva and treatment interval of 6.71 0.76 days . the primary outcome measures used in this study oct findings microperimetry retinal sensitivity and bcva are largely objective measures that are easily quantifiable . in summary our study demonstrated a significant correlation between the oct findings and visual function in late stage vkh patients as determined via bcva and microperimetry .", " to improve proteome coverage samples typically are fractionated at either the protein level or peptide level or both . a common observation when complex proteomes are analyzed is that the lists of proteins identified are often quite variable which has raised concerns about the general value of proteomics for most applications if it actually does have poor reproducibility . other strategies for increasing the number of proteins identified include prefractionating the proteome based on protein physical properties improving separation of the peptide mixture at the hplc separation step modifying the esi interface to enhance ionization or adding an ion mobility spectrometry faims interface before the ion trap.19 proteome coverage also can be improved at the data analysis stage by using high mass accuracy data20 or improved data process algorithms . it is now well established that repetitive lc ms ms analyses longer hplc gradients or additional fractionation via either more fractions or more modes of separation of complex proteomes will usually confer some benefit in terms of depth of analysis . because of its simplicity repetitive analysis often has been used to increase protein identifications after different fractionation schemes most of which involve two dimensions of separation at either the peptide or protein levels such as mud pit or gelc . to balance the total number of lc ms ms runs and total instrument time between the repetitive 2d method and the 3d method the 20 fractions from the sds page fractionation each were analyzed four times and the cumulative result was compared with the 80fraction proteome analysis using the 3d approach . these comparisons showed excellent reproducibility between the methods and substantially improved proteome coverage using the 3d method compared with the repetitive analysis of fractions from the 2d method . subsequently the final minimum consensus protein lists from the three data sets were compared to evaluate the ability of enhancing sensitivity of repetitive analysis and additional fractionation strategies . similar numbers of peptide and protein identifications were obtained for all individual 2d data sets data not shown . a total of 25 641 nonredundant peptides were identified after combining all four replicates of the 2d analysis which was 26 less than the 32 216 peptides identified by the 3d method . when protein identifications based on two or more peptides were counted the 3d method identified 3486 proteins compared with 2850 proteins for the 2d method . these 636 additional proteins 22.3 increase indicate a clear advantage of the 3d method compared with the 2d replicate run method even when equal amounts of mass spectrometer time are utilized . the proteomes produced by the 2d four repetitive run and the 3d methods were compared using the lists of proteins identified by two or more peptides . the 295 proteins that appeared to be unique to the less in depth 2d replicate run data set were further investigated to determine the basis for this apparent lack of reproducibility between in depth analyses of the same biological sample . a majority 135 of these 184 proteins were two peptide proteins in the 2d data indicating that the 3d method identified these proteins by one less peptide . when the unfiltered data for the 3d proteome was examined using randomly selected proteins in this group we found that a substantial number of these proteins had been identified by the same second peptide as in the 2d data set but one or more of the filtering parameters was slightly lower than the cutoff values selected for global data filtering . among these identifications the 11 proteins identified by more than three unique peptide sequences were a particular concern as the number of peptide identifications suggested that these proteins were not near the detection threshold and should have been identified in the more in depth 3d proteome . of the 385 peptides assigned to the 111 proteins unique to the 2d replicate run data set 226 peptides were present in the filtered 3d data the two methods identified 2555 common proteins with two or more peptides per protein 90 of the total proteins identified in the smaller 2d replicate run data set . of the 295 apparently unique proteins in the 2d method 184 proteins were identified in the 3d data set by one peptide . these proteins which were identified by two or three peptides in the 2d replicate data set were identified by a single peptide in the 3d data set . to a first approximation those proteins identified in the 2d repetitive runs data set by only two or three peptides can be regarded as likely low abundance proteins in the sample analyzed since sequence coverage is usually a rough indicator of protein abundance level . of the 394 common proteins identified by the 2d method with three peptides 325 proteins 82.5 were identified by an equal or larger number of peptides in the 3d method . these data clearly indicate that in most cases the 3d method had the ability to detect more peptides for low abundance proteins than did the 2d method . comparison of the number of peptides identified in the 2d repetitive and 3d methods . a among proteins common to both data sets 491 proteins were identified by two peptides in the 2d repetitive data set . the 3d method found an equal number of peptides for 174 proteins and more peptides for 317 proteins . the basic analysis platform used for repetitive analyses was the commonly utilized gelc ms ms method which can be considered to be a 2d proteomics method as it involves two dimensions of separation that is protein separation using sds page and reverse phase hplc separation of tryptic peptides . the repetitive analyses of 2d data showed increased peptide and protein counts figure 4 indicative of undersampling in the basic gelc ms ms method used here . the overall gain from four repetitive analyses of proteins identified by two or more peptides was 1061 59 compared to the initial single analysis . in analogous experiments where gel lanes were divided into 40 or 60 fractions we observed increases in the number of proteins identified that were similar to those obtained in this study for duplicate and triplicate analyses of the 20 fractions per gel lane data not shown . longer gels and larger numbers of fractions per lane were not used in the current study because we wanted to keep total mass spectrometer time per proteome approximately 160 h per proteome within practical limits while simultaneously matching gel lengths gel volumes and other parameters . that is using a larger number of gel fractions increases protein separation and simplifies the mixture of proteins present in each fraction while repetitive runs exploit subtle variations in peptide separations in replicate hplc runs and subtle variations in data dependent selection of low level ions for ms ms fragmentation and analysis . the 3d method clearly provided superior protein and peptide coverage compared with the 2d repetitive method which indicates that adding an additional protein separation step represents a more efficient use of mass spectrometer instrument time . this method identified 3486 proteins with two or more peptides which is 22 more than the 2d repetitive method that used equal instrument time . at the peptide level the 3d method identified 30 385 high confidence nonredundant peptides which is nearly 2.5 times more than that found in a single survey using the 2d method 12 160 and 28 more than the cumulative count in four repetitive analyses 23 648 . furthermore more unique peptides were found for most low abundance proteins in the 3d method data compared with the cumulative 2d method data figure 6 . it is not surprising that adding solution ief as an additional orthogonal protein separation step to a gelc ms ms method is an efficient strategy for increasing proteome coverage and sequence coverage of lower abundance proteins . one frequent criticism of proteomics methods is that the proteins identified on repeat analyses often are not very reproducible . a recent study suggested good reproducibility was achievable across 27 laboratories on a simple 20protein mixture after uniform data processing was used.35 but this simple sample of abundant proteins at the same concentration does not reflect real biological complexity . among four replicate analyses of the 2d samples this indicated at least 76 of the proteins observed in one analysis were reproducibly detected despite significant undersampling . reasons why these proteins were only identified by a single peptide in the 3d data set include run to run variations in automated selection of low abundance signals for ms ms and run to run variations in sequest scores coupled with use of rigid data filters . among the 385 peptides belonging to the 111 unique proteins in the 2d data although these 111 unique proteins comprised 4 of all proteins identified the 159 unique peptides were only 0.7 of all 2d filtered peptides .", " there is increasing evidence of a clear genetic link between the phenotypic characteristics of dogs and adverse drug reactions . this mutation results in altered expression of p glycoprotein and altered behaviour of the drug in collies and other related dog breeds . several recent pharmacogenetic findings have been shown to be clinically relevant for patients of veterinary clinics and the dog population is one of the most suitable models for examination of population genetics . single nucleotide polymorphisms snps have been identified as deficiencies in the canine cyp1a2 gene . this study was conducted to gain further insight into the characteristics of a breed or population and identify the snp genetic polymorphisms associated with the three genes mdr1 cyp1a2 and cyp2b11 involved in the metabolism of drugs used for medical treatments in several animals belonging to four different canine breeds . the snpstat programme has been designed to conduct genetic association studies using snps and to analyse moderate numbers of snps 26 dnps in this paper . the 26 snps examined in the 106 animals exhibited different frequencies in each breed table 2 . as shown in table 2 snp1 snp2 snp3 snp4 and snp 5 exhibited allelic fixation in the uruguayan cimarron and labrador retriever breeds . the haplotypes for all individuals were analysed using the snpstat programme which enabled estimation of the haplotype frequencies . although the number of potential combinations of haplotypes can be very high 2 the most frequent haplotypes those with frequencies greater than 1 included 12 in the cimarron population 19 in the border collie population 22 in the labrador retriever population and 18 in the german shepherd population . these haplotypes were compared to those of the control population while those that exhibited frequencies below 1 are included in the rare haplotypes section . the programme selected the most frequent haplotype as the reference while rare haplotypes were pooled together into a group . analysis of the associations of each snp were performed for the binary response variable and logistic regression analysis provided a summary of the genotype frequencies proportions odds ratios and 95 confidence intervals . according to the obtained results the following 10 of the 26 snps exhibited significant differences and were associated with drug sensitivity snp6 snp12 snp15 snp16 snp20 snp21 snp22 snp24 and snp25 of the cyp1a2 gene and snp26 of the cyp2b11 gene . all of these snps are potential candidates for studies of drug sensitivity in these breeds . the results obtained in this study revealed that three breeds border collie labrador retrievers and german shepherd exhibited several candidate alleles useful for investigation of genes that control drug sensitivity . our results indicated that the border collie labrador retriever and german shepherd breeds exhibited significant differences from the uruguayan cimarron breed in 10 snps of the cyp1a2 and cyp2b11 genes . different studies have examined the frequencies of several single nucleotide substitutions of canine genes that are associated with product resistance and drug sensitivity to survey other purebred populations that might be genetically at risk . the cyp1a2 gene of the beagle breed has been examined using the csnp method and a non functional allele that indicated that interindividual differences in the pharmacokinetics of cyp1a2 substrates should be examined in this breed was discovered . the analysis of these genetic marker snp candidates might be very useful before subjecting animals to drugs and other medical treatments because they are easily identified and the methodology is simple and inexpensive .", " on the other hand a patient arriving in the ed encounters repeated waits as he she progresses in different stages which may last for hours or even days . during the study period the investigator was stationed in the ed from 8.00 to 18.00 h. the data regarding waiting time the length of time when patient is waiting idle in the ed for delivery of the service he requires and inter arrival gap time gap between arrivals of two consecutive patients in the ed distribution was collected . background characteristics of study population arrival time pattern of patients in the emergency out patient department of study institute it was observed that maximum patients 29.6 were waiting under observation after preliminary diagnosis by the physician and their median waiting time was 16 h. the next highest category of patients 16.4 was those who were waiting for diagnostics tests and their results with the median waiting time as 1 h. the number of patients who had completed the treatment process and waiting for doctors decision regarding discharge from eopd was also substantial 14.6 with the median waiting time of 2 h. maximum median waiting time 38 h was recorded for patients waiting for their turn for operative procedure after the decision to operate . it was observed that waiting of around 71 of patients in eopd was attributed to factors within ed itself whereas waiting of 26 patients was attributed to the reasons outside ed but within hospital figure 3 . waiting time distribution of patients for various services in the emergency out patient department of study institute a waiting time attributed to reasons within the emergency department ed complex b waiting time attributed to reasons outside the ed but within hospital c waiting time attributed to reasons outside hospital with a steep increase in life style diseases and road traffic accidents the demand for emergency medical health care has been increasing . overcrowded eds and poorly managed patient flow results in excessively long waits for patients increase in the risk of inappropriate care and poor quality of services . the higher use of the ed in the tertiary care hospitals can also be attributed to many reasons such as increase in the illness and chronic diseases changes in demographic and epidemiological trends of diseases increase in acute injuries changes in people s perception about emergency need for health problems better quality of health services rendered and growing population etc . overloading of patient due to high arrival rate in peak hours and inappropriate staffing pattern may result in clogging of patients . the volume of patients attending an ed was observed to be a major determinant of the waiting time if resources are fixed . our study depicts that the factors influencing the patient flow do not lie solely in ed although waiting of at least three fourths of all the patients can be explained by the reasons lying in the ed complex itself . to tackle the random inflow of patients it was recommended that experienced staffing in the ed should be matched with temporal arrival pattern of patients . to tackle the

primary scc included chest radiograph cystoscopy colposcopy oesophagogastroscopy laryngoscopy and cervical pap smear which did not reveal any extramammary cancer . the characteristics of scc of the breast generally reported are a large sized tumor rapidly growing with a central cyst formed by necrosis . the possible mode of origin of scc is epidermoid cyst of the breast chronic abscess and complete metaplasia of glandular breast tissue . squamous cells in fine needle aspiration cytology fnac of breast lesions can be found in various benign lesions like epidermoid cyst subareolar abscess fibroadenoma infracted papillomas spindle cell metaplasia cystic sarcoma phyllodes pseudosarcoma and malignant breast tumors or metastatic malignancy . the benign breast conditions with abundant squamous cells may sometimes mimic malignant squamous lesion and vice versa . the differential diagnosis of malignant squamous cells in fnac of the breast includes primary scc and metastatic scc of the breast . in conclusion the presence of malignant squamous cells in fine needle aspiration of the breast suggests primary scc or metastatic scc . although the presence of numerous cyst macrophages in the background of breast fnac smears suggests a benign lesion when present with malignant squamous cells they suggest intracystic scc .", " third given the constant turnover within a hospital it is harder to mount disorder specific treatments because the patients will possess various degrees of comorbidity and might not fit neatly into diagnostic categories yet they may benefit from a cbt program . the first question to answer regarded the degree to which the outcomes reported in the published literature regarding group cbt for depression would generalize to this different format . to increase confidence in the presumption that any pre postchanges were associated with the provision of treatment outcomes were compared against inpatients who did not receive the cbt program and those who began the treatment but did not complete . the former provide an indication of the extent of improvement without the program but due to nonrandom assignment to conditions it is possible that patients with poorer outcomes were not encouraged to enroll in the cbt program . since cbt is aimed at changing emotions mood related symptoms should change more during the cbt program than at other points in the inpatient admission . they examined the effectiveness of group cbt for depressed i.e. excluding those studies that were not cbt the values improved the estimate of the treatment effect somewhat bdi before treatment of 25.5 to 11.6 at after treatment for clients with a mean age of 36 and a mean number of 20 therapy hours . a final benchmark was an outpatient evaluation of group cbt for depressed patients treated within diagnostically heterogenous groups . thus the aim of the present study was to examine the effectiveness for inpatients with depression treated with a cbt program modified to run intensively over a two week period . thus while patients may have had exposure to other treatments before or after the cbt program they were not engaged in any other treatment except concurrent psychopharmacotherapy at the time . first the change in symptoms from admission pre cbt post cbt to 6week followup was examined . the number of patients who demonstrated a clinically significant improvement from pre to post cbt i.e. although the changes during the cbt program are comparable to those in published studies one possible interpretation of the present findings is that the patients would have improved to the same degree due to their hospital stay . to partly address this concern the patients who completed the cbt program were compared at admission and discharge to hospital with those who did not begin the cbt program on the one hand and those who withdrew from the program on the other . follow up tests revealed no significant differences between groups at admission but the patients who had completed cbt were less depressed m 13.1 than those who never began cbt m 16.6 t611 2.56 p .05 who in turn were not different from those who had dropped out of cbt m 16.9 t516 0.10 p ns . to address the concern that the observed improvement may be due to the general effects of hospitalization rather than the specific effects of cbt the profile of symptom change from admission to pre cbt and then from pre to post cbt was examined . assuming a degree of symptom specificity of treatments because cbt is focussed on symptoms of depression and anxiety the changes in these domains should be greater during cbt whereas the earlier phase in an inpatient admission will be focussed on acute symptom management . to examine these issues the changes from admission to pre cbt and then to post cbt in individual honos items what is apparent from figure 1 is that the inpatient stay prior to entry into cbt is associated with small changes in anxiety and depression but substantial improvements in memory orientation activities of daily living self harm aggression and substance problems whereas the cbt program is associated with the greatest changes in emotional symptoms . given the data showing that symptoms of depression improved during the time patients were in the cbt program the effect on outcome of various clinical variables was examined . of the variables examined there was no difference in bdi scores between patients from pre to post cbt for whom the depression was a single episode or a recurrent episode f1146 2.37 .02 p ns or for whom the depression was judged to be primary or secondary to another disorder f1151 0.15 .001 p ns . although there was no difference in bdi scores before and after cbt between patients with more secondary medical conditions f6146 1.67 .06 p ns there was a hint that patients with more secondary substance use problems might have worse outcomes f3149 2.44 .05 p .07 . the present study examined the effectiveness for patients with depression of a cbt program adapted to an inpatient psychiatric clinic . thus cbt for depression can be adapted to an intensive program suitable for delivery within the model of care found in inpatient settings . in particular it is also clear that packaging a cbt program as part of an inpatient treatment program can deliver comparable treatment outcomes to spaced treatments but it did not achieve these outcomes at the expense of longevity of treatment gains . it is possible that the symptom changes that are observed during the cbt program may not be attributable to the program but due to patient selection and other factors associated with hospital care e.g. the difference between inpatients who began the cbt program and those who did not suggests that the cbt program is providing benefits over and above treatment as usual . the benefits by discharge for people who began cbt and finished it relative to those who dropped out address the issue that staff selected cbt patients who were likely to improve regardless of the content of treatment because those who dropped out were not different at admission or discharge from those who never began cbt . in addition the apparent specificity of the treatment gains that occurred during cbt speaks against arguments about the general effect of being in hospital as causing the reductions in symptoms . however while it remains possible that the treatment did not cause the observed outcomes given that cbt has been demonstrated to be an efficacious treatment for depression and the current treatment effects were comparable to those observed in the efficacy studies it is not unreasonable to presume that the application of an empirically validated treatment albeit in a modified form was largely responsible for the observed improvements . third the present study did not set out to establish the efficacy of cbt but to examine the effectiveness within a clinical setting and relied on the patients self reports and the judgments of the treating clinicians . that is the decision to treat a particular patient will involve a consideration of the self reported severity of the depression but other factors will also be taken into account and therefore the sample contains individuals who might not meet the criteria for inclusion in an efficacy study applying such a criterion by excluding them from the analyses if anything strengthens the conclusions of the present study since the pre to post cbt scores change from 28.4 to 13.2 increasing the absolute treatment difference from 12.5 bdi points when all patients are included to 15.2 points . despite these limitations it appears reasonable to conclude that cbt can be adapted to an inpatient psychiatric clinic and the effectiveness of such a program is comparable to that observed in more homogenous patient samples found in efficacy studies . however it is not clear from the present study the degree to which the apparent lack of comorbidity and type of depression to interfere with treatment outcomes is associated with the intensity of the treatment the setting of the therapy and the temporal location in the overall treatment program when cbt was delivered . another future research question could relate to the ability to deliver cbt to homogeneous patient groups .", " starting from the index date the date of the first diagnosis of rvo during the study period until december 2009 all subjects meeting inclusion exclusion criteria were analyzed to understand the demographics and treatment patterns of care . 73 of 47166 patients over 40 years of age with new diagnosis of rvo and a control cohort of 76077 patients were extracted for this analysis . examination of recorded episodes during the observation period by gender and age revealed the following only 8 of patients with a new diagnosis of rvo during this time were males between the ages of 4059 years compared with 43 of females in that age group . more rvo patients had hypertension 68 versus 14 or dyslipidemia 16 versus 10 than control cohort p 0.05 . one quarter of rvo patients had a history of vascular disease primarily mi and stroke . please refer to table 3 for data on incidence and type of rvo within the rvo cohort . seventy three patients over 40 years old with a new diagnosis of rvo were identified from 47166 patients over 40 years old . a few other studies have assessed the incidence of rvo . more males 92 over 60 years versus 54 females had the diagnosis of rvo . consistent with previous literature we found that patients with rvo were more likely to present hypertension dyslipidemia or vascular diseases compared with general population 4 1719 . given the close association of rvo with systemic vascular disease new patients with rvo should be evaluated for hypertension diabetes and lipid abnormalities as it may be the presentation of significant vascular morbidity . consistent with findings in other studies rvo in this patient population was associated with several vascular comorbidities .", " it has been well documented in medical literature that diabetes management during ramadan fasting poses challenges to the treating physician and pre ramadan diabetes assessment evaluations and diabetes education are important for successful management.1 this is because unplanned diabetes management during ramadan fasting may lead to hypoglycemia . hence in the past few decades efforts have been made by various researchers to manage diabetes during ramadan fasting without the risk of hypoglycemia . however this risk was significantly reduced when vildagliptin was prescribed during ramadan fasting and this has also been recently reported in indo pakistani populations from the uk and in cohorts of uk south asian muslim patients in the vector vildagliptin experience compared to gliclazide observed during ramadan study.4042 furthermore in general these agents have also been demonstrated to be safer in older age group.43 a recent observational study which combined metformin and vildagliptin therapy together with or without ohas during ramadan fasting has demonstrated advantage of reduced hypoglycemia incidence.44 they have shown one case of severe hypoglycemia in the arm treated with oha compared to the vildagliptin group which showed no hypoglycemia event . a recent review published in switzerland and france has studied worldwide the role of dpp4 inhibitors including vildagliptin during ramadan fasting and has come to the conclusion that the anti diabetic agents dpp4 inhibitors could be a more safer option while managing type2 diabetes during ramadan fasting with a very low risk of hypoglycemia.47 another prospective noninterventional study published in france to assess real life rate of hypoglycemia during ramadan fasting in patients with type 2 diabetes and their ongoing dual therapy of metformin vildagliptin or metformin sulfonylurea has shown that hypoglycemia as an adverse events aes was higher in su group as compared to vildagliptin group 17.9 vs 7.5 p0.025 and better compliance was seen with vildagliptin group.48 the virtue vildagliptin experience compared with sulphonylureas observed during ramadan study which recruited 1333 patients from 10 different countries worldwide has demonstrated significantly fewer hypoglycemia events as compared with su therapy 5.4 vs 19.8 respectively p0.001 . this is true especially in high risk population such as elderly and those with renal impairment or those who require insulin based therapy with metformin and dpp4 inhibitors.445256 despite the islamic rule of exemption most of the diabetic patients essentially fast during ramadan and this fact should be considered while managing diabetes during ramadan fasting.12 drugs such as dpp4 inhibitors vildagliptin should be selected with other diabetes medications as these are not associated with high risk of hypoglycemia . furthermore survey results have shown that 53 of patients fasted against medical advice.57 however this can be prevented effectively by extensive dsme and ramadan focused diabetes management ramadan education and awareness in diabetes read program and similar studies have demonstrated promising and good results in terms of minimizing hypoglycemia risk during ramadan fasting.15859 effective diabetes education for patients empowerment and motivation with self care awareness involves health care professional teams families the community and religious authorities as well.6061 additionally newer antidiabetic agents such as vildagliptin dpp4 inhibitor that are associated with lower risk of hypoglycemia are considered to be one of the safer options while managing diabetes during ramadan fasting and have also shown higher treatment adherence as compared to other medications.62", " they also suggested that progression can be true progression only in the cases of recurrence outside the radiation field or in pathologically confirmed cases if radiological progression is detected within 12 weeks when pspd is most prevalent . if the survival difference between etpd and ltpd are significant early progressive findings should be treated based on the assumption that the lesion would be the recurrent tumor . psr is the concept that represents temporary radiological improvement after using an antiangiogenic agent such as bevacizumab while having progression in effect . in the present study we evaluated pspd following radiation therapy combined with concurrent temozolomide tmz and also assessed psr following anti angiogenic therapy for patients with recurrent disease using criteria of the rano working group . bevacizumab with or without cpt11 was considered as a primary option for salvage therapy in all inoperable cases showing true progression . etpd and ltpd were defined as true progression found at first and second post treatment mri with the exception of pspd respectively . psr was scored when progressive enhancement or a non enhancing t2weighted lesion was shown right after response to bevacizumab or after discontinuation of the drug due to toxicity . bevacizumab with or without cpt11 was considered as a primary option for salvage therapy in all inoperable cases showing true progression . etpd and ltpd were defined as true progression found at first and second post treatment mri with the exception of pspd respectively . psr was scored when progressive enhancement or a non enhancing t2weighted lesion was shown right after response to bevacizumab or after discontinuation of the drug due to toxicity . and at second post crt mri 16 29 of them persistently showed progression and considered as etpd . five 9 of those patients showed progression after the first mri taken at post treatment 4 weeks and showed improvement afterwards without specific salvage treatment with a decreasing or stable dose of dexamethasone . and at second post crt mri 7 showed new progression that was not seen in previous mri ltpd . although 5 50 of 10 patients showed a radiological response following salvage treatment with bevacizumab the response was durable in one case and the stable state persisted for 11 months . for one case the mri scan showed decreased high t2 signal intensity 1 month after bevacizumab and cpt11 the lesion showed progression at the subsequent follow up and we considered this case to be pspd . for three other cases radiologic improvements were shown within 3 months and bevacizumab was continued until thromboembolic events in two cases and cerebral infarction in one case . all showed rapid regrowth of the tumor immediately after discontinuation of bevacizumab on mri fig . and at second post crt mri 16 29 of them persistently showed progression and considered as etpd . and at second post crt mri 7 showed new progression that was not seen in previous mri ltpd . although 5 50 of 10 patients showed a radiological response following salvage treatment with bevacizumab the response was durable in one case and the stable state persisted for 11 months . for one case the mri scan showed decreased high t2 signal intensity 1 month after bevacizumab and cpt11 the lesion showed progression at the subsequent follow up and we considered this case to be pspd . all showed rapid regrowth of the tumor immediately after discontinuation of bevacizumab on mri fig . thus we could not identify a statistically significant survival difference between the two groups indicating that it would be safe to continue planned adjuvant tmz rather than treatment for recurrence when radiologic progression appears in the first post treatment mri . this unique treatment strategy dealing with radiologic progression for high grade glioma comes from the absence of a diagnostic modality providing high accuracy and resemblance between in field recurrence and treatment response as pspd or radiation necrosis . in this case cbv was not increased and the tumor demonstrated stabilization after 4 weeks at the second post treatment mri which could be considered to be pspd . however as we had impression of both possibilities true progression vs. treatment related change we still can not rule out late pspd in this case . although small sized and retrospective in nature the present study suggests methodology and evidence for the safety of postponed treatment of recurrent high grade glioma until 12 weeks after termination of crt and shows clinical features of psr raising a question about the true effect of bevacizumab . additionally in recurrent high grade glioma bevacizumab must be administered with caution in consideration of pspd and psr . in addition to clinical correlation with adequate duration of follow up and histopathologic validation further studies regarding additional physiologic imaging modalities are required for accurate evaluation of tumor response .", " furthermore non invasive diagnostic tools for hepatic fibrosis and the management of hcc in patients after undergoing the fontan procedure have not yet been clearly established . furthermore the liver parenchyma had a coarsened appearance consistent with

factors for cirrhosis as she expressed negativity for viral and autoimmune markers no alcoholic consumption no hepatotoxic drugs such as amiodarone and no metabolic factors such as diabetes mellitus obesity her body mass index was 17.7 or fatty liver in us . the non cancerous area of the resected specimen revealed that bridging fibrosis was observed without fat deposition and the patient was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis fig . discussed that hepatic fibrosis after the fontan procedure was a mixed disease that affects both the portal and centrilobular areas in liver biopsy and autopsy specimens 67 . sinusoidal fibrosis is believed to result from an increase in central venous pressure transmitted to hepatic cells that surround the central veins because the extent of cirrhosis is strongly correlated with elevated hepatic venous pressures and a low cardiac index in patients after undergoing the fontan procedure 8 . non invasive diagnostic tools for hepatic fibrosis are needed because a liver biopsy the golden standard for diagnosing liver cirrhosis is difficult to perform in fontan patients due to prophylactic anticoagulation . similar to the present case a radiological assessment of liver fibrosis using various methods such as us ct or mri may be useful . we herein described a patient with hcc who was able to safely undergo liver resection following the fontan procedure under a preserved cardiac and hepatic function .", " this case describes a young non pregnant cat that presented with uterine prolapse in association with an unusual diffuse polypoid fibrosing perimetritis and parametritis . at the time of writing uterine prolapse in the cat is relatively rare and usually associated with the periparturient period . the polypoid inflammation affecting the uterus and parametrium may have contributed to increased laxity of the uterine ligaments and predisposed to the development of uterine prolapse . we report uterine prolapse in a non pregnant queen and in association with an unusual diffuse polypoid fibrosis of the perimetrium and parametrium . the perimetrium syn uterine tunica serosa is equivalent to the visceral peritoneal lining . from within the abdominal cavity the serosa of uterine body was noted to be diffusely thickened by multiple to coalescing white villous projections figure 2 . formalin fixed perimetrial surface of uterine body revealing diffuse to coalescing polypoid lesions there was a small amount of mildly flocculent abdominal fluid present . microscopic examination of the uterine body confirmed the presence of multiple nodular perimetrial proliferations of moderately loose connective tissue forming irregular polyps or plaques blending into the myometrium figures 3 and 4 . endometrium and uterine epithelium appeared unremarkable with a low glandular content intact mucosal epithelium and minimal to no inflammatory cell infiltrations . cross section of uterine body u revealing multiple polypoid perimetrial projections p haematoxylin and eosin polypoid structures blending with myometrium and containing a foci of angiogenesis and b regions of active fibroplasia haematoxylin and eosin uterine prolapse has rarely been documented in cats with individual case reports citing complete or unilateral uterine prolapse with or without uterine mucosal eversion . while an active lesion the extent of mature fibrous tissue would suggest the presence of this lesion in advance of the uterine prolapse . the unique perimetritis and parametritis observed in this case highlights an additional potential cause of uterine prolapse and warrants that in cases of uterine prolapse in non pregnant animals perimetrial and parametrial tissue should be evaluated for varying degrees of inflammation

property of the isolates was related to the expression of oxa23 and 51 p value 0.05 . in the current study all strains of a. baumannii were resistant to antibiotics in different degrees table 4 . isolates from icu and department of respiratory medicine had higher levels of antibiotic resistance than the strains from the surgery department . currently techniques for molecular cloning and detection are widely used to study the types of certain isolates 3 10 13 . two isolates st208 and st218 were found in the hospital and each one had its own territory this finding showed that a certain kind of bacteria would be dominant in a certain section . identification of the types and genes of the isolates in a certain ward would be important to restrict the prevalence . species isolates from blood culture had the highest level of antibiotic resistance . the study of the molecular epidemiology of these isolates from different wards and specimens were significantly important . besides further studies on the connections between the plasmid gene expression and types of the isolates are required .", " we previously reported that a high p diet increased rankl mrna expression and the osteoclast number in rats . it could therefore be deduced that high p diet induced elevated pth secretion leads to an increase in rankl expression which enhances osteoclastic bone resorption . we also found that a high p diet increased serum pth concentration in 12 24 and 80week old mice and 80week old mice had a higher serum pth concentration than mice at other ages . therefore it was thought that a high p diet strongly influences aged mice in terms of pth response . the purpose of this study was to clarify the mechanism by which a high p diet affects bone metabolism in older mice . we assessed the changes in bone metabolism in young and aged mice fed a high p diet by measuring the mrna expression of bone metabolism mediators using real time polymerase chain reaction pcr . in both young and aged mice although there was no significant difference in serum pth concentration between young and aged mice fed the control diet serum pth concentration was significantly higher in aged mice than in young mice fed the high p diet . in both young and aged mice the high p diet significantly increased serum oc concentration table 2 . in mice fed both the control and high p diets serum oc concentration was significantly lower in aged mice than in young mice . in both young and aged mice the high p diet significantly increased mrna expression of pth receptor rankl trap runx2 osterix alp opn oc and col1a1 figure 1 compared to the control diet . in mice fed the control and high p diets mrna expression of pth receptor rankl trap runx2 osterix alp opn oc and col1a1 was significantly lower in aged mice than in young mice . the high p diet significantly increased rankl opg ratio in aged mice but did not in young mice . in this study the high p diet increased serum pth concentration in both young and aged mice and was greater in aged mice than in young mice fed the high p diet . therefore the combination of aging and high p diet might be one of the reasons that higher serum pth concentration was observed in aged mice fed the high p diet . we previously reported that a high p diet increased rankl mrna expression and bone resorption in growing rats . therefore it was suggested that elevated pth secretion induced by the high p diet led to an increase in rankl expression which increased bone resorption . regarding mrna expression of bone resorption related molecules in the femora the high p diet significantly increased rankl and trap mrna expressions in both young and aged mice . in this study the high p diet significantly increased the rankl opg ratio in aged mice whereas the ratio was unchanged in young mice . our findings show that the high p diet in the aged mice leads to increased pth secretion and consequent increases in the rankl opg ratio accelerating osteoclastogenesis . from the results of bone resorption and formation markers high bone turnover with resorption exceeding formation since high bone turnover is a risk factor for bone fracture and osteoporosis a high p diet might be a risk factor for bone loss not only in young mice but also in aged mice . in conclusion we demonstrated that the high p diet increased bone metabolism related gene expression in both young and aged mice . furthermore the high p diet affected pth secretion differently in young and aged mice leading to an increase in the rankl opg mrna ratio in aged mice .", " studies indicate that children and adults with both mild and severe forms of cp have postural impairments678 . therefore why a specific child is not able to achieve sitting postural control is not always clear . cop has frequently been used to investigate postural control during standing by young children who are healthy or have cp9 10 . the purpose of this study was to investigate the differences of the pressure distributions of the sitting postures of typical developmental td children and children with cp . the purpose of the present study was to investigate the differences in sitting posture of children with cp while they sat on school chairs . it is known that dynamic postural control during sitting can be reliably assessed using cop data of infants who are developing typically or infants with or at risk of cp14 . the principal finding of this study is that cp children s sitting posture is asymmetrical leaning to the less paretic side . we thought that infants who are developing typically develop the ability to sit by exhibiting an optimal range of movement variability whereas cp may present either too much or too little variability leading to a very rigid and narrow or unpredictable set of movement solutions to achieve independent sitting .", " in this study alpha value was taken as one resulting in 3 levels lowest 1 middle 0 and highest 1 which is more specifically known as central composite face centered design ccfd in an attempt to optimize the variables incubation period initial ph incubation temperature and molasses concentration which affect bioethanol production . the model identified that within the studied range of experiments the quadratic effect of incubation temperature and the interactive effect of initial ph and molasses concentration and that of incubation period and temperature have highly significant positive influence on the bioethanol yield . that is with increment of both incubation period and temperature the bioethanol yield increases and the same occurred with increment of both ph and molasses concentration . but incubation period has a relatively low significant positive effect on bioethanol yield while the quadratic effect of initial ph and molasses concentration and the interactive effect of incubation period and initial ph as well as interactive effect of incubation temperature and initial ph have highly significant inverse effect on the bioethanol yield . the interactive effect of incubation period and molasses concentration and that of incubation temperature and molasses concentration have a significant negative impact on the bioethanol yield . initial ph incubation temperature molasses concentration and the quadratic effect of incubation period seem to have negative impact on bioethanol yield . thus bioethanol yield decreases with increase of the initial ph and incubation period incubation temperature and initial ph incubation period and molasses concentration or incubation temperature and molasses concentration . the relationship between predicted and experimental values of bioethanol yield is shown in figure 2 . the sharp curvature of the three factors initial ph incubation temperature and molasses concentration shows that the response bioethanol yield was very sensitive to these three variables . the comparatively semiflat incubation period curve shows less sensitivity of bioethanol yield towards the incubation period . the empirical predicted quadratic model for response bioethanol yield in terms of process variables incubation period initial ph incubation temperature and molasses concentration are plotted in three dimensional diagrams figure 6 to investigate the interaction among the variables and to determine the optimum condition of each factor for maximum bioethanol yield . figure 6a represents the effects of varying incubation period and initial ph on bioethanol yield at constant incubation temperature 38c and molasses concentration 18 wt . however increase in bioethanol yield occurred with an increase in incubation period at ph range from 5.5 to 6.5 . according to this interaction effects a significant positive impact is detectable that is bioethanol yield increased with the increase of incubation temperature and time . figure 6d shows the cooperative effect of incubation temperature and initial ph on bioethanol yield at constant incubation period 72 h and molasses concentration 18 wt . figure 6e illustrates the interactive effect of initial ph and molasses concentration on bioethanol yield at constant incubation period 72 h and temperature 40c . where bioethanol yield is low at both low and high molasses concentrations and initial ph . but bioethanol yield increases within ph range 5.56.5 and molasses concentration 1822 with maximum yield of 257 g l at ph and molasses concentration of 6 and 20 respectively . figure 6f represents the interactive effect of incubation temperature and molasses concentration on bioethanol yield at constant incubation period 72 h and initial ph 5.6 . it is obvious that with the increase in temperature the bioethanol yield increases reaching its maximum at 40c while at low and high molasses concentrations the yield decreases and increased within 1822 . accordingly the optimum working conditions and respective bioethanol production were established and the results are presented in table 4 . as shown the maximum bioethanol production was 255 g l at incubation period of 71 h initial ph 5.6 incubation temperature 38c and molasses concentration of 18 . rsm and ccfd proved to be reliable and powerful tool for modeling optimizing and studying the interactive effects of four process variables incubation period initial ph incubation temperature and molasses concentration of bioethanol production from batch fermentation of sugarcane molasses using locally isolated saccharomyces cerevisiae y39 .", " rpe association is supported by the fact that neuroretinas adjoined to rpe monolayer cultures have better preserved tissue architecture in culture studies . in this study we developed and characterized a novel organotypic coculture system in which the central cone dominated porcine neuroretina was cocultured with rpe cells that were maintained physically separated from the neuroretina by the culture medium and a porous membrane . nine neuroretina explants were cocultured with rpe cells but physically separated from them by the culture medium overlying the rpe cells and the transwell membrane figure 2 . schematic view of the

neuroretina tissue thickness a on day 9 of culture and on day 9 of coculture with rpe was reduced compared to the freshly isolated tissue . the thickness of the neuroretina cultures alone on day 9 was significantly less than that of the neuroretinas that had been cocultured with rpe . the onl b and inl c thickness of the neuroretina cultures alone on day 9 was significantly less than that of the neuroretinas that had been cocultured with rpe . at day 7 of culture in flasks the rpe cells were almost confluent in a monostratified epithelium had a polygonal shape and had pigmented cytoplasmic granules figure 3b . cellular characteristics were maintained until passage 2 when the rpe cells were cocultured with neuroretina explants . at coculture day 9 figure 3c the rpe cells formed a

neuroretina cultures alone on day 9 was significantly less than that of the neuroretinas that had been cocultured with rpe . the present study described the development and characterization of a novel coculture model of cone dominated porcine central retina and rpe cells to closely simulate ex vivo the subretinal space microenvironment . nevertheless these previously reported culture models lack the influence of the rpe cells that are necessary for maintaining the viability and functionality of the outermost retinal layers . other authors have previously described models in which rpe monolayers were cocultured in contact with the neuroretina . our purpose was to study and characterize the differences between neuroretinas cultured alone and those cocultured with rpe cells while physically separated from each other . this novel model could be the basis for studying the interaction between the neuroretina and rpe cells when they are separated in vivo because no such studies currently exist . in this model neuroretina explants were cultured over cell culture membranes that physically separated the rpe cells cultured on the bottom of the cell culture inserts . thus the porous cell culture membranes inhibit rpe cell migration into the retinal tissue and direct contact with neuroretina cells while molecular exchange among the different cell types can occur . in this scenario rpe secreted factors can diffuse through the cell culture membrane pores and influence neuroretina cell dynamics thus recreating the subretinal space milieu . cralbp immunoexpression was not observed in rpe cells cocultured with neuroretinas probably due to the loss of normal cell polarization especially seen as the disappearance of the apical microvilli . in the cultures in the present study the neuroretina explants without the rpe showed degenerative alterations in the tissue and retina cells as previously described . although rho and cralbp immunoexpression was better preserved and lower levels of gfap were detected in the neuroretinas cocultured with rpe cells we did not quantify the gfap or cralbp labeling and this will be part of future experiments . in any case the neuroretina explants cocultured with rpe cells maintained better preserved tissue and cellular characteristics and significantly better conserved tissue and nuclear layer thicknesses . based on the morphological and immunohistochemical results found in this study neuroretina preservation in cocultures with rpe cells may be partially linked to neuroprotective factors secreted by rpe cells . our group has developed and standardized a novel coculture model of central cone dominated porcine neuroretina that was supplemented with rpe cells maintained separately within the same culture wells . compared to the neuroretina explant cultures alone the presence of cocultured rpe provided improved neuroretina architecture and thickness better preservation of rho and cralbp immunoexpression and lower levels of gfap . these data suggest that the cocultured rpe while not in direct contact with the neuroretina explant had a neuroprotective role . our group has developed and standardized a novel

efficient technique in the management of small renal calculi in ectopic kidneys and it is a minimally invasive procedure with short hospital stay .", " however several in vitro studies have evaluated post removal with ultrasonic devices by using roots of extract teeth included in resin cylinders . however clinically the root is enveloped by periodontal ligament pdl which presents higher resiliency than resins used for root inclusion . this difference in resiliencies enables pdl to dissipate the ultrasonic energy more easily than when the root is included in a resin cylinder . the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of simulated periodontal ligament spdl on custom cast dowel and core removal using an ultrasonic device . the null hypothesis was that the spdl does not influence the action of the ultrasonic device used to remove the cast dowel and core from the root canal . in order to allow tensile testing without the root becoming dislodged the roots included in resin cylinder with spdl were fixed to cylinders with two stainless steel wires about 1 mm in diameter figure 2 . after the storage period half of specimens of each inclusion type with or without spdl were submitted to ultrasonic vibration . tensile strength means values in kgf sd necessary to dislodge the cast post and cores the influence of pdl is often omitted in in vitro tests that evaluate post removal using ultrasonic devices as opposed to other studies that evaluate the in vitro fracture resistance of restored teeth . samples included in the cylinder with the presence of spdl presented lower bond strength values than those directly included in resin when the ultrasonic vibrations were not applied . the tensile bond strength of the samples included in resin cylinders with spdl was not altered by use of the ultrasound device as opposed to samples included without spdl . the reduction in cast dowel and core retention with the application of ultrasonic energy has been demonstrated by several studies . by applying an alternating electrical field across the crystal these ultrasonic vibrations are transmitted through the dowel and core fracturing the cement interposed between the dowel and the root canal walls and facilitate their removal . considering that it is essential for the vibrations to reach the resin cement in order to facilitate dowel and core removal the root inclusion method may affect the efficacy of the ultrasonic device . the high rigidity of acrylic resin used for sample inclusion does not allow for root movement during the ultrasound application . the ultrasonic vibration had no effect on cast dowel and core retention when the pdl was simulated . the present outcomes demonstrate the importance of this simulation during in vitro evaluation to avoid overestimating the efficacy of ultrasonic vibration used for cast dowel and core removal .", " although hmpv infections have been diagnosed in adults their greatest impact occurs in children . the primary purposes of our study were to establish the utility of testing for hmpv in children who were admitted to our hospital during the respiratory virus season and to compare the impact of hmpv and rsv on the healthcare system . because the primary goal of our study was to compare patients with hmpv to those with rsv and because the number of patients with isolated viruses other than hmpv or rsv was low cases with viruses other than hmpv or rsv and those with no specific virus isolated were combined as a separate group for the additional analyses detailed in the following section . in our study the majority of hmpv positive patients were aged 1324 months n7 43.8 whereas most rsv positive patients n35 71.4 were younger than 12 months of age p0.01 . we found that hmpv positive patients were more likely to be diagnosed with pneumonia 37.5 than were the other two groups 14 p0.04 for rsv positive p0.02 for negative for both hmpv and rsv . in addition hmpv positive patients were equally likely to be diagnosed with bronchiolitis as were rsv positive children approximately 30 but less likely than children with respiratory symptoms who were negative for hmpv and rsv 11 p0.02 . hmpv positive patients were more likely to be treated with antibiotics than were rsv positive patients 81.2 vs. 51.0 p0.03 and were more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit icu 37.5 vs. 12.2 p0.02 . hmpv positive patients were as likely to require oxygen supplementation mechanical ventilation and steroid use as were rsv positive patients table 2 . infections with hmpv and rsv have been reported to be clinically indistinguishable but subtle differences were identified in our study . our results confirm the previous findings that children with symptomatic hmpv infection are older than those infected with rsv possibly because of differences in the upper respiratory tract or lung anatomy of older children that allow for hmpv acquisition . the present study demonstrates as previously reported that hmpv positive patients were as likely to be severely ill as were rsv positive patients . in fact in our study hmpv positive patients were more likely than rsv positive patients to be admitted to the icu even though they were not more likely to have an underlying medical illness . this study however shows that there may be subtle differences in the clinical features of hmpv and rsv infections . our study confirms that hmpv is a significant pathogen particularly in young children and is frequently associated with respiratory symptoms resulting in hospitalization . in general the clinical manifestations of hmpv and rsv associated infections in children are similar although our data suggest subtle differences in illness presentation but not in severity .", " notably a growing number of long ncrnas lncrnas which are considered to be 200 nt in length and are often multiexonic 7 have been implicated in disease etiology 810 . it is therefore of great importance to collect lncrna information and store this information in a one stop knowledge gateway for lncrnas the noncode database . the development of high throughput sequencing methodologies has reduced the cost of rna sequencing and as a result there has been an explosive rise in the number of newly identified lncrnas . after the removal of false and redundant lncrnas noncode contains a total of 527336 transcripts . in addition to the identification of new lncrnas data on the genetics and biochemical properties of lncrnas has accumulated rapidly . along with the ever increasing

1110 lncrnas which were related to 284 diseases . the counterpart of each lncrna was computed using the ucsc liftover tool 40 . after our analysis the single molecule lncrna transcripts were included into noncode .", " to address this concern several strategies have been developed for the site specific modification of proteins ranging from total chemical synthesis usually via native chemical ligation ncl to the genetic incorporation of unnatural amino acids or bio orthogonal functional groups . in between these two extremes the most widely used protein semisynthesis technique is an extension of ncl termed expressed protein ligation epl in which a recombinant protein thioester building block is ligated to a synthetic molecule equipped with a 12aminothiol moiety most commonly an n terminal cys containing peptide through the formation of a native peptide bond scheme 1 . one of the basic requirements of epl is a thioester group at the c terminus of a recombinant protein . by using appropriate intein mutants it is possible to intercept these intermediates with exogenous thiols resulting in an n extein of choice being cleaved from the mutant intein as a reactive thioester derivative suitable for chemical ligation . despite the many successes of epl the approach often suffers from low overall efficiency due to complications associated with the generation of protein thioesters . in particular fusions to inteins are to varying extents susceptible to premature extein cleavage both in vivo and during initial purification from cell lysates which reduces the isolated yield of the intein fusion needed for the subsequent thiolysis step . importantly the cleaved extein side product is unreactive toward epl and its separation from the desired thioester or the ligation product is often difficult for large proteins such as antibodies . a schematic of the procedure for the isolation of an thioester derivative of a protein of interest poi using engineered split intein fragments int and int . to overcome the various drawbacks associated with the intein thiolysis process central to epl we envisioned an alternative strategy based on naturally occurring split inteins . as part of a traceless protein purification system in this case using an artificially split intein pair . given the unique properties of split inteins in particular the ultrafast split dnae inteins we conceived the integrated protein modification system shown in figure 1 in which the split intein association is employed both to purify the desired protein from complex biological mixtures and to trigger the generation of a desired protein thioester for epl . preliminary studies showed that mixing n extein npu fusions where n extein corresponded to various model proteins with the mutant npu npuaa led to highly efficient n extein thioester formation in a thiol dependent manner figures s3 and s4 . encouraged by these results we adapted the system for the one pot purification and generation of c terminally modified proteins by taking full advantage of the strong and specific interaction between the split intein fragments . in each case cells were lysed and the soluble fraction was loaded onto the int column to allow binding of the npu tagged protein to the immobilized npuaa . in all three cases the desired thioester protein eluted from the int column with high recovery 7595 and high purity 95 as determined by rp hplc and mass spectrometry figure 2 . the utility of the thioester derivatives of ub mbp and phpt1 obtained from the column was demonstrated by ligating each of them to an n terminal cys containing fluorescent peptide cgkfl to give the corresponding semisynthetic products in excellent yield figure s10 . importantly one pot thiolysis ligation reactions could be carried out which allowed us to obtain a site specifically modified protein directly from cell lysates without isolating the intermediate thioester figure 3 . ub npu from e. coli cell lysates was bound to the int column as shown in figure 2 and after removal of contaminants through extensive washes intein cleavage and ligation were triggered by addition of 200 mm mes and 1 mm cgkfl peptide . an attractive feature of epl is that it can allow for the preparation of site specifically modified proteins in a virtually traceless manner . this is contingent on the ability to efficiently generate recombinant protein thioesters when any of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids are present at the c terminus of the protein . we first confirmed that the model protein ub npu could bind the int column in the presence of 2 and 4 m urea and that the corresponding ub thioester could be generated with similar yields as obtained under native conditions figure s14 . importantly the hh2b1116mes thioester obtained from the int column could be directly used in epl reactions without further purification . accordingly we designed a construct in which npu was fused to the c terminus of the heavy chain of the antibody dec205npu . based on this the dec205ava fusion was chosen and purified over the int column in an analogous manner to that of the soluble proteins described above figure 6b . elutions from the column contained the thiolyzed dec205 which was subsequently ligated to the cgkfl peptide figure 6c . purification of a monoclonal antibody thioester using a split intein and its site specific modification . we have shown that split dnae inteins can be engineered for the efficient generation and isolation of protein thioesters . furthermore the strategy can be seamlessly integrated with epl and one pot purification ligations can be performed without isolation of the thioester intermediates . the strong and specific interaction between the two intein fragments facilitates the purification of protein thioesters under a variety of conditions including strong denaturants and the isolation of these products directly from cell lysates proceeds significantly faster than via many mainstream epl strategies which often take multiple days and several intermediate enrichment purification steps . thus streamlined epl via our split dnae intein column should provide an efficient route to site specifically modified proteins for basic biochemical research as well as translational applications .", " an analysis of dental casts revealed a class i malocclusion characterized by a 3 mm overjet 3

nezhat et al and they concluded that the cervical stump could be removed laparoscopically by an experienced surgeon . the advantages of the laparoscopic approach included possible stump adhesiolysis providing adequate postoperative vault support and assessment of the pelvic lymph nodes . an initial diagnosis of abnormal pap smear was entertained and the patient opted for a laparoscopic trachelectomy with the option of a laparotomy after discussing all her options . the cervical stump after laparoscopic trachelectomy at one week of follow up the patient was well . they concluded that although laparoscopic hysterectomy for benign diseases was a satisfactory procedure special attention should be paid to careful management of the cervical stump .", " although glycosphingolipids gsls were originally thought to be structural components of plasma membranes several experiments suggested that gsls are involved in the regulation of numerous cellular functions . gsls are expressed on the surface of cellular membranes . there is a general consensus on the roles played by the ceramide moiety of gsls in promoting the formation and stabilization of membrane lipid domains . in addition ceramide was also shown to be involved in gsl mediated functions and several biological activities 3 4 . we recently showed that very long fatty acid chains of ceramide such as c240 and c241 are responsible for the direct connection between lactosylceramide laccer cdw17 and palmitoylated signal transducer molecules . this review describes the role of the fatty acid chains of ceramide in gsl mediated outside in signaling in promoting gsl enriched domain mediated cellular functions as well as the activities of s1p in inflammatory reactions of keratinocytes in human . the most studied gsl enriched domains are membrane lipid microdomains called lipid rafts defined by their gsl and cholesterol rich nature enrichment in gpi anchored proteins and membrane anchored signaling molecules and cytoskeletal association 7 8 . the gsl enriched microdomains on plasma membranes have a diameter of 50100 nm and include signal transducer molecules such as src family kinases 11 12 . these interactions result in the separation of gsl and cholesterol enriched lipid microdomains from other phospholipids in the cell membrane and the formation of distinct domains . electron microscopy using labeled anti gsl antibodies has revealed gsl clusters on the surface of glycosphingolipid phosphatidylcholine pc liposomes even in the absence of sphingomyelin sm and cholesterol . laccer enriched microdomains are composed of laccer sm phospholipids and cholesterol . surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that reduction of the laccer content in the dopc cholesterol laccer sm lipid layer markedly decreased huly m13 but not t5a7 binding to laccer suggesting that the content of laccer in laccer enriched microdomains affects the binding avidity of huly m13 to laccer . these findings suggest that the specificities of these antibodies against the same gsls are dependent on the organizations of the gsls and molecules surrounding the gsl enriched domains . over the last 30 years many studies have indicated that gsls expressed on the cell surface may act as binding sites for microorganisms . gsls have been reported to interact with membrane proteins and modulate the properties of these proteins 2 25 . in addition certain proteins including glycosylphosphatidylinositol gpi anchored and palmitoylated proteins tend to enter gsl enriched membrane microdomains . however the mechanism by which gsls interact with proteins and mediate outside in signaling is unclear . although gsl enriched microdomains have been implicated in a number of important membrane events 2 38 39 the molecular mechanisms responsible for gsl mediated cell functions are still unclear . one of the main issues centers around the association of gsls with signal transducer molecules localized on the cytosolic side . lipidomics analysis revealed that laccer in the neutrophil plasma membrane was mainly composed of molecular species containing c160 c241 and c240 fatty acid chains whereas over 70 of laccer in the plasma membranes of d hl60 cells contained c160 fatty acid chains but only about 14 were c241 and c240 . gpi anchored proteins are composed of glycerol phospholipids which do not have c24 fatty acid chains suggesting that gpi anchored proteins are not able to form large clusters by themselves and can not directly connect with signal transduction molecules through fatty acid chains . to mediate cell functions gpi anchored proteins require signal transduction molecule coupled transmembrane proteins or gsl enriched domains such as laccer enriched domains . however the physiological roles of gsl enriched microdomains are largely undetermined although much is known about the organization and functions of laccer enriched microdomains 24 89 90 . therefore elucidation of their organization and structural specificities based on interactions between gsls and surrounding molecules are important for understanding the physiological functions of gls enriched microdomains and their related diseases .", " in previous work we have utilised anion templation to construct a range of rotaxanes and catenanes which upon removal of the template bind anions strongly and selectively in competitive solvent mixtures . herein we report the preparation of the first anion templated rotaxane incorporating an optically and electro active osmiumii trisbipyridine reporter group . after removal of the anion template selective anion binding is investigated by monitoring the optical and electronic output from the osmiumii trisbipyridine reporter moiety . to develop and fabricate a prototype molecular sensory system surface association removes complications associated with brownian motion typically increases conformational rigidity and will underpin potential applications of such molecular architectures and ultimately device integration.1b to date only a limited number of surface bound interlocked structures have been reported.5b c 7 hence we additionally

features the incorporation of the osmiumii trisbipyridine reporter group into the macrocyclic component of a rotaxane molecular framework containing a convergent hydrogen bond donor anion binding interlocked cavity . the macrocycle contains the 44bisamide22bipyridyl motif for coordination to the osmiumii metal centre and electron rich hydroquinone units to facilitate supplementary secondary aromatic donor acceptor interactions with the electron deficient positively charged pyridinium axle.3a the choice of the osmiumii bipyridyl reporter group comes from its established electro and photochemical properties making the system an attractive probe to sense the anion binding event . rotaxane 1 was obtained in two steps by a chloride anion templated clipping reaction between axle3a

size and shape leading to strong binding even in this competitive 30 aqueous solvent mixture . comparing the strength of chloride anion binding for the three rotaxanes the interlocked host 3 containing a rigid biphenyl axle linkage exhibits significantly stronger binding . the relatively more preorganised binding sites of rotaxanes 1 and 3 as compared with the flexible propyl linked axle component present in 2 potentially enhances chloride binding . the binding of chloride anions by macrocycle 4 was also investigated table 1 and figure 3 b . these observations serve to highlight the rotaxanes potency for chloride anion recognition as a consequence of their three dimensional binding cavities being capable of encapsulation of this guest . a titration of rotaxane 1 with tbacl in 973 acetonitrile water showing emission spectra uncorrected for detector sensitivity increasing chloride anion concentration . association constants m determined by luminescence titration of macrocycle 4 and rotaxanes 1 2 and 3 in 973 acetonitrile water with chloride dihydrogen phosphate and acetate anions as tba salts a 99 confidence intervals given in square brackets . a 11 binding model acetate and dihydrogen phosphate as their tba salts were also titrated with rotaxane 1 and the macrocycle 4 for comparison although with the latter phosphate anion binding could not be determined owing to precipitation . the data indicate that the binding of chloride anions with the rotaxanes is two orders of magnitude greater than that with the macrocycle . the chloride anion association constants obtained from luminescence measurements for the three rotaxanes confirm the observations from nmr spectroscopy of strong binding of chloride ions by rotaxane 3 . resolved fundamental electrochemical characteristics of the rotaxane hosts are similar to those of the macrocycle and are reported in the supporting information page 4 . these results are consistent with those presented in table 1 and confirm the selectivity of the three dimensional cavity towards chloride anion binding . furthermore the smaller potential shift observed here upon binding of chloride anions in comparison with that observed of the macrocycle is attributed to the electron withdrawing nature of the positively charged pyridinium motif of the axle component mitigating donation of electron density to the osmium

high levels of plasma 3pufas can decrease the risk of myocardial infarction.8 in terms of stroke low levels of circulating 3pufas in the blood is a risk factor for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.9 a decreased proportion of linoleic acid is also associated with ischemic stroke.10 compared to normal controls stroke patients with moderate to severe intracranial arterial stenosis or occlusion had decreased levels of dha.11 on the other hand a recent meta analysis revealed that the evidence for the beneficial effects of 3pufas is insufficient in adults with peripheral arterial disease associated with poor cardiovascular outcome.12 to date little information is available on the relationship between the composition of fas and prognosis of stroke . therefore we investigated whether

supplementary table 4 . our study revealed that 3pufas especially dha were associated with stroke severity on hospital admission and poor functional outcome even after adjusting for the nihss score which is considered a strong predictive factor for stroke outcome . one previous study in 281 japanese patients with acute ischemic stroke diagnosed within 24 hours of onset showed that the epa arachidonic acid aa ratio dha aa ratio and the epadha aa ratio were independently and negatively associated with early neurological deterioration.24 furthermore a population based study in the u.s.a which included 2692 elderly adults without prevalence of stroke or cardiovascular disease revealed that higher plasma 3polyunsaturated fas epa dha and total 3 fas were associated with lower mortalities.25 overall these previous studies showed that 3pufas especially epa and dha were related to vascular outcome which is in line with our study results . our results demonstrated a relationship between 3pufas and stroke severity on hospital admission and poor functional outcomes in both the large artery atherosclerosis and the small vessel occlusion stroke subtypes . moreover because progressive cerebral atherosclerosis is associated with a poor stroke outcome32 our finding relative to the association between 3pufas and stroke prognosis may be valid . furthermore because stroke severity on admission correlated with both lower proportion of 3pufas and functional outcome at 3 months there could be a bias due to the interaction between severity on admission and 3pufas . our results demonstrate that 3pufa levels correlate with stroke severity at admission and functional outcomes at 3 months . comparison of proportions of 3pufas according to stroke subtypes the

mandibular growth . although skieller s four variables accounted for 86 of the variability of changes in the direction of mandibular growth mandibular inclination intermolar angle shape of the inferior border of the mandible and inclination of the symphysis however it accounted for only 8 in lee s study . in his study the morphology of the symphysis was found to be associated with the direction of mandibular growth . a mandible with an anterior growth direction was associated with a small height large depth small ratio and large angle of the symphysis . wylie s analysis was also used for assessing sagittal growth pattern of mandible which included mandibular length and lower mandibular length . mean and standard deviation of mandibular parameters of sagittal and vertical analysis table 2 lists the height and depth of the symphysis based on sex and growth pattern in study groups . mean and standard deviation of symphyseal height and depth in the normal group and four subgroups based on gender comparison of each case group with the normal group showed only statistically significant difference between it and the cl iii horizontal and cl ii vertical groups in depth p 0.001 and no significant difference relevant to sex . mean and standard deviation of symphyseal height and depth in the normal group and four subgroups based on gender comparison of each case group with the normal group showed only statistically significant difference between it and the cl iii horizontal and cl ii vertical groups in depth p 0.001 and no significant difference relevant to sex . it was noticed that with horizontal growth patterns of the mandible whether in cl ii or cl iii the symphyseal ratio was higher than in the normal group . did a study to determine whether symphysis morphology could be used as a predictor of the direction of mandibular growth and to assess growth changes of the symphysis . they determined the direction of mandibular growth based on vertical parameters and divided it into anterior and posterior growth patterns . symphysis morphology was found to be associated with the direction of mandibular growth especially in male subjects with symphysis ratio having the strongest relationship in adults . a mandible with an anterior growth direction was associated with a small height large depth small ratio and large angle of the symphysis . it seems that based on both studies the symphysis morphology is different in various vertical growth patterns of the mandible . also symphyseal depth differed significantly in vertical and horizontal growth patterns in comparison to normal groups and symphysis ratio height depth was strongly related to the vertical pattern of mandibular growth in both genders .", "established in 2003 erste

in their fourth year of study at x university who were recruited through a purposeful sampling method . each interview began with the open question apart from the theoretical and practical knowledge you gained during four years of nursing study what other changes do you think you have experienced during your study answers were explored more deeply with relevant probing statements or questions such as please tell me more about that how did that make you feel please describe an actual experience you have had that will help me understand what it meant to you . based on students experiences 5 categories were extracted personal maturity and emotional growth social development closeness to god alterations in value systems and ethical and professional commitments table 1 . students achievements of informal learning during nursing study this category consisted of 2 subcategories personal maturity consisting of self awareness and self discovery accelerated mental maturity and more open mindedness and emotional growth consisting of greater patience appreciation kindness and compassion and altruism . the participants viewed their 4 years in nursing school as an opportunity for gaining a deeper self awareness and self knowledge . they believed that the duties of nursing practice such as frequent personal interactions and development of relationships have great influence on deep reflection about humanity as well as their personal beliefs . the frequent exposure to life and death situations in nursing helped promote maturity . one participant said this maturity has been partly influenced by interactions with professional instructors and encounters with classmates as well as senior students i improved little by little through experiencing critical situations seeing the darker side of life the troubles and pains of other people all of which i was unaware of in my previous relaxed lifestyle . with respect to the principles of fundamental nursing classes they learned to focus on a patient as a human being regardless of nationality ethnicity religious beliefs or financial or sociocultural status . they said seeing patients suffer made them realize the

study one of the most important categories was personal growth which included self awareness self knowledge and self discovery due to frequent interactions with patients and other people and reflection on the experiences of these relationships . participants in the previous study also experienced nurse patient interactions that resulted in self awareness . the participants who increased self awareness did so through reflection and found meaning in being a nurse . chiu the outcome of university courses are not limited to professional development they also promoted the personal growth of nurses . in the present study participants described nursing as an opportunity to gain empathy and other humanistic feelings . wilson stated that nursing students develop emotional competence by critical reflection through classroom sessions and clinical experiences . the participants in the present study also emphasized improvement in interpersonal and communication skills as a result of their nursing studies . they believed that nursing taught them to put themselves in the patient s place and see through their eyes which increased the awareness of patients feelings perceptions and needs . another aspect of nursing training that affected students in this study was their relationship with god . since universities are expected to help students achieve a broader perspective nursing education should help promote student receptivity of human values compatible with their professional mission . indicated that empathizing with patients and caring about their feelings initiates an ethical reflection process in nursing students that may eventually lead to the development of a set of personal values . additionally le duc and kotzer found that even novice nurses can hold professional values indicating that nursing education can initiate a sense of professional commitment in students . the nursing discipline needs to incorporate this type of curriculum to improve nursing student s personal development . during their education this aspect of nursing was reported by paterson and zedrad 2007 in their humanistic nursing theory . the findings of this study revealed that nursing education especially clinical training with its patient student interactions provides an excellent opportunity for student personal growth that is less likely in other majors . through their studies nursing students do not gain expertise in theoretical and technical matters alone but also fulfill their potential as a whole person . nursing education can prepare students to deliver holistic care only if they consider all aspects of the students as humans . the ability to provide holistic care of patients requires treating each nursing student as a whole person through both formal and informal education . therefore recognizing and encouraging covert aspects of nursing education as well as overt ones provide more opportunities for student development not only in cognitive and technical domains but also in affective ones . this can help bring nursing education closer to the ideal of comprehensiveness that enables nurses to care holistically for patients .", "  the in vitro ageing of human diploid fibroblasts hdfs first described by hayflick and moorhead has become a classical experimental model to study cellular ageing . cells with less than 10 passages were considered young cells with high proliferative ability while cultures at 1020 passages have entered an intermediate state or pre senescence and cultures of over 25 passages with no detectable doubling in cell numbers for 2 weeks were considered as senescent cells . besides oxidative dna damage accumulation telomere shortening has been widely considered as another important mechanism to trigger replicative senescence in human fibroblasts . a comparison of the telomere shortening rates in different hdfs under different conditions revealed that the ratio between oxidative damage and antioxidative defence was quantitatively the most important determinant of telomere shortening . in view of this this study was designed to evaluate the molecular mechanism of tocotrienol rich fraction in possibly modulating different stages of cellular ageing in hdfs by determining the changes in molecular markers of cell ageing sagal dna damage telomere shortening and cell cycle progression in young presenescent and senescent hdfs . figure 1 shows the percentage of viable fibroblast cells after incubated with trf at various concentrations 0.10.5 mg ml for 24 h. the percentage of viable cells was significantly increased p .05 with trf treatment at 0.5 mg ml figure 1a for young hdfs . for presenescent hdfs the percentage of viable cells was significantly increased p .05 with trf incubation at concentrations of 0.3 mg ml 0.4 mg ml and 0.5 mg ml figure 1b while the percentage of viable cells for senescent hdfs was significantly increased p .05 with trf treatment at all concentrations figure 1c . quantitative analysis showed the percentage of cells positive for sagal staining was increased p .05 in senescent cells compared to young and presenescent hdfs . damaged dna was higher in senescent hdfs compared to young and presenescent cells p .05 which was decreased with trf treatment p cell cycle progression analysis showed that the cell population in the s phase was lower p .05 in senescent hdfs compared to young hdfs . treatment with trf significantly increased p .05 cells in the s phase and g2m phase for all stages of cellular senescence of hdfs . similar trf treatment had no effect on telomere length in young hdfs figure 7b . figure 7c shows the representative pcr analysis for telomerase activity of hdfs at various passages with trf treatment . treatment with trf significantly increased the telomerase activity in senescent hdfs p .05 whereby no effects was observed in young hdfs figure 7d . the present study evaluated the effects of tocotrienol rich fraction trf in possibly modulating cellular ageing in hdfs . our results showed that when hdfs reached senescence there were clear changes in cell morphology decreased cell proliferation and increased senescence associated galactosidase activity . the increased sagal positive cells which was observed with senescence of hdfs can be attributed to increased in lysosomal content . increase in sagal activity in senescent hdfs and stress induced premature senescence sips is an irreversible process upon subculture suggesting that cellular ageing results in irreversible nonmitotic growth . however incubation with trf was shown to decrease the percentage of cells positive for sagal suggesting a reversal of cellular ageing of hdfs . the percentage of viable cells was highest at the maximum concentration studied that is 0.5 mg ml indicating trf promoted cells propagation and viability in all stages of cellular ageing of hdfs . oxidative stress caused damage to dna which increased significantly in senescent cells especially in postmitotic tissues and the levels correlated with ageing and age related diseases . comparison of damaged dna in different treatment groups of hdfs in the present study showed that total dna damage was significantly increased in senescent cells while less damaged dna was observed in young and presenescent hdfs . similarly our data showed significant decreased in s phase cells and increased in damaged dna in senescent hdfs indicating less cell proliferation and greater dna damage as cells aged . it is highly probable that protection against dna damage with trf treatment in senescent hdfs could be attributed to either prevention of oxidative stress induced dna damage or enhancement of dna repair mechanism . our data showed no significant difference in g0g1 or g2m phase with cellular ageing of hdfs while the s phase cells decreased significantly . the decreased and increased cells in g0g1 phase and s phase respectively were observed with trf treatment at various stages of cellular ageing indicating inhibition of growth arrest and enhancement of cell replication . decreased level of total dna damage and increased percentage of cells in s phase in trf treated senescent cells indicated a potential protective role of trf against dna strand breaks and cell cycle arrest . our data in the present study suggested that both telomere shortening and decreased telomerase activity might be the contributing factors in cellular ageing . in such a situation treatment with trf however protected against telomere shortening in senescent hdfs with concomitant increased in telomerase activity . therefore we concluded that tocotrienol rich fraction delays or prevents cellular ageing particularly in senescent hdfs as shown by the elongated telomere length decreased levels of damaged dna and progression of cell cycle to s phase besides increased cell propagation in all stages of cellular ageing of hdfs with trf treatment .", " aging is the main risk factor for a variety of neurodegenerative diseases where specific proteins accumulate as pathological aggregates . recently there has been considerable interest in investigating widespread protein aggregation in the absence of disease . the examination of some of these proteins in vivo reveals their assembly into large the discovery of endogenous age dependent protein aggregation in model organisms gives us the unprecedented opportunity to dissect the intrinsic cellular machineries responsible for preventing protein aggregation without using ectopically expressed human disease associated proteins . an important question is whether the special assembly properties of rbps puts them at risk of aggregating during aging in a multicellular organism and not just in the context of disease . overall it is imperative to know the causes and consequences of wild type rbp aggregation during aging in order to fully understand rbp aggregation in neurodegenerative diseases . in the current study we chose to focus on key rbps responsible for stress granule formation . whether these stress granule proteins are innocent bystanders transiently interacting with tdp43 and fus or whether they co aggregate and accelerate disease associated rbp aggregation remains intensely debated bentmann et al . we show that key stress granule related rbps sgrbps accumulate in aberrant stress granule like puncta and in large solid aggregates in aged c. elegans . we show that sgrbp aggregation is triggered at an earlier age by their co aggregation with other misfolded proteins a process that is prevented by daf16 in daf2 mutants . to identify and quantify changes in aggregation prone proteins in animals with reduced daf2 signaling we performed an in depth proteomic analysis of the insoluble proteome from both control and long lived animals figure 1a table s1 . in three biological replicates we identified 260 insoluble proteins of which 186 were highly prone to aggregate with age in control animals figure 1b . to investigate specifically changes in insolubility regulated by reduced daf2 signaling we sorted proteins prone to aggregate with age in control animals 2fold by their fold change in insolubility with age in the long lived conditions . we restricted our analysis to 87 proteins that aggregated less with age 0.83fold and 52 proteins that continued to aggregate with age 1.2fold in the long lived animals figure 1b table s1 . by western blot we confirmed that reduced daf2 signaling abrogated their aggregation with age figures 1e and s2b . we confirmed that par5 and daf21 continued to aggregate with age in long lived animals by 7fold and 10fold respectively albeit to a reduced extent compared with controls figure s2c . together these results indicate that different types of rna granule components including key rbps responsible for their assembly become insoluble with age and long lived animals with reduced daf2 signaling are highly successful in preventing their aggregation . with age we observed a striking change in the distribution pattern of these key stress granule rbps . whereas the majority of pab1 and tiar2 proteins were diffusely localized in non stressed young animals we found that both stress granule components accumulated in distinct puncta in aged animals figures 2b and 2d figure s4f this change was specific for pab1 and tiar2 as the fluorescent tags alone venus or tagrfp remained diffuse with age figure s4e david et al . remarkably when co expressed pab1 preferentially co localized within tiar2positive age dependent stress granule like puncta figure 2 g suggesting that interactions between rbps change their aggregation patterns . a hallmark of protein aggregation associated with disease is the immobility of proteins within the aggregates . the consequences of age dependent protein aggregation for the animal s health are poorly understood . however this effect is likely due to higher levels of functional pab1 and not related to protein aggregation because pab1 does not aggregate in animals at 15c figure s5a . our proteomic study revealed that reduced daf2 signaling efficiently prevents the insolubility of stress granule components with age . we confirmed that long lived daf2 mutants greatly delay the formation of both stress granule like structures and large aggregates of pab1 and tiar2 figures 5a and 5b figures s6a and s6b . to gain insight into the mechanisms controlling protein aggregation we investigated the role of the transcription factor hsf1 activated by reduced daf2 signaling hsu et al . the same chaperones discovered to regulate stress granule dynamics in other model systems could also play a role in preventing sgrbp aggregation . however overexpression of dnj19 and dnj13 did not significantly reduce pab1 aggregation with age figures s6f and s6i indicating that these chaperones may not modulate sgrbp aggregation . finally we investigated the role of hsp70 on sgrbp aggregation and found that inhibition of hsp70 by rnai did not alter pab1 aggregation table s6 . collectively these results reveal that hsf1 is an important regulator of sgrbp aggregation throughout life and it contributes to maintaining dynamic stress granule proteins in long lived daf2 mutants . in daf2 mutants daf16 protected against pab1 aggregation in aged animals figures 5c and 5d importantly daf2 mutants use daf16 to control different types of age dependent protein aggregation because delayed aggregation of the kinase kin19 was also dependent on daf16 figure 5 g . we speculated that widespread protein misfolding and aggregation occurring with age could promote sgrbp aggregation . conversely kin19 aggregation was slightly impeded by pab1 overexpression figure 6d indicating that sgrbp aggregation does not cross seed kin19 aggregation . these data strongly suggest that pab1 aggregation is not simply the consequence of generalized cellular stress induced by kin19 overexpression . taken together we interpret these findings to imply that the accumulation of misfolded proteins with age acts as a seed for sgrbp aggregation . therefore the overall reduction in widespread protein aggregation in long lived daf2 conditions as evidenced by our proteomic analysis at least in part through increased daf16 activity could be an effective strategy to prevent sgrbp aggregation . the accumulation of other misfolded proteins during age acts as a seed for the aggregation of key sgrbps . significantly one of the main outcomes of the longevity program initiated by reduced daf2 signaling while responding to widespread protein aggregation is the preservation of rbp solubility with age . in this study we have examined in detail the aggregation pattern of pab1 and tiar2 two key rbps with lc prion like domains that are important for the formation of stress granules . during the aging process both proteins spontaneously assembled into small puncta similar to liquid droplets induced during stress and into larger aggregates . because our proteomic analysis revealed a number of stress granule components in the insoluble proteome it is likely that secondary stress granule proteins are also incorporated . in support of a gain of function related to sgrbp aggregation two rare diseases are caused by mutated pabpn1 and tia1 the human homologs of pab1 and tiar2 which accumulate in pathological aggregates brais et al . apart from accelerating pathology indirectly by reducing cellular health the presence of stress granule proteins in pathological protein aggregates is emerging as a common denominator in different types of neurodegenerative diseases including als ftld alzheimer s disease and huntington s disease aulas and vande velde 2015 bentmann et al . the inherent aggregation propensity of stress granule proteins demonstrates that they are unlikely to be transient interacting partners in pathological aggregates . it remains to be determined whether age related sgrbp aggregation acts as a seed for disease associated protein aggregation . interestingly recent cell culture data show that the assembly of stress granules caused by disease associated protein aggregation in turn promotes pathological aggregation vanderweyde et al . the age dependent aggregation of sgrbps and prevalence of stress granule components in neurodegenerative diseases underline their relevance as therapeutic targets . in the case of reduced daf2 signaling sgrbp aggregation is suppressed by at least two mechanisms daf16 activation prevents cross seeding by delaying the accumulation of misfolded aggregation prone proteins and increased activity of hsf1 during development assures enhanced sgrbp proteostasis throughout adulthood . overall both of these strategies used to restore the dynamic nature of stress granule proteins could also directly prevent disease associated rbp aggregation .", " secondary

body mass index bmi duration of t2 dm glycemic control dyslipidemia systolic blood pressure sbp estimated glomerular filtration rate egfr uric acid and albuminuria are associated with increased arterial stiffness in patients with t2 dm 1 4 6 . however life style related problems were not fully taken into consideration in these studies although the risk of cvd in patients with t2 dm correlates with numerous lifestyle problems 7 8 . in fact we recently demonstrated that poor sleep quality in patients with t2 dm correlates with increased arterial stiffness however in that study we did not take conventional cardiovascular risk factors into full consideration . the aim of the present study was to identify lifestyle habits that are associated with bapwv in t2 dm patients free of apparent cvd using a model adjusted for numerous conventional cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle habits . the inclusion criteria were as follows 1 male and female t2 dm patients 2 age 25 and 70

. furthermore we found that poor sleep quality was associated with arterial stiffness even after adjustment for several conventional cardiovascular risk factors and other lifestyle habits . although the study design does not allow evaluation of causal relations the above data suggest that poor sleep quality may be an important target of interventions that can prevent arterial stiffness in patients with t2 dm . in contrast our data failed to show close association of other lifestyle problems such as energy intake physical activity morningness eveningness sleep duration and depressive state with arterial stiffness in patients with t2 dm . while previous reports demonstrated that bmi was positively associated with arterial stiffness 5 20 24 25 bmi was inversely associated with arterial stiffness in this study consistent with a previous report in non t2 dm patients . a close association between serum uric acid and arterial stiffness in male patients with newly diagnosed t2

reliability might mean for health care by analyzing what is known about how highly reliable organizations function . hros recognize that despite all their best efforts and past safety successes errors will occur and safety will be threatened . how close or far away is the typical hospital today from this state of high reliability we rarely observe the five principles of high reliability guiding the actions of organizations their leaders and caregivers . in health care the rarity of adverse events like these tends to reinforce organizations beliefs that they will never experience them and leads to a misplaced confidence that their safety systems are adequate . one of the most pervasive safety problems in hospitals relates to their failure to be sensitive to operations . health care workers at all levels routinely observe unsafe conditions behaviors and practices but they very often fail to bring those problems to the attention of managers who are placed appropriately in the daily work flow to address the problems quickly . a specific example helps illuminate the complexities of the barriers that hospitals face in trying to be sensitive to these safety signals . in its 2012 report of the results of its annual patient safety culture survey the federal agency for healthcare research and quality stated that on average 65 percent of respondents from 1128 hospitals worried that mistakes they had made were kept in their personnel files and 50 percent agreed that staff felt that their mistakes were held against them agency for healthcare research and quality 2012 . thus available data and considerable experience suggest strongly that the five principles of high reliability would be unrecognizable in an average hospital s daily work . to the contrary in several instances particularly those involving the rapid identification and management of errors and unsafe conditions it appears that today s hospitals often exhibit the very opposite of high reliability . there is an important corollary to the observation that hospitals are currently characterized by low reliability . we must take careful note of how hospitals function today in all the key arenas that must change if high reliability is to become possible for them . this possibility will become more real if we can accurately describe hospitals current state and chart a plausible and feasible pathway toward high reliability one that defines specific milestones representing incremental progress . these thoughtful contributions help focus us on what hospitals should be doing to become highly reliable . as noted earlier we described elsewhere a broad conceptual framework for adapting high reliability science to health care organizations chassin and loeb 2011 . this framework was derived from the integration of high reliability science our considerable experience working with the thousands of health care organizations that the joint commission accredits or certifies and some studies explaining how some hospitals have started to adapt high reliability principles to their operations dixon and shofer 2006 fei and vlasses 2008 frankel leonard and denham 2006 may 2013 wolterman and shabot 2012 . we explored three major changes that health care organizations would have to undertake in order to make substantial progress toward high reliability 1 the leadership s commitment to the ultimate goal of zero patient harm 2 the incorporation of all the principles and practices of a safety culture throughout the organization and 3 the widespread adoption and deployment of the most effective process improvement tools and methods . since 2009 the joint commission has required the leadership of all health care organizations that it accredits to create and maintain a culture of safety consequently many hospitals now conduct staff surveys to assess their safety culture agency for healthcare research and quality 2012 sexton et al . few however have moved beyond tabulating survey results to taking effective actions that have resulted in creating the kind of safety culture that supports high reliability . we believe that three sets of process improvement tools lean six sigma and change management constitute the most effective way for health care to dramatically enhance its capacity to create nearly perfect safety processes dellifraine langabeer and nembhard 2010 dupree et al . by their careful attention to unraveling the complexities of health care quality and safety problems the tools of robust process improvement offer health care the means to implement the reluctance to simplify principle of high reliability . since 2009 the joint commission s center for transforming healthcare has been applying these rpi tools together with teams from hospitals around the country that also have mastered their use to address a number of health care s most persistent quality and safety problems . having established these three major domains of change we then considered how hospitals and health systems operate today and how they might evolve slowly or rapidly toward high reliability in each of these three areas . we observed hospitals or health systems in which a few or several of these components currently reside in each of these four stages of high reliability . a team at the joint commission has been engaged with high reliability experts from academia and industry since 2010 to assimilate what is known about hros with the institutional knowledge we have gained from our work in health care quality and safety . to produce the first draft of the framework we combined the information gleaned from these experiences with the empirical literature on the characteristics of hospitals associated with improved safety and quality . leadership and high reliability stages of organizational maturity in addition physicians are essential to the success of any quality initiative in hospitals . in order to move effectively toward high reliability physicians must routinely champion quality improvement initiatives throughout the hospital . the system s ceo pointed out ensuring patient safety is our core value and it s our only core value wolterman and shabot 2012 . a hospital approaching high reliability adopts health it solutions in a coordinated and integrated manner following the principles of safe adoption joint commission 2008b karsh 2004 . a culture of safety that fully supports high reliability has three central attributes trust report and improve reason and hobbs 2003 . when all three of these components of a safety culture trust report and improve are working well they reinforce one another and produce a stable organizational culture that sustains high reliability . safety culture and high reliability stages of organizational maturity maintaining trust also requires the organization to hold employees accountable for adhering to safety protocols and procedures . hospitals that move toward high reliability establish codes of behavior that are modeled by leaders including nurses and physicians who champion efforts to eliminate intimidation and encourage and reward the reporting of blameless errors and unsafe conditions . furthermore as opposed to today s norm of focusing on single events hospitals should compile the results of their investigations across many harm events and close calls to identify which of their safety systems or defenses are most in need of improvement . as hospitals make more progress toward high reliability they will include safety culture metrics as part of their strategic planning programs set goals for improving on those metrics and report on those metrics to their boards just as they report on metrics related to financial performance or patient satisfaction . hospitals need new process improvement tools and methods to break out of their current state of low reliability . we have argued that robust process improvement rpia combination of lean six sigma and change management is a much more potent set of tools than health care currently uses to address safety and quality problems . for hros quality and safety are the personal responsibility of every employee and being armed with highly effective ways to solve complex problems gives employees some of what they need to exercise that responsibility . robust process improvement and high reliability stages of organizational maturity today s hospitals generally lag far behind this ideal state . enabling hospitals to use this high reliability health care framework requires additional work . to advance toward high reliability hospitals must be able to assess their current state of maturity with respect to each of the framework s fourteen components and then to access proven strategies tools and methods to advance to more mature levels . the utility of the assessment to hospitals in identifying their most pressing opportunities for making progress toward high reliability and the availability of specific tools to facilitate such progress is currently being field tested . many health care leaders are reluctant to commit to the goal of high reliability because they regard it as unrealistic or unachievable or a distraction from their current serious fiscal and regulatory pressures . finally hospitals and systems like memorial hermann and cincinnati children s that have been trailblazers in striving for high reliability health care have developed their own strategies and tools largely through trial and error . for this movement to broaden and deepen the next wave of hospitals and health systems will need proven tools and methods to speed their journey through higher levels of maturity . leadership and high reliability stages of organizational maturity in addition physicians are essential to the success of any quality initiative in hospitals . in order to move effectively toward high reliability both the formally appointed leaders chief medical officer vice president for medical affairs and the informal leaders medical staff president voluntary medical staff leaders need to be visible and active enthusiasts for quality including physician leaders who are not employees of the hospital . the system s ceo pointed out ensuring patient safety is our core value and it s our only core value wolterman and shabot 2012 . a hospital approaching high reliability

to assess its effectiveness in facilitating hospitals advancement toward high reliability .", " acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis agep is a rare acute reaction that is drug induced in 90 of the cases characterized by a widespread sterile pustular rash . agep is a disease characterized by the rapid onset of many sterile nonfollicular pustules usually arising on an edematous erythema and frequently accompanied by leukocytosis and fever . the main differential diagnosis of agep is pustular psoriasis . because the pustules clinically and histologically resemble the lesions of pustular psoriasis and because in a number of reports patients had a history of plaque psoriasis some authors assume that agep is nothing more than an acute exacerbation of psoriasis caused by a variety of exogenous triggers however many studies strongly suggest that agep is not associated with psoriasis 1 5 . in this group the present case of agep has well defined criteria and because correct diagnosis generally leads to spontaneous resolution once the causative drug is withdrawn clinicians should keep the possibility of this cutaneous drug reaction in mind .", " according to international results

among paediatric patients were slightly better but without statistically significant differences with the results recorded in the intermediate group patients . in the paediatric group of our cohort there was a minority of patients about 5 that despite the treatment showed a worsening trend or at least an instability of keratoconus . pilot study demonstrated the effective ability of corneal cross linking to retard keratoconus progression in all age groups with better functional response in patients under 26 years . according to our long term comparative age related analysis and results the

administration fda in 2004 for the treatment of lennox gastaut syndrome lgs in patients aged 4 years and older.2 ruf was authorized for the same indication in europe in january 2007.23 the mechanism of action involves limiting the firing of excessive sodium dependent action potentials.1 ruf has been reported to reduce the number of drop attacks and major motor seizure in about 60 of patients with lgs and has subsequently been regarded as an effective adjunctive therapeutic agent.2 in recent years studies have been reported that ruf is also efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of various epilepsy syndromes other than lgs including cases of refractory epilepsy in pediatric patients.3 however there are still limited data regarding the long term treatment results of ruf for pediatric refractory epilepsy . the aim of this study was to delineate the long term efficacy and tolerability of ruf in children and infants with intractable epilepsies . we performed a retrospective study for the patients who met the following inclusion criteria 1 who were followed up for more than one year at samsung medical center since the beginning of the ruf use at the time of 31 aug 2011 2 who were less than 19 years of age at the time of the start of ruf treatment 3 who were classified as intractable epilepsy meaning presence of persistent seizures despite the use of more than three antiepileptic drugs and 4 whose data on the clinical characteristics and seizure outcome were available . we conformed to the classification of the international league against epilepsy ilae in 1981 and 1989 in classifying the seizure and epilepsy of the patients.45 the efficacy of ruf was evaluated by the response rate by comparing the seizure frequencies at the baseline and in the last three months . ruf has established its efficacy in lgs and has been approved as an adjunctive treatment for patients older than four years of age with lgs.6 in previous studies ruf was also efficacious and well tolerated in treatment of various epilepsy syndromes other than lgs including cases of refractory epilepsy in pediatric patients.3 however the data about the efficacy of ruf in epilepsies other than lgs are limited.37 in this study ruf showed a response rate of 21.6 in patients with lgs intractable ge or lre . the response rate of ruf in patients with refractory epilepsies including lgs was reported to be 26.746.7.1378 those studies included both child and adult patients and the mean age ranged from 1 to 50 years . according to the study of kluger et al7 which was conducted in 60 patients 45 children and 15 adults treated with ruf over the mean period of 14.5 months with inadequately controlled epilepsy syndromes range 318 months the overall response rate was 26.7 . in another study the patients with refractory epilepsies showed the response rate of 46 at 21 weeks of ruf therapy.8 this study included pediatric patients with lgs or other intractable epilepsy and the mean age of the patients was 9.5 years in the range of 120 years . in one prospective study with 43 patients with lgs the overall response rate of ruf at 12 months was 60.5 without worsening of seizures.2 in another study involving children and young adults with lgs the response rate was 54.8.3 in those studies patients with lgs took a large part of the total number of patients compared to our study group . according to previous data atonic seizure and tonic seizure were the most improved types of seizure by ruf as adjunctive therapy 63.6 and 48.6 respectively.19 also in a long term open label extension study 124 patients with lgs aged 437 years were treated with ruf for a median of 432 days . during the treatment 47.9 of patients had 50 reduction in the frequency of tonic atonic seizures.6 based on previous studies ruf appeared to be an effective adjunctive therapy for intractable atonic seizures . in our study partial seizure responded equally to ruf and a similar result was reported in other studies.37 retention rate is known as an indicator for evaluating both efficacy and adverse effects.10 according to one previous study the retention rate of ruf at 14.5 months was 41.77 which is consistent with the present study . children with lgs and other intractable epilepsy syndromes showed 21.6 response rate and 54 retention rate during ruf treatment . the present data suggest that ruf provides good efficacy and tolerability in pediatric patients with refractory generalized or localization related epilepsy syndromes as well as lgs .", " interestingly most of the cited studies analyzed the cataract prevalence in age groups which are substantially different from those of our two cases . here we report two cases that both developed cataract before the age of 50 years on the side affected from the cluster headache and reviewed published similar cases and potential mechanisms for comorbidity . references were identified by searches of pubmed from 1966 until october 2007 with the terms cluster headache and cataract . therefore to our knowledge this is the first report of cataract occurring in cluster headache patients and interestingly on the same eye affected by the pain attack . it is of interest that both patients developed cataract in a young age after suffering for years from chronic cluster headache attacks and in the absence of main risk factors for the development of early onset cataract including prolonged steroid drugs exposure . however because we could not investigate the pedigree of one patient any hypothetical genetic link between the uncommon occurrence of early onset cataract and cluster headache can not be proposed . thus no speculation can be made on a possible causal relationship between repeated episodes of pain inflammation and autonomic abnormalities that are considered to contribute to the cluster headache attack and the precocious occurrence of the cataract . however this first evidence of the occurrence of cataract in relatively young adult men with a history of chronic cluster headache is of importance because underlining this uncommon type of comorbidity may favour the report of additional similar cases .", " although vcb is one most commonly used adjuvant gynaecological treatments there is a lack of studies analysing whether dosimetric factors are influenced by overweight . our aim therefore was to evaluate the effect of bmi and perivaginal fat on dose in organs at risk during fractionated vcb . we considered fat that was confined within the 100 isodose on the first ct planning scan as the perivaginal fat . perivaginal fat analysis was performed only in the first ct planning scan because the most common practice for vcb is to perform only one ct and to translate this plan to the next fractions . we considered fat that was confined within the 100 isodose on the first ct planning scan as the perivaginal fat . perivaginal fat analysis was performed only in the first ct planning scan because the most common practice for vcb is to perform only one ct and to translate this plan to the next fractions . the fact that obese patients were treated with larger cylinder applicators 82.4 than patients in the normal range 25 chi square test p0.037 is significant . a positive significant correlation was observed between bmi and perivaginal fat volume r0.556 p0.001 fig . bmi also showed positive correlation with age r0.272 p0.037 and negative correlation with the bladder dvh metrics d0.1cc r0.366 p0.004 d1cc r0.454 p0.001 d2cc r 0.451 p 0.001 a low positive correlation was observed between the perivaginal fat volume and cylinder angle r0.288 p0.027 vaginal cylinders tilted towards the bladder as perivaginal fat volume increased fig . when a reanalysis was performed replacing bmi with perivaginal fat volume models were unable to retain the perivaginal fat volume among the predictors . the main finding from this study is that higher bmi values showed an association with lower bladder dose parameters but not with rectal dose . a reduction in rectal doses among patients with higher bmi during prostate brachytherapy this dose reduction is considered to be a result of the inverse square law due to the increase in fatty tissue at the prostate rectum interface . our results from an analysis of a large sample and a high number of brachytherapy insertions confirm those of a recent study that reported higher bladder doses in women with lower bmi during vcb . a positive significant correlation was observed between bmi and perivaginal fat volume r0.5561 p0.001 fig . our results do not support an increase in perivaginal fat or application of the inverse square law as the main cause of lower doses in oars due to the inability of perivaginal fat to remain in the multivariate regression models . perivaginal fat volume was associated with an anterior cylinder tilt which paradoxically did not go with higher bladder dose therefore we believe that anatomical visceral fat distribution could be the cause of differences in bladder dose according to bmi fig . strong correlation was observed between perivaginal fat volume which was used as a surrogate for visceral fat volume and bmi . in conclusion the results reported in this study demonstrate a significant inverse correlation between bmi and bladder dose deposition during vcb .", " therefore we attempted to determine the incidence of hcc and its precursors in this group of cirrhotic patients through a thorough examination of explanted hbv related cirrhotic livers . among all explanted cirrhotic livers 92 89.3 had df with lcc 57 55.3 of which showed scc as well . out of these 103 explanted livers 39 37.9 had lgdn 38 36.9 had hgdn 19 18.4 had early hepatocellular carcinoma ehcc and 21 20.4 had ahcc figures 3 6 . however among livers with ehcc 6 were not accompanied with ahcc 2 of which were unsuspected before surgery and diagnosed on the explanted liver . therefore studies on the incidence and diagnosis of precancerous lesions of hcc are important especially for patients who develop hcc secondary to hbv infection and cirrhosis . in this study we attempted to identify the true prevalence of hcc and its precursors in 103 explanted livers through thorough sectioning of at least 15 sections for each liver after precise inspection of the gross specimens . according to this result lcc is a common finding in cirrhotic livers of patients with chronic hepatitis b but it does not seem to be associated with any malignant lesion thus confirming the lack of premalignant potential in theses lesions . out of these 57 livers with scc 19 70.4 had ehcc and 21 36.8 had hcc . among the 103 explanted livers 39 37.9 had lgn 38 36.9 had hgdn 19 18.4 had ehcc and 21 20.4 had ahcc . thus 70 and 53 of the cases with lgdn and 50 and 55 of the cases with hgdn showed ehcc and hcc respectively . according to previous studies lgdn and hgdn are indicators of increased risk of hcc in cirrhotic livers . in conclusion scc lgdn and hgdn seem to be common associated findings and precursors of hcc in livers infected with hepatitis b. a strict follow up and a precise and thorough sampling and sectioning of livers with scc and any abnormal dns especially those larger than 1 cm are highly recommended because of their association with malignancy .", " studies have demonstrated their accuracy high sensitivity and specificity.34 the main downside to these instruments is that they require a significant amount of time and involve numerous steps increasing the potential for tear evaporation as such they are not practical especially for dry eye patients with low tear volumes.34 a newer technology produced by tearlab uses a micro electrode to measure the number of charged particles in a tear sample this electrode is designed to avoid direct contact with the ocular surface thereby reducing the chance for reflex tearing.3 the tearlab measurement method appears as accurate as the more involved osmometers differing on average by only 2 mosm l in both normal and dry eye patients.3 the tear lab device requires only a small tear sample 0.2 l and is able to provide results almost instantly reducing the level of tear evaporation.35 when compared with a vapor pressure osmometer the tearlab osmolarity system was able to measure more patients with lower volume tear samples.4 compared to the clifton osmometer the tearlab device was reported to have similar sensitivity but slightly better specificity and positive predictive value.3 the aim of the current review is to establish whether published studies support the use of tear osmolarity testing primarily using the tearlab device as a tool for ded diagnosis and treatment monitoring . comments from the literature related to the role of tear osmolarity in the pathophysiology of ded and how ocular or systemic conditions and pharmaceuticals impact tear osmolarity are also discussed . a more detailed review of the remaining papers related to tear osmolarity tear osmolarity research before the year 2000 was limited in scope methodology and applicability . discussions of tear osmolarity that did not include a diagnostic component were also eliminated while they provide a research basis for the use of osmolarity in evaluating the tear film diagnostic papers are indicative of the clinical application of this more basic research . while not shown in table 3 the results were independent of study quality of the 104 independent studies that were rated 31 32104 had a high or moderate rating and of those 32 articles 72 2332 were positive indicating that tear osmolarity was a useful diagnostic tool in the evaluation of dry eye and its severity . we discuss how tear osmolarity testing is performed the cut off value for dry eye diagnosis the accuracy and repeatability of tear osmolarity testing and how tear osmolarity compares with other commonly used diagnostic tests . finally articles discussing the effect of external factors ocular andor systemic disease and pharmaceuticals on tear osmolarity are reviewed . in the literature tear osmolarity threshold values have varied from 305 mosm l8 to 316 mosm l.5 one reported reason for variability in tear osmolarity threshold values is tear film instability a hallmark characteristic of the disease.910 normal mild moderate and severe dry eyes had average tear osmolarity values of approximately 3028 mosm l 31510 mosm l and 336022 mosm l respectively.1011 another study had lower reported mean values but the study noted that they included more patients with mild and moderate ded than severe ded.8 it can be seen that the distribution of ded severity in different populations may explain some of the variability in threshold values . studies have demonstrated that tear osmolarity is most influenced by and correlated with disease severity.1011 one study found that using a tear osmolarity threshold of 305 mosm l gave a 98.4 positive predictive value.8 using a tear osmolarity threshold of 316 mosm l to 317 mosm l sensitivity varied from 5912 to 8113 specificity varied from 7814 to 9412 with a positive predictive value of 85313 a negative predictive value of 7413 and an overall predictive accuracy of 89.12 a meta analysis that used a 316 mosm l threshold noted that tear osmolarity may be more accurate than lactoplate the schirmer s test and rose bengal testing.12 currently the 316 mosm l threshold is believed to better discriminate between mild and moderate severe dry eye while 308 mosm l is now considered to be a widely accepted threshold.5 a tear osmolarity threshold of 308 mosm l correctly diagnosed severe dry eye and normal patients 90.7 and 81.3 of the time respectively this value appeared to be the most sensitive for discriminating between normal eyes and those presenting with early stages of ded.10 variability in tear osmolarity can also be a diagnostic indicator in one study variability between the two eyes in normal mild or moderate dry eye patients and severe dry eye patients was 6.95.9 mosm l 11.710.9 mosm l and 26.522.7 mosm l respectively.10 variability in inter eye measurements and repeat measurements in the same eye appears to increase with the severity of dry eye . measured osmolarity is low and stable in those without ded.9 tear osmolarity has been shown to have good repeatability8 in normal subjects with no significant difference in osmolarity values when using up to four readings taken 1 to15 minutes apart.9 a concern with using osmolarity as a diagnostic test is the observed overlap in measured values between normal and dry eyes this has been documented as especially high in two studies.1516 however in one of these studies15 dry eye patients were being treated with eye drops or systemic medications which would be expected to lower osmolarity . this categorization may have skewed the results in favor of the tests used in the categorization process.16 different studies have suggested that tear osmolarity does not provide a sharp diagnostic cut off but rather can serve as a guide to indicate disease severity or progression.810 while tear osmolarity testing is beneficial at providing a numerical value to the current state of dry eyes other complementary diagnostic tests are valuable in discriminating the etiology of the disease.10 when compared with schirmer s test results meibomian gland grading ocular surface disease index osdi tear break up time tbut corneal and conjunctival staining tear osmolarity was better at predicting dry eye severity as tear osmolarity increased dry eye severity also increased in a largely linear pattern.811 another study also demonstrated that tear osmolarity had higher sensitivity when compared with corneal staining conjunctival staining and meibomian grading and better specificity when compared with tbut and schirmer s test results.10 the higher the severity of ded the greater the correlation between tear osmolarity and other diagnostic tests8 this result may indicate that other diagnostic tests are less sensitive to mild ded diagnosis . one factor here is that the general correlation between objective tests and subjective tests for dry eye is poor.1 this issue is likely due to the multiple etiologies and presentations of ded when particular tests are specific to one etiology then there may be a lack of overall correlation.1 like other diagnostic signs tear osmolarity may not correlate with symptoms in a general population18 although it has been shown to correlate over time with effective therapy as described in the pharmacological effects and treatment section of the present review . in the same study9 a minority of patients 8 or 225 had increased tear osmolarity and no symptoms or low tear osmolarity and symptoms this result may be due to them having only mild ded in the former case and low osmolarity due to a condition other than ded in the latter case . in a recent 2013 article no change in tear osmolarity or any other dry eye diagnostic test was observed after refractive surgery despite a decrease in corneal sensitivity.26 after cataract surgery tear osmolarity has been noted to increase.27 the difference here may be explained by the subjects ages average age was 26 years in the refractive surgery study26 and 71 years in the cataract surgery study.27 older patients may take longer to recover from surgically induced ocular trauma.27 trabeculectomy surgery performed on a patient population with an average age of 71 years also had higher tear osmolarity than a control group this result was attributed to the presence of the bleb the use of mitomycin c which may cause epithelial damage or the residual effects of long term use of glaucoma medications before surgery.28 no difference in tear osmolarity was noted between the eye that underwent eyelid reconstruction surgery and the un operated eye of the same patient this result may be related with corrective tearing as evidenced by the higher schirmer s test results in the operated eye.29 table 4 shows studies that investigated the effect of various ocular and systemic conditions on tear osmolarity . different ocular conditions also seem to have different effects on tear osmolarity table 4 . this may be an important factor because the type of eye drop can impact tear osmolarity.45 for instance lower osmolarity eye drops have been associated with lower tear osmolarity.4647 it has been noted that the decrease in osmolarity observed with the use of artificial tears may be comparable to the effects of heat and massage application to the eyelids using a thermal massager.44 the effect of anti inflammatory medication on tear osmolarity is less clear especially because the studies evaluating this effect suffer from limitations such as small sample size and the lack of a control group or randomization.4850 in one recent randomized double blind parallel study in finland osmolarity was observed to increase through the dry winter months.51 participants taking oral sea buckthorn oil containing n3 and n6 fatty acids and antioxidants had less of an increase in tear osmolarity when compared to a control group presumed to have been a function of the oil s anti inflammatory mechanism.51 evaluating the diagnostic ability of tear osmolarity requires specifying a value that discriminates a healthy eye from an eye with ded this value is known as the threshold value . in the literature tear osmolarity threshold values have varied from 305 mosm l8 to 316 mosm l.5 one reported reason for variability in tear osmolarity threshold values is tear film instability a hallmark characteristic of the disease.910 normal mild moderate and severe dry eyes had average tear osmolarity values of approximately 3028 mosm l 31510 mosm l and 336022 mosm l respectively.1011 another study had lower reported mean values but the study noted that they included more patients with

s anti inflammatory mechanism.51 a systematic review of 164 peer reviewed articles related to the diagnostic value of tear osmolarity found that 72 of them have a positive impression of the value of tear osmolarity as a diagnostic tool for ded . it may also be due to the difference in disease severity of the tested groups given the strong correlation between tear osmolarity and disease severity.911 the more severe the ded the higher the threshold and the greater the variability in the tear osmolarity value.9 the currently agreed upon value that discriminates between healthy and dry eyes is when the higher tear film osmolarity value of the two eyes is 308 mosm l.510 as with any diagnostic tool interpretation must be based on the complete clinical picture including other diagnostic tests that might be helpful in determining the dry eye etiology.10 certain commonly encountered external factors such as contact lens wear may or may not increase tear osmolarity depending on the individual response.224 the impact of environmental factors such as temperature humidity and airflow on tear osmolarity appears unclear as is the effect of sex hormones these factors would benefit from further investigation.2021253637 the effect of ocular surgery on tear osmolarity may be partially dependent on the patient s age the type of surgery performed and the ability of the eye to recover.2629 systemic conditions commonly believed to result in dry eye such as dehydration diabetes and thyroid ophthalmopathy have been shown to increase tear osmolarity as expected.313235 ocular conditions such as herpetic keratitis pterygia and pseudoexfoliation syndrome have also been demonstrated to increase tear osmolarity.383941 keratoconus largely viewed clinically as a non inflammatory condition was not associated with increased tear osmolarity.40 some pharmaceuticals such as mucin altering drugs and glaucoma medications appear to increase tear osmolarity while others such as artificial tears likely lower tear osmolarity.202843 research into the effect of anti inflammatory medications on tear osmolarity has produced varied results the topic deserves further investigation.484951 there are limitations in any review of this nature and consequently to any of our comments related to the factors associated with osmolarity .", " in veterans undergoing noncardiac surgery the incidence of preoperative anemia hematocrit 36 was 34 and in surgical patients who refused transfusions because of religious reasons 28 had preoperative hemoglobin levels less than 12 g dl . although it has been documented that patients prefer to receive autologous blood those who are anemic before surgery are not candidates for preoperative autologous donation pad . if hemoglobin levels fall even further during surgery due to blood losses as commonly occurs the likelihood of receiving an allogeneic blood transfusion increases . the importance of correcting preoperative anemia can not be overemphasized because this condition is known to be associated with poor outcomes after surgery . taken together these reports indicate that preoperative anemia is prevalent that anemia and blood transfusions are associated with risks and poor outcomes and that anemia should be treated preferably with strategies that exclude allogeneic blood . patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery who received rhuepo 300 units kg per day for 10 days preoperatively on the day of surgery and 4 days postoperatively had a nearly six fold reduction in allogeneic transfusion risk as compared with patients who received placebo . surgery in cancer patients represents a particular challenge because these patients may suffer severe anemia caused by their cancer or its treatment . in patients with a hemoglobin under 8.5 g dl and with colorectal cancer 300 iu kg rhuepo on day 4 before surgery followed by 150 iu kg for the next 7 days thereafter stimulated erythropoiesis and reduced transfusion requirements compared with placebo . transfusion requirements were reduced and hemoglobin levels were improved with preoperative rhuepo treatment in patients with gastrointestinal tract cancer and in those with rectal cancer undergoing surgery . in conclusion preoperative anemia can be effectively managed with minimal exposure to allogeneic transfusions in virtually all surgical specialties . rhuepo reduces transfusion requirements facilitates collection of preoperative autologous blood and is effective alone or with other blood conservation strategies in severe anemia . surgeons should enthusiastically adopt available therapies that help to avoid transfusions and their accompanying risks conserve blood and treat preoperative anemia with the goal of improving surgical outcomes .", " since modulation of intracellular ph phi and plasma membrane polarization has been shown to be involved in sperm motility and capacitation acrosome reaction of several mammalian species 1021 the present study was conducted to investigate the effect of curcumin on sperm intracellular ph and plasma membrane polarization . it was hypothesized that the curcumin mediated effect on sperm motility is caused by modulation of phi andor membrane polarization . the effect of curcumin on sperm forward motility was examined by incubating 10 100 l of sperm suspension

groups similar results were obtained in mouse sperm figure 3 panel b . treatment with curcumin caused significant p0.001 hyperpolarization of sperm plasma membrane as compared to control dmso treated sperm figure 3 panel b . the data indicated that curcumin affects sperm forward motility starting at 100 m concentration with a complete block at 200 m concentration within 5 10 min in both human and murine sperm . the present study was conducted to examine the mechanism by which curcumin affects sperm forward motility . the findings indicated that curcumin acidified sperm intracellularly and hyperpolarized cell membrane of both human and mouse sperm . these findings correlate well with the effect of curcumin on human and murine sperm forward motility . in this study curcumin induced hyperpolarization and intracellular acidification which correlate with a reduction block of sperm motility . although there is no publication which has examined the effect on sperm curcumin has been reported to affect membrane potential in other cell systems . the exact molecular mechanisms and signal transduction pathway involved in modulation of sperm intracellular ph and membrane potential by curcumin need further investigation . the findings indicate that curcumin causes intracellular acidification and membrane hyperpolarization which may be involved in inhibiting sperm forward motility . this is the first study to our knowledge that examined the effect of curcumin on sperm phi and membrane potential .", " splenic abscesses generally occur in patients with underlying comorbidities which commonly include neoplasia immunodeficiency trauma metastatic infection splenic infarct or diabetes . we report a young patient with a ruptured splenic abscess resulting in an acute abdomen and pneumoperitoneum . to our knowledge there have only been four other reported cases of ruptured splenic abscess causing pneumoperitoneum 3 4 . much to our surprise the patient did not have a perforated viscus but a splenic abscess that had ruptured causing the pneumoperitoneum fig . although a rare disease splenic abscess should be included on the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting to the hospital with peritonitis or pneumoperitoneum . however we had to convert to an open splenectomy due to the gross contamination and adhesions from the splenic abscess . in summary we have presented a case of ruptured splenic abscess as a cause of pneumoperitoneum and peritonitis . although rare we encourage splenic abscess be included on the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with peritonitis and pneumoperitoneum . although there is still controversy in the current literature when managing splenic abscesses our recommendation is splenectomy especially in the case of ruptured splenic abscess resulting in hemodynamic instability .", " in addition to the quantitative tumor volumetry based on digitised pretreatment ct scans ttv was estimated based on the postoperative histopathological report in patients treated with adjuvant radiotherapy . the locoregional failure free survival and the distant metastasis free survival were estimated by the cumulative incidence method and treatment groups were compared using the gray test 5 6 . for the method comparison the median follow up time for the censored patients treated with definitive radiotherapy radiochemotherapy was 28.5 months and for the patients treated with adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy 36.5 months . the 5year overall survival for the patients treated with definitive radiotherapy radiochemotherapy was 0.27 95 ci 0.180.35 and for the patients treated with postoperative radiotherapy 0.69 95 ci 0.590.79 . patients treated with definitive radiotherapy radiochemotherapy had a greater proportion of stage 4 tumors 96.9 versus 66.9 a much larger median ttv 68.4 cm versus 21.2 cm and a lower proportion of preradiotherapy hemoglobin level 12 g dl 17.6 versus 42.6 . on univariate analysis the ttv figures 1 and 2 and the pre radiotherapy hemoglobin level had a statistically significant impact on the overall survival and on the locoregional control of patients treated with definitive radiotherapy radiochemotherapy . the ttv was estimated using quantitative tumor volumetry of digitized pre treatment ct scans in all patients . the tumor volume has been stated to be one of the most precise and most relevant predictor of radiotherapy outcome . for patients with oro and hypopharyngeal cancer treated with definitive radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy the quantitative tumor volume was identified as significant prognostic factor in the majority of studies 1020 and in few studies as a prognostic factor of marginal 21 22 or no significance . in the multivariate analysis of our study the total tumor volume had a statistically highly significant impact on the overall survival and locoregional control on patients treated with definitive radiotherapy radiochemotherapy . for this patient group our data suggest that the total tumor volume should be used to select patients for an intensified definitive or postoperative adjuvant treatment . the only other significant prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis for patients treated with definitive radiotherapy in our study was the application of a simultaneous chemotherapy . a significant association of the pre radiotherapy hemoglobin concentration with the treatment outcome after definitive radiotherapy radiochemotherapy in the absence of quantitative tumor volume data has been reported by several studies in the literature 3846 . on multivariate analysis the potential prognostic factors gender age pre radiotherapy hemoglobin level tumor site t and n and r status rt interruptions 5 days and interval surgery rt 32 days showed no statistical significance in our study . the total tumor volume should be used to identify high risk patients and to stratify patients in clinical trials or statistical analyses .", " memory functions seem most affected particularly those related to source memory episodic or explicit . some evidence suggests that women show less age associated cognitive decline than men . our data on young adults age 1 8 45 years indicate that men show significant decline in several neurocognitivc domains while women evince no decline . we have initially studied sex difference in neurocognitivc measures with a standardized battery that examines 8 neurobehavioral domains . in a sample of 241 healthy young adults aged 18 to 45 124 men 117 premenopausal women women had better verbal memory and men performed better on spatial and motor tasks . in examining components of domains that show sex differences we find that the verbal memory advantage for women is accounted for primarily by performance on the california verbal learning test cvlt figure 2 whereas the advantage for men in spatial abilities is accounted for by performance on benton s line orientation test . for men however increased age was associated with decrease in performance on attention r0.43 p0.0001 verbal memory r0.20 p0.029 spatial memory r0.34 p0.0001 and spatial abilities r0.33 p0.0002 all df122 all p values are 2tailed figure 3 . there is more consistency in the regional distribution of effects with mesolimbic temporal and frontal regions showing greater vulnerability . sex differences have been observed in the compartmental composition of intracranial volumes in the volume and density of language associated cortex and in the rate of age associated changes . while the data indicate less parenchymal loss in women than in men particularly for frontal and temporal regions samples were limited in the elderly cohorts . while the volume of limbic structures was unrelated to cognitive functions across the age range in older participants reduction predicted declines in explicit memory . neural substrates for age related changes in affect are less clearly defined although recent work affords some hypotheses that should be tested . the link between age related changes in neuroanatomy and performance on such tasks has not been established . our sample also enabled examination of whether these volume changes are related to cognitive performance . the study of age effects on regional brain physiology has been quite extensive with considerable agreement that cerebral blood flow cbf shows age related decline even in people screened for cerebrovascular disorders . there are fewer data on the effects of aging on regional brain activation in response to task demands . using the 133xe method we found substantial age related decline in overall cbf values but the pattern of lateralized changes in response to verbal and spatial tasks was identical in young and elderly people . however we used tasks that are quite resistant to age effects and the results may differ for tasks showing greater age related decline . indeed cabeza ct al found less frontal activation measured with h2 0 pet cbf in elderly people for a memory task . madden et al in a cbf study using spect reported that several cbf activations were greater for young than for older adults . however they observed that although performance demonstrated a greater age related slowing for visual encoding than for semantic retrieval these changes were not associated with corresponding changes in rcbf activation . unlike neuroanatomic studies that have consistently examined sex differences and age effects there is a paucity of neurophysiologic studies that have examined these factors . using the xe cbf method we reported that women have higher rates of cortical cbf and this finding was replicated and extended to other methods that measure cbf for the entire cranium . there is increasing evidence across behavioral neuroanatomic and neurophysiologic domains that sex differences play a prominent role in modulating the effects of aging on brain function . more specific tasks using a computerized approach can help better delineate associations between agerelated decline and aspects of cognitive and emotion processing . although we have focused on findings in healthy people the effects have implications for brain disorders where gender differences have been observed across the life span . understanding the neural basis of these disorders can be advanced by considering sex differences in brain function . in view of the greater vulnerability of males in prefrontal regions one would expect brain disorders affecting these regions to be more severe and perhaps requiring multimodal therapeutic interventions .", " moreover inflammatory airway and lung diseases such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd are characterized by chronic inflammation . it has been shown that lung cells release inflammatory mediators and cytokines chemokines such as il1 il6 il8 and tnf in response to oxidative stress . moreover the sfks pkc growth factor tyrosine kinase receptors nadph oxidase ros pi3k akt and mapks are components of signaling cascades that respond to extracellular stimuli by targeting transcription factors such as nfb and ap1 resulting in the modulation of inflammatory gene expression . thus this review will focus on some general aspects of inflammatory signaling regulation and summarize current knowledge regarding the presence and functional roles of these inflammatory signal molecules within the respiratory system and their proposed involvement in the expression inflammatory target proteins in response to proinflammatory mediators during airway and lung inflammation . the pharmacological interventions protect against inflammation induced airway and lung diseases will be discussed . accumulation of inflammatory cells within the airways can be influenced by expression of adhesion molecules on airway epithelium . thus similar processes that govern pmns adhesion to lung airway resident cells may occur and contribute to the damage to these cells seen in inflammatory responses of asthma . thus adhesion molecules play a key role in regulating inflammation in respiratory disorders figure 1 the first class of pla2 is secretary pla2 spla2 that is expressed in a variety of cell types and it has no preference for aa at sn2 position requires millimolar amounts of ca for activity and is sensitive to sulfhydryl reducing agents such as dithiothreitol dtt and is resistant to heat or acid conditions . thus cpla2 seems to function as a crucial upstream regulator of the production of eicosanoids for airway resistance during allergic inflammation and is correlated to the process of asthma figure 1 . the inhibition of cpla2mediated pathways may also provide a therapeutic approach to airway and lung injury . cox metabolites have diverse effects in the lung and are known to modify airway tone as well as inflammatory responses . thus the inhibition of cox2mediated inflammatory pathway may provide a therapeutic approach to respiratory diseases . pkcs are important in many cellular responses in the lung including permeability contraction migration hypertrophy proliferation apoptosis and secretion . moreover pkcs are important signaling intermediates in chronic airway diseases like asthma and copd . resident airway epithelial cells produce proinflammatory mediators under the regulation of pkc . increased pkc activity increases nfb dependent proinflammatory cytokine generation in human airway epithelial cells while expression of a dominant negative pkc mutant has inhibiting effects . bk also induces cox2 protein expression and pge2 accumulation in human airway smooth muscle cells via a pkcdependent signaling . pkc activity is also increased in proliferating human airway smooth muscle cells . on the other hand pkc is important in mediating the effects of proinflammatory cytokines by phosphorylating cpla2 leading to the release of aa from phospholipids with subsequent production of bioactive eicosanoids in activated cells . selected pkcs are activated by lps leading to the production of the proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf il and il6 . taken together these studies indicated that pkcs play a critical role in mediating inflammation and respiratory diseases figure 2 . because multiple signaling pathways contribute to the key cellular responses important in lung biology therapeutic strategies targeting pkcs may be more effective if combined with inhibitors of other pathways for additive or synergistic effect . mechanisms that regulate pkc activity including phosphorylation and interaction with isozyme specific binding proteins are also potential therapeutic targets in the respiratory diseases . in in vitro studies using macrophages alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells ros have been shown to induce gene expression of inflammatory mediators such as il1 and tnf 57 58 . thus oxidative stress plays a critical role in inflammatory responses in airway and lung diseases via the upregulation of redox sensitive transcription factors such as ap1 or nfb and thereby proinflammatory genes such as mmp9 vcam1 icam1 cox2 or cpla2 expression . it is therefore understandable that dysregulation of pi3k has been implicated in the induction andor progression of a variety of disease states including those of the respiratory tract ranging from asthma to cancer . thus pi3k inhibition was indicated to have therapeutic potential for the treatment of asthmatic airway inflammation . thus pi3k family plays a prominent role in various airway and lung inflammation figure 2 . moreover we reported that tnf or il1 induces vcam1 and icam1 expression via a c src dependent pathway in human airway smooth muscle cells . in addition c src has been shown to regulate cox2pge2il6dependent airway inflammation via nadph oxidase ros . systemic inhibition of these kinases using specific small molecule inhibitors for src ptks either pp2 or su6656 significantly attenuated lps induced lung injury and capillary permeability and reduced lps dependent cytokine and chemokine levels in the lung and the serum . thus the role of src family ptks in inflammatory responses is a rising area of research figure 2 . however application of small chemical inhibitors to effectively and specifically block src ptks could have a great clinical implication for airway and lung diseases with inflammatory responses as underlying mechanisms . aberrant expression or signaling patterns of these receptors have also been linked to the progression of a diversity of diseases including asthma . multiple studies have also reported that stimulation of airway epithelial cells by lps induces the secretion of il8 via a cellular cascade involving a tlr4myeloid differentiation primary response gene myd88nfb dependent pathway . thus the inhibition of mapks activity via pharmacological or genetic approaches blocks allergic inflammation of airways . furthermore inhibition of the p38 mapk pathway was shown to exert anti inflammatory effects through inhibition of il1 il6 and tnf expression . in airway smooth muscle cells there is solid evidence that both erk and p38 mapk pathways contribute to il1induced cox2 expression and pge2 synthesis 76 77 . in addition we also found that lta or il1 could induce cpla2 cox2 or mmp9 in human airway smooth muscle cells or a549 cells 3 44 . therefore mapks play an important role in mediating airway and lung inflammation figure 2 . previous study demonstrated that nfb activation occurred rapidly in the ovalbumin ova model of allergic airways disease and that nfb activation predominantly occurred in the epithelial cells of the conducting airways in association with enhanced mrna expression of nfb regulated chemokine genes including mip2 and eotaxin . taken together these results show that nfb plays a key role in mediating the expression of inflammatory proteins in airway and lung inflammation and injury figure 2 . there is evidence for increased expression of c fos in epithelial cells in asthmatic airways and many of the stimuli relevant to asthma that activate nfb will also activate ap1 . inflammatory airway and lung diseases are characterized by chronic inflammation and oxidant antioxidant imbalance a major cause of cell damage injury . there is an increasing evidence that inflammatory proteins such as vcam1 icam1 cpla2 cox2 and mmp9 are involved in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases such as asthma and copd figure 3 . moreover various inflammatory signaling pathways including pkcs nadph oxidase ros egfr pdgfr c src pi3k akt mapks ap1 and nfb are involved in the regulation of these inflammatory proteins figure 3 . although the use of inhibitors of inflammatory signaling pathways in the treatment of respiratory diseases seems very attractive further studies are needed to identify the exact role of inflammatory signaling molecules in these diseases and to develop highly specific inhibitors .", " in 1964 there have been some reports till date that describe the association of malignant neoplasms with potter type iii cystic disease of the liver and kidney 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 however most of these describe pancreatic and hepatobiliary neoplasms arising in patients with polycystic liver and kidney diseases including adpkd and no report has described the association of gastric carcinoma with potter type iii cystic disease of the liver and kidney . in 1972 they also observed cysts in the liver andor pancreas in 58 of these patients hence they described this condition as potter type iii polycystic disease . therefore according to hatfield and pfister s criteria we considered that this case of association of apld with multiple renal cysts could be classified as potter type iii cystic disease . in the absence of a family history of adpkd bilateral multiple renal cysts with hepatic cysts together with the absence of other manifestations suggesting a different renal cystic disease provide evidence for diagnosis . reports on the association of malignant neoplasm with apld and adpkd potter type iii cystic disease are extremely rare . reported 2 patients from the same family a brother and a sister with adpkd who developed adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction however these patients did not have cysts in the liver or other organs except for the kidney . in the present case although a detailed family history could not be obtained multiple cysts were observed in the liver both kidneys and mesenterium . although it is unclear whether the development of multiple gastric carcinomas is directly associated with the pathogenesis of cysts in the liver mesenterium and kidney the present case demonstrates that gastric carcinoma can be an external complication in patients with polycystic disease .", " in this case the extra inner canalicular epithelial bud nearer to the main epithelial cord

imposes a large economic burden on the individual national healthcare systems and countries.15 healthcare expenditures due to diabetes account for 11 of the total healthcare expenditures in the world in 2011 . on average the estimated healthcare spending due to diabetes was 5063 per person with diabetes in high income countries compared with 271 in low and middle income countries . worldwide the estimated number of adults living with diabetes has soared to 366 million representing 8.3 of the global adult population . this number is projected to increase to 552 million people by 2030 or 9.9 of adults which equates to approximately three more people with diabetes every 10 or almost 10 million per year.78 the kingdom of saudi arabia is not exception of this global pandemic . over the past four decades the ageing of populations together with rapid socio economic development progressive urbanization decreasing infant mortality and increasing life expectancy and tremendous changes in lifestyle towards the westernized pattern reflected by changes in nutrition less physical activity tendency to increased obesity and more smoking has resulted in the dramatic increase in the diabetes prevalence.916 worldwide the desire of many healthcare players governments diabetes associations health professionals health economists and people with diabetes themselves to reduce the economic burden of diabetes and its related complications costs makes the question of economic impact of diabetes an important component in determining the present economic burden of diabetes and its related

government healthcare system predicting the likely future economic burden of diabetes and its related complications and developing effective policies and strategies about treatment of diabetes and its related complications and the future public health spending related diabetes healthcare costs . the purpose of this research study therefore is to determine the economic impact of diabetes mellitus dm on saudi arabia s healthcare system both now and in the future . this research study however focuses on the prevalence of diabetes and aims at estimating and predicting the total and per capita healthcare expenditure for people diagnosed with diabetes . to examine and predict the economic impact of diabetes costs on saudi arabia s healthcare system this study relied on data provided by ministry of health moh and ministry of finance mof for the years 1992 and 2010 databases.1921 the 1992 and 2010 time period is used as the study time frame . it should be noted that this study is based on single source of diabetic data moh database only therefore it does not account for the considerable number of people diagnosed with diabetes in other healthcare providers such as private and semi private healthcare services military universities arabian american oil company aramco healthcare services etc . dividing healthcare expenditures by the size of the population with and without diabetes provides an estimate of per capita healthcare expenditures . by multiplying diabetes population figures by the per capita healthcare expenditures the total healthcare budget for people diagnosed with diabetes is derived . this increased prevalence of diabetes over the period of study is not only attributable to changing pattern of saudi lifestyle due to rapid socio economic development together with increased obesity smoking and less physical activities but may also be attributed to increased awareness programs related to diabetes and its health complications community screening campaigns for diabetes better diagnostic facilities specially in health centers and healthcare units and better diabetes management systems and protocols . the population of age 60 years and above diagnosed with diabetes is growing by more than 33.6 thousand people per year . it is well documented that the population with the highest use of healthcare resources attributed to diabetes is the population aged 60 years and above.3438 healthcare expenditure attributed to diabetes reflects the additional expenditures the nation incurs because of diabetes . in 2010 on average people diagnosed with diabetes have medical healthcare expenditures that are ten times higher 3686 vs. 380 than what expenditures would be in the absence of diabetes 1 us dollar 3.75 saudi riyal . healthcare expenditures by diabetes status nationality sex and age groups 1992 and 2010 in usa dollars dividing total attributed healthcare expenditures by the number of people diagnosed with diabetes gives an estimate of the average annual excess expenditures for the population under age 15 age 15 44 age 45 60 and age 60 and above at 9244 1255 767 and 1442 respectively . per capita healthcare expenditure for male female population diagnosed with diabetes is equal to some extent to the per capita healthcare expenditure of male female population without diabetes . the economic burden of diabetes on saudi arabia is expected to be approximately 2.4 billion in 2015 table 3 . given the expected increase in the number of people diagnosed with diabetes in saudi arabia the proportion of public healthcare spending is expected to escalate from 9.3 in 2010 to 13.1 in 2015 and to 18.3 by 2020 . it is well documented that the population with the highest use of healthcare resources attributed to

because a significant number of cases are not included in the analysis.omitted from the cost estimates is the indirect cost associated with diabetes such as lost productivity due to disease related absenteeism unemployment due to disease related disability lost productivity due to early mortality by disease as well as the social cost of intangibles such as pain and suffering and care provided by non paid caregivers . to sum up further research studies are needed to improve our understanding of economic costs of diabetes and its substantial burden to saudi healthcare system .", " these data were used to study the variability of the fasting glucose levels over time and to assess the appropriateness of using a single baseline fasting glucose measurement to assess the relationship between fasting glucose and cognitive function and decline . the relationship between baseline prosper or third survey rotterdam study fasting glucose levels and cognitive function and decline was assessed by use of linear mixed models . these data were used to study the variability of the fasting glucose levels over time and to assess the appropriateness of using a single baseline fasting glucose measurement to assess the relationship between fasting glucose and cognitive function and decline . the relationship between baseline prosper or third survey rotterdam study fasting glucose levels and cognitive function and decline was assessed by use of linear mixed models . the 1806 participants without a final examination comprised 20.8 of the participants without a history of diabetes and 26.3 of the participants with a history of diabetes at baseline prosper or at the third survey rotterdam study . figure 1a shows the relationship between fasting glucose levels and cognitive function at baseline for the 8447 participants of the merged study sample . cognitive test scores are shown for quintiles of the distribution of fasting glucose levels in participants without a history of diabetes and for participants with a history of diabetes . in participants without a history of diabetes a rise in fasting glucose levels in the nondiabetes range was not associated with impairment in cognitive function for any of the cognitive tests . additionally we compared the cognitive test scores at baseline for participants with and without a history of diabetes fig . 1a and showed that participants with a history of diabetes had worse cognitive function across the majority of tests at baseline when compared with participants without a history of diabetes p 0.05 for all tests except for the wft in the rotterdam study sample . z scores sem for different cognitive test scores are plotted for study specific quintiles of fasting glucose levels in nondiabetic participants from lowest quintile 1 to the highest quintile 5 levels of fasting glucose and for participants with a history of diabetes dm . in the longitudinal analyses of the study population there was no clear association between baseline fasting glucose levels and change in cognitive function during follow up in participants without a history of diabetes fig . higher levels of fasting glucose were associated with a decreased rate of decline on the 12plt ptrend 0.039 but this was not seen for any of the other cognitive tests . additionally we assessed the relationship between insulin resistance and cognitive function and decline for the 3342 participants of the rotterdam study sample for whom fasting insulin levels were available fig . the relationship between insulin resistance and cognitive function was in accordance with findings on fasting glucose levels and cognitive function in participants without a history of diabetes rising insulin resistance was not associated with cognitive function . z scores sem for different cognitive test scores are plotted for quintiles of insulin resistance homa in nondiabetic participants from lowest quintile 1 to the highest quintile 5 levels of insulin resistance homa and for participants with a history of diabetes dm . our study shows that in an unprecedented large number of individuals from two independent prospective studies higher levels of fasting glucose in the absence of a history of diabetes are not associated with cognitive function or cognitive decline . although our data show that those with a history of diabetes have worse cognitive function at baseline than those without one could argue that the effect sizes are lower than expected based on the previous report of an almost twofold increased risk of dementia for people with diabetes 22 . these results are not in agreement with our results on the relationship between insulin resistance and cognitive decline in the rotterdam study sample . the prolonged length of follow up 10 years compared with 4.6 years in the nurses health study could have affected these results as the effect of insulin resistance on cognitive function might be long term . on the other hand results from the ongoing memory in diabetes mind substudy of the action to control cardiovascular risk in diabetes accord trial showed that higher a1c but not fasting plasma glucose levels was associated with worse cognitive function in a sample of almost 3000 participants 24 which is in line with our results . the known association between these cardiovascular risk factors and cognitive function and decline might have interfered with our investigation of the relationship between fasting glucose levels and cognitive function and decline . however when we excluded the 2823 participants in prosper who had a history of vascular disease from the sample of 5019 participants the relationship between fasting glucose levels and cognitive function at baseline did not markedly differ from our findings in the total sample there was no clear relationship between fasting glucose levels and cognitive function in participants without a history of vascular disease . the relationship between fasting glucose levels and change in cognitive function did not markedly change after exclusion of the participants with a history of vascular disease . the same was seen for the analyses on the relationship between history of diabetes and change in cognitive function . therefore we do not think that the inclusion of participants with preexisting vascular disease in prosper has masked a possible association between fasting glucose and insulin resistance on cognitive function . we used fasting insulin levels that were available for almost the entire sample of the rotterdam study to calculate the homa index as a measure of insulin resistance to further investigate the relationship between glucose metabolism and cognitive function . however the relationship between insulin resistance and cognitive function and decline showed similarities with the association between fasting glucose levels and cognitive function and decline in participants without a history of diabetes insulin resistance was not associated with cognitive function or decline . although it is difficult to address the role of these suggested mechanisms our study of 8000 participants shows that the effect of increased fasting glucose levels on cognitive function seems to be long term and independent of other cardiovascular risk factors like bmi blood pressure and hdl cholesterol levels . the observed differences in cognitive test scores between people with and without a history of diabetes were relatively moderate and may therefore lack clinical significance for individuals . furthermore we had the possibility of studying the variability of fasting glucose levels during follow up and of examining the appropriateness of using a single measurement of fasting glucose level to assess the association between fasting glucose levels and cognitive function and decline . this selective attrition of participants with relatively high levels of fasting glucose and concurrent low levels of cognitive function could have resulted in an underestimation of our estimates of cognitive decline for participants with a history of diabetes . in conclusion elevations in fasting glucose levels are not clearly associated with impaired cognitive function or with an accelerated rate of cognitive decline in participants without a history of diabetes .", " found that ocular dryness affects 20 of wearers of new generation silicone hydrogel contact lenses as well as 24 of wearers of older generation low oxygen permeable phema lenses . subjects with induced ocular dryness by contact lens wear usually tend to drop out from this modality when the benefits of the lenses are outweighed by the discomfort they feel especially during the last hours of wear day after day . this discontinuation rate represents a continuous loss for the industry and for eyecare professionals and the quest to find new methods to prevent induced dryness of the ocular surface is an ongoing concern . when materials proved not to be a solution to the problem of dry eye researchers turned their attention to the lens design spherical versus aspherical the edge profile sharp and thin versus rounded and thicker the fit of the lens on the eye flat or steep and the replacement rate 2 weeks versus 1 month . on insertion the lens balances out with the surrounding ocular environment and the biocides absorbed by the lens matrix are released into the eye possibly contributing to a temporary alteration of the ocular surface especially during the first four hours of wear . in fact it is believed that the use of this product instilled in the lens before insertion would chemically neutralize the biocide effects on the ocular surface helping to alleviate initial and long term discomfort associated to contact lens wear . after being enrolled subjects were asked to observe a wash out period of 72 hours without contact lenses before the beginning of the study . once recruited the subject was provided with a new pair of contact lens and the care regimen steps were reviewed according to the manufacturer s recommendations . for half of the subjects they were told to wear the lens for a month on a daily wear basis and to not use any drops prior to insertion of the lenses . for the other half they were told to instill a sodium hyaluronate based comfort drop blink contacts abbott amo irvine ca in the lens not in the eye before insertion . the first questionnaire used in this study is the contact lens dry eye questionnaire cldeq . this questionnaire had already been validated and is sensitive and specific at predicting a diagnosis of dry eye associated with the wearing of contact lenses . in addition to the cldeq questionnaire subjects were asked to complete a brief survey about their contact lens experience over the last month . for the next month the subjects that did not use sh were asked to put a drop of a sodium hyaluronate sh based product blink contacts amo abbott irvine ca on the lens before insertion . this ocular sign was markedly reduced with the use of sh drop before insertion of the lens . overall there is a marked difference in the reduction of the severity of eye dryness felt by the patient q5b chi square f461 9.538 p 0.0008 r 0.1847 after 2 hours of wear q5c f261 2.8366 p 005 r 0.1439 and at the end of the wearing time q5d f461 11.6696 p 0.00 r 0.1999 . the use of sh drop helps to reduce almost by half the number of subjects experiencing blurry vision during their contact lens wear . in other words 10 of the subjects experiencing eye soreness and irritation became asymptomatic with the use of a comfort drop on the lens before insertion . at v1 21 of the subjects admit removing their lenses many times week because of discomfort while only 11 report the same at v2 . this is a 50 reduction of symptomatic patients with the use of a sh based drop on the lens before insertion . over 60 of subjects reported a very comfortable comfortable lens during the evening after more than 10 hours of wear compared with 52 without the use of the drops . this study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcome from the instillation of sh drop as an additional step in the wearing regimen of contact lens wearers on contact lens related comfort and visual performance over the day . the results of the present study prove that sodium hyaluronate based drops can be added to the list of products that can help symptomatic contact lens wearers to reduce their overall discomfort cldeq q4 but especially at the end of the day q4 subquestions when it matters most . there is a significant reduction of blurry vision reported by the subjects on visit 2 which means that the use of sh drops probably helps to maintain tear film stability and also contributes to reduce lens dehydration . in this study the use of a sh drop initiated a switch for a significant percentage of the wearers from symptomatic to asymptomatic eye soreness and irritation cldeq q7 . for these subjects discomfort was no longer a reason to remove their contact lenses prematurely cldeq q13 . clinical findings observed through slit lamp were also improved with the use of sh drops on the lens before insertion . consequently we can say that the use of sh drops before insertion helps to address the two major reasons why patients cease to wear contact lens wear discomfort and vision and contributes to a reduction in the physiological impact from contact lens wear . it is easy to realize the impact on wearers practitioners and the contact lens industry if with just one easy additional step before lens insertion it is possible to keep 10 more of the wearers in contact lenses on an ongoing basis and to improve symptoms of others by 50 to 60 . a single drop put on the lens before insertion can considerably change the contact lens experience for subjects who report ocular dryness . even subjects using a hydrogen peroxide system found a positive effect from the use of sh drop before lens insertion . practitioners therefore should not hesitate to recommend this step to their symptomatic wearers in order to improve their overall contact lens experience . a sodium hyaluronate drop before insertion of contact lenses improves the overall comfort but its clinical effect is highly significant at the end of the wearing period during the evening . because of that it is possible to say that the use of sh based drops blink contacts before insertion addresses the two major reasons why contact lens wearers drop out from the market . the use of sh drops before insertion should be considered to improve overall contact lens performance for symptomatic contact lens wearers .", "we are grateful for financial support from the industrial source technology development program of the

genetic epidemiological studies of autism bipolar disorder and schizophrenia show that the risk of developing one of these specific psychiatric illnesses is proportional to the amount of genetic material shared with an affected individual . definitive genetic epidemiological studies of the genetic relationship between autism and these disorders are lacking although there is some evidence for shared genetic factors . however missense mutations were subsequently identified in the neurexin1 nrxn1 gene at a high frequency in individuals with autism . a further study of over 1000 pedigrees using approximately 10000 single nucleotide polymorphisms snps identified a 300 kb deletion of coding exons of nrxn1 co segregating with autism . however hemizygosity of the cntnap2 gene which encodes a member of the neurexin family contactin associated protein like 2 caspr2 has been reported in schizophrenia and also in individuals with mental retardation . although the available data provide relatively strong evidence that disruption of the neurexin1 locus nrxn1 is a risk factor for schizophrenia and asds evidence in relation to bipolar disorder is lacking . the recent application of genome wide technologies has shown that the burden of large rare cnvs is increased in schizophrenia when compared with controls and that this implicates specific loci . therefore just as for nrxn1 deletions it is apparent that these large cnvs confer risk of a range of neurodevelopmental phenotypes including autism mental retardation and schizophrenia . the advent of the gwas has allowed most of the common snp variation in the human genome to be tested for association and the first wave of such studies has been reported for schizophrenia bipolar disorder 54 56 and autism . furthermore there have been recent reports of association for common alleles at several gaba receptor genes in a subtype of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia which implicate loci also reported as associated with asds 2363 65 . there is also strong evidence implicating some of these genes in schizophrenia although not all of them have been examined . whole genome studies of many thousands of affected individuals are uncovering evidence for genetic overlap between autism schizophrenia and bipolar disorder . studies of cnvs and other rare alleles have found overlap between autism and schizophrenia whereas those of common snp variants have shown overlap between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder . these findings suggest that schizophrenia autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders may share underlying pathogenic mechanisms and challenges the view that these are completely unrelated diagnostic entities . the findings also support the view that schizophrenia has a stronger neurodevelopmental component than bipolar disorder and suggest that it lies on a gradient of decreasing neurodevelopmental impairment between syndromes such as mental retardation and autism on one hand and bipolar disorder on the other . we have based this conclusion on the fact that several rare cnvs including deletions of nrxn1 are associated with mental retardation autism and schizophrenia and on the overlap in common risk alleles seen between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder 11 13 . asd autism spectrum disorder cnv copy number variant cgh comparative genome hybridization gwas genome

thermometers many parents rely on palpation to assess if their children have fever.4 the objective use of the thermometer to detect the presence of fever is often limited to health care settings in most resource poor settings . in a study in new york usa of the 78 of caregivers that owned thermometers nearly half 48 still utilised tactile method to assess fever.4 in another study in india in contrast only 15 owned thermometer with 23.8 of them not knowing how to use it.5 this underscores the fact that the use of palpation as a means of assessing fever by mothers is common and universal . controversies over the reliability of tactile assessment of fever have been variously reported while a study found it accurate enough at least in younger infants4 others reported that it overestimates the presence of fever.67 the reliability of the use of palpation to detect fever still remains uncertain . this study was carried out to determine the reliability of tactile assessment of fever by nigerian mothers in under5 children and also to determine if the surface of the hand used influence the accuracy . fever detected by touch was reported in 81 71.6 children by mothers while only 65 57.5 mothers were able to correctly predict the presence of fever in their children . comparison of fever detection by palpation with the mothers highest educational qualification heq irrespective of the part of hand used for palpation the sensitivity of detection of fever by palpation was 82.4 while the specificity was 37.1 . sites used by the mothers to palpate for fever palpation of single site versus multiple sites the present study shows that mothers can be trusted to a good extent to assess for the presence of fever in children by palpation . although the specificity in the present study was poor the relatively high sensitivities obtained in all the studies still make maternal palpation for the presence of fever a considerably useful method of assessment of childhood fever . mothers should be taught to palpate at multiple sites with the palmer surface when palpating for the presence of fever in their children to improve the accuracy .", " moreover several lines of evidence implicate mutations inactivating the brca2 tumour suppressor in an estimated 520 of familial pdac hahn et al . germline carriers of deleterious brca2 mutations that commonly truncate the encoded protein exhibit an increased lifetime risk of developing pdac in addition to their well known predisposition to cancers of the breast and ovary breast cancer linkage consortium 1999 . within high risk pancreatic cancer kindreds inherited mutations in brca2 represent the most frequently encountered germline genetic alteration hahn et al . the incidence of germline brca2 mutations in apparently sporadic pancreatic cancers may be as high as in breast or ovarian cancer goggins et al . more recently palb2 which encodes a brca2interacting protein also essential for homology directed dna repair has emerged as a pancreatic cancer susceptibility allele jones et al . patients who carry germline mutations affecting brca2 harbour the germline mutant allele in all somatic tissues whereas the second brca2 allele is wildtype wooster et al . it has been widely believed that loss of the second wild type brca2 allele in nascent cancer cells termed loss of heterozygosity or loh is necessary for the emergence of tumours in germline mutation carriers . thus it should be clear from the foregoing that these three recently published models for pancreatic carcinogenesis associated with brca2 inactivation harbour important differences not only in the tissue specificity nature and timing of mutant tp53 and brca2 alleles but also in the presence of mutant kras . brca2 has been believed to follow the classical two hit paradigm for tumour suppression smith et al . initial studies soon after the discovery of brca2 reported consistent inactivation of the wild type brca2 allele through loss of heterozygosity loh in breast or ovarian cancer cells from mutation carriers collins et al . 1995 engendering the widely accepted view that brca2 loh is an essential event in carcinogenesis . in this context unexpectedly reveal that brca2 heterozygosity promotes pancreatic cancer development in mice and men . in both the tp53 wildtype and tp53 cohorts from the murine model heterozygosity for brca2 through the brca2 genotype acts with kras to accelerate the progression and development of pdac . a similar conclusion is reached from studies on a small number of human pancreatic cancer samples from carriers of the icelandic founder mutation in brca2 the allele brca2 which is 5 bp deletion in exon 9 that causes a frame shift leading to the expression of a very short and unstable protein product mikaelsdottir et al . thus there is little convincing evidence that heterozygosity for these brca2 mutant alleles creates a dna repair defect that could explain heightened cancer predisposition although the possibility has not yet been conclusively excluded . in this connection it is important to note that these cellular approaches do not yet account for the cooperative effect of mutant kras on pancreatic carcinogenesis associated with brca2 heterozygosity as suggested by the murine model developed by skoulidis et al . even a subtle increase in mutational load induced by brca2 heterozygosity in mutant kras expressing cells which might be undetectable in cellular experiments but significant in vivo could plausibly accelerate the progression of pre malignant pancreatic intra epithelial panin lesions which occur frequently even in apparently normal pancreatic parenchyma hruban et al . whether different brca2 alleles behave in a manner similar to brca2 is not clear . like brca2 however the instability of the truncated protein encoded by brca2 mikaelsdottir et al . describe no heterozygous effect in any of their brca2 cohorts despite the presence of mutant kras . this raises the possibility that non cell autonomous effects of brca2 heterozygosity for example on stromal cells rather than the nascent cancer cells may account for the cancer predisposing effect of the brca2 allele . 2004 whether or not these roles for brca2 may explain the effect of heterozygosity in tumour development is yet to be explored . importantly recent data from human studies further support that brca2 heterozygosity is enough to promote carcinogenesis . collectively these data suggest that cancers arising in germline brca2 mutation carriers frequently fail to exhibit loss of the wildtype allele and that failure to exhibit loh occurs in brca2mutant cancers from several different tissues . however definitive evidence addressing the extent to which the lessons from gemms of brca2deficient pancreatic cancers can be applied to human neoplasia awaits the results of more extensive genome sequencing studies on pancreatic cancer samples from patients harbouring germline brca2 mutations . murine pancreatic cancers emerging in brca2 strains in which both brca2 alleles are inactivated in pdx1cre expressing cells exhibit a preponderance of acinar cell carcinoma histology . correspondingly 3 of the four human pancreatic cancers from brca2 mutation carriers that exhibited loh were also of the acinar type skoulidis et al . 2011 also observe differences in the histopathological spectrum of pancreatic malignancies from mice in which brca2 as well as tp53 had been inactivated when compared to tp53 deficiency alone . these observations raise the possibility that the nature of brca2 mutations their timing or their coincidence with alterations with tp53 may alter the histopathological evolution of pancreatic cancers in mice . when the observations from these studies are synthesized a picture emerges wherein brca2 heterozygosity in germline mutation carriers may suffice to allow the development of kras driven pdac . our results suggest that brca2 heterozygosity suffices for pdac formation driven by mutant kras in mice and men . because pdac gemms incorporate high penetrance genetic events such as initiating oncogenes or inactivated tumour suppressor genes from an early stage in a large number of susceptible cells the resulting stereotypy of the malignancies arising therein may not reflect the heterogeneity likely to be present in human cancers . brca2 in models of pancreatic cancer may promote the stochastic acquisition of genetic and consequent morphologic heterogeneity due to the expected increase in mutation rate .", " indeed crbsi is associated with a 2.27fold increased risk of mortality in the icu . therefore the aim of the present study was to assess the risk factors and catheter characteristics of 73 cases of nosocomial crbsi in the icu between january 2010 and december 2012 . the clinical data of patients with nosocomial crbsi were collected and analyzed in accordance with the 2009 clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of intravascular catheter related infection from the infectious diseases society of america idsa . patients age sex reason of icu admission underlying diseases time and position of indwelling cvc type of cvc pathogenic identification treatment prognosis and mortality attributable to crbsi were reviewed . patients with timely cvc removal and appropriate antibiotic use were assigned to group a. patients with timely cvc removal and inappropriate antibiotic use were assigned to group b. patients with untimely cvc removal and appropriate antibiotic use were assigned to group c. finally patients with untimely cvc removal and inappropriate antibiotic use were assigned to group d. all continuous data are expressed as means standard deviation sd . the clinical data of patients with nosocomial crbsi were collected and analyzed in accordance with the 2009 clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of intravascular catheter related infection from the infectious diseases society of america idsa . patients age sex reason of icu admission underlying diseases time and position of indwelling cvc type of cvc pathogenic identification treatment prognosis and mortality attributable to crbsi were reviewed . univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that an acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii apache ii score 23 parenteral nutrition or transfusion of blood products age 65 years diabetes 3 types of underlying diseases renal insufficiency or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome mods and immunosuppression or chemoradiotherapy were correlated with the occurrence of crbsi within 14 days of cvc indwelling table 2 . apache ii score 20 and 3 types of underlying diseases were independent risk factors of crbsi occurring within 14 days of cvc indwelling table 3 . the duration of cvc indwelling until crbsi occurrence is shown in table 4 . femoral cvc showed the shortest time to crbsi onset 14.25.1 days followed by internal jugular cvc 20.98.0 and subclavian cvc 33.83.9 all p0.05 . the major treatment for patients with crbsi was cvc removal and the use of effective antibiotics . univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that an acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii apache ii score 23 parenteral nutrition or transfusion of blood products age 65 years diabetes 3 types of underlying diseases renal insufficiency or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome mods and immunosuppression or chemoradiotherapy were correlated with the occurrence of crbsi within 14 days of cvc indwelling table 2 . apache ii score 20 and 3 types of underlying diseases were independent risk factors of crbsi occurring within 14 days of cvc indwelling table 3 . the duration of cvc indwelling until crbsi occurrence is shown in table 4 . femoral cvc showed the shortest time to crbsi onset 14.25.1 days followed by internal jugular cvc 20.98.0 and subclavian cvc 33.83.9 all p0.05 . the major treatment for patients with crbsi was cvc removal and the use of effective antibiotics . the aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical characteristics treatment and prognosis of crbsi in the intensive care unit icu in a chinese center as well as the risk factors for early crbsi . among the 73 crbsi patients enrolled in the present study the major risk factors included advanced age long term catheter indwelling parenteral nutrition diabetes and apache ii score 23 and 3 types of underlying diseases . multivariate analysis showed that an acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii apache ii score 20 and 3 types of underlying diseases were independent factors associated with crbsi occurring within 14 days of cvc indwelling . the prolongation of catheterization by one day was reported to be associated with a 1.8fold increased risk of crbsi . early crbsi may have serious implications for the patients since it can interfere with patient treatment . the results of the present study showed that poor patient condition indicated by the apache ii score and high number of disease types were independently associated with an early crbsi onset . therefore the prevention of crbsi should be for a priority in critically ill patients with complicated diseases . accordingly a previous study showed that the mortality rate due to crbsi in the icu was 28.1 in critically ill patients . in this chinese center critically ill patients in the icu should be particularly monitored for the appearance of crbsi .", " intriguing studies are currently exploring new methods to engage biomolecular targets with high affinity and specificity including the generation of multivalent and heterobifunctional constructs . although these types of compounds fall outside the molecular weight range of typical drug compounds 5003000 da increasing interest in developing new chemical entities that can modulate biomolecular targets in novel ways and address selectivity requirements are emerging . to date there have been only limited examples evaluating the potential for targeting the androgen receptor ar with steroidal conjugates . the ar is an important drug target for treatment of prostate cancer and has been the subject of research for several decades . a large number of bioactive compounds targeting ar have been identified via screening efforts . in this review we begin by providing a rationale for continued studies in prostate cancer pharmacology targeting the ar . the crystal structure of the ar lbd bound to native ligand dht reveals the amino acid residues critical for maintaining high binding affinity figure 1c . mutagenesis of arg752 has been shown to compromise binding affinity suggesting the importance of this interaction for achieving high affinity . mutagenesis of asn705 and thr877 have also resulted in reduced binding affinity and specificity establishing their importance to maintaining high affinity . anti androgens compete with dht for binding to ar thus inhibiting ar transactivation through a variety of mechanisms including disruption of nuclear localization interruption of dna binding and interference with coactivator recruitment . ar have been identified via chemical screening efforts and include compounds that act on the af2 figure 3b or bf3 site figure 3c on ar to regulate its activity . the development of noncompetitive modulators that do not compete against dht for ligand binding could circumvent drug resistance in ar pharmacology . in the future it may be important to utilize structure based design to generate more potent af2 or bf3 inhibitors . additionally drug resistance has been proposed to arise from constitutively active ar splice variants lacking the ar ligand binding domain . below we describe different strategies that have been used to target ar with steroid conjugates along with preliminary evaluation of their potential applications in ar pharmacology . by use of conjugates dubbed proteolysis targeting chimeric molecules protacs the first steroid conjugate to selectively induce ar degradation was developed . a significant decrease in ar protein level proteolysis targeting chimeric molecules protacs for ar a synthesis of protac5 b chemical structure of protac aa c chemical structure of small molecule e3 recognition element left and cocrystal structure of small molecule e3 recognition element blue sticks and e3 orange surface rendered right pdb code 3zrc . current efforts have focused on developing more druglike protac molecules and the recent discovery of the first small molecule targeting e3 figure 4c with an ic50 value of 4.1 m . in the future we may begin to see small molecule protacs targeting ar which may include for example enzalutamide tethered to similar small molecules that are capable of recruiting e3 . in the future research efforts may focus on generating stable linkages between the targeting moiety and the iap recognition element or altering linker lengths to optimize activity of sniper conjugates against various protein targets . importantly the presence of the targeting moiety in the cis conjugate relative to control compounds lacking steroid moieties led to significant structural effects on dna . demonstration that coadministration of a competitive ligand such as dht abrogates the activity of the metallo conjugate would further support the hypothesis that targeting is mediated specifically through binding to ar . the alkylating agent n n bis2chloroethylaniline was linked to a steroid hormone that targets ar allowing the conjugate to simultaneously bind ar and dna . utilizing peptoids as a versatile chemical platform the kirshenbaum lab designed multivalent ethisterone conjugates to specifically target the ar ldb and modulate ar activity via different mechanisms of action . mono di and trivalent conjugates 13 and a cyclic divalent conjugate 7 did not compete for ar binding . importantly cytotoxic effects of conjugates 6 and 7 were not observed in cell lines that do not express ar pc3 and hek293 cells establishing that conjugates selectively target ar . intriguingly conjugate 6 and 7 share extensive chemical similarities indicating that the disposition of the ligand presentation on the scaffolds can exert a significant influence on the mechanism of action . generation of peptidomimetic conjugates capable of antagonizing ar via distinct mechanisms of action could circumvent drug resistance in ar pharmacology . using high resolution structural information the first steroidal constructs aimed toward targeting the er dimer initial studies focused on developing a correlation between linker length and binding affinity . the authors concluded that bivalent conjugates incorporating a 35 linker were most suitable for enhancing er binding affinity . bivalent agonist conjugates displayed weak binding affinity presumably due to burial of the hydrophilic linker within the protein interior . in contrast it was determined that antagonist conjugates incorporating a 14.4 linker induced an intramolecular binding event i.e. a critical objective from a molecular design approach is the ability to induce different er conformations that are dependent upon ligand binding . an open question is whether structure based design can be utilized to generate heterobifunctional conjugates that target two distinct binding sites on ar i.e. over the past decade targeting canonical or membrane associated ar with heterobifunctional or multivalent constructs displaying anti androgen drug ligands has emerged as a potential family of therapeutics . these compound classes hold great promise as effective therapeutic agents due to their ability to modulate ar activity through unique mechanisms of action . because of the large number of reports we highlight only a few representative examples of promising strategies that have been used to target ar with nonsteroidal conjugates . by conjugating histone deacetylase inhibitors to nonsteroidal anti androgen ligands selective modulation of ar activity at concentrations lower than clinical anti androgens was achieved . these results introduce a novel method to antagonize the ar and pave the way for next generation therapeutics . nonsteroidal conjugates targeting ar a chemical structure of heterobifunctional conjugate displaying histone deacetylase inhibitor linked to a nonsteroidal antiandrogen ligand b chemical structure of heterobifunctional conjugate displaying doxorubicin linked to a nonsteroidal antiandrogen ligand c schematic depiction of a multivalent gold nanoparticle displaying nonsteroidal antiandrogen ligands that target membrane associated ar . the anti androgen conjugate successfully delivered the doxorubicin formaldehyde schiff base to cells overexpressing ar highlighting the ability of this approach to enhance selectivity by releasing the pharmacophore in prostate cancer cells . lastly the el sayed lab introduced the first nonsteroidal multivalent conjugates that selectively target membrane associated ar figure 12c . there is a growing appreciation for the design of potent and selective therapeutic agents targeting the ar for prostate cancer patients . the studies highlighted in this review indicate how new chemical entities are being designed to engage ar with high potency . these molecular architectures have been demonstrated to elicit potent biological responses and more importantly target the ar in novel ways . more importantly heterobifunctional displays will likely be designed to target two distinct binding sites on ar enhancing potency and establishing new modes of ar antagonism .", " prehospital 12lead ecgs are now being performed and transmitted to eds to save precious time in diagnosis . the acquisition of a 12lead ecg is an important step to assess the cardiac status in routine and emergency situations . accurate ecg measurements are essential for diagnostic purposes as well as serial comparison to evaluate changes in cardiac status and help in the prediction of future events . in clinical practice the relevance of the ecg depends upon its reproducibility in an individual . with all of these points in mind the application of single lead electrodes to the torso for standard 12lead ecg acquisition takes time . the person performing the 12lead ecg need only to reach out for one single item to be applied to the patient s torso instead of six separate pieces of items as in the traditional case . the v quick patch has the potential to be used anywhere and in any setting where a 12lead ecg is carried out . this study will assess the time required to obtain a 12lead ecg using the v quick patch system versus the standard single electrode systemthe agreement between the 12lead ecgs acquired by both techniques as assessed by two assessors the time required to obtain a 12lead ecg using the v quick patch system versus the standard single electrode system the agreement between the 12lead ecgs acquired by both techniques as assessed by two assessors the null hypothesis would be that there is no difference between the times taken and the level of agreement or quality of the ecgs acquired by the two different techniques . electrodes were placed in the routine standard positions for the single electrode 12lead ecg . following the removal of the standard electrodes the v quick template was attached to the praecordium for the acquisition of the next 12lead ecg . this was done using their unique identification number in and if this number ended with an even digit they would have the v quick technique ecg performed first . in the collection of data some of the information gathered included bra cup size for ladies this was thought to be a good subjective assessment of breast size and volumeshirt size for men this would give an approximate indication of the shoulder widthdistance

analysed using student s t test . the same results were also noted for the standard method it was faster to acquire the 12lead ecg by the standard method in male volunteers . table 3comparison between

acquired by the two different techniques intra assessor agreement and when each ecg was read by the two assessors separately inter assessor agreement . often ecgs are acquired by ecg technicians or nurses who over the years have become very versatile and familiar with the importance of accurate lead placement according to the thoracic landmarks . the v quick technique showed a favourable result from this study in terms of timing as well as agreement with the standard 12lead ecg in 300 normal volunteers . however having said that the onus will still lie with the operator carrying out the ecg to strive for the most accurate placement . we will in future consider a trial using the v quick system in all patients who present to the ed and also the prehospital group of patients requiring a 12lead ecg . in this study of 300 male and female volunteers the v quick patch system was proved to be significantly faster than the single electrode standard 12lead system for the acquisition of electrocardiograms ecgs .", " therefore clinical features of phrynoderma and its association with nutritional deficiency signs were studied to elucidate the relationship between phrynoderma and nutritional status of patients . all patients with phrynoderma examined by the investigator irrespective of age and gender were included in the study . in the present study thus increased nutritional demand during childhood and lactation and the lack of good nutrition due to low socioeconomic status may be responsible for occurrence of phrynoderma in these patients . the proportion of phrynoderma cases in the present study is less compared to other studies where it was found to be 1.3 3 and 5 . the decline in the proportion of phrynoderma patients over the past few decades therefore nutrition seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of phrynoderma . the absence of the disease in siblings who are also taking the same diet suggests the role of other factors in the manifestation of phrynoderma . although the occurrence of phrynoderma has been related to nutritional status of the patient in the present study the signs and symptoms of nutritional deficiency the ocular manifestations of vit a deficiency in patients with phrynoderma have been reported to be 5 . it has also been demonstrated that the incidence of phrynoderma is less where the prevalence of signs of vit a deficiency is high and vice versa . diet survey and serum vit a levels in apparently healthy phrynoderma patients and normal controls revealed no statistically significant difference between the two groups . the vit a deficiency as a cause of phrynoderma was largely based on the therapeutic response to cod liver oil which was considered to be a source of vit a. however later it has also been demonstrated as a source of efa . however with the available literature and our findings it can be hypothesized that phrynoderma may be a multifactorial disease involving multiple nutrients local factors like pressure and friction and environmental factors manifesting in the setting of increased nutritional demand . further prospective case control studies investigating the levels of vit b complex vit a vit e and efa in the blood and skin and also in relation to the treatment are required to delineate the exact pathogenesis of phrynoderma .", " we tried to perform colonoscopy but failed due to poor bowel preparation and fresh blood . we found fresh blood throughout the entire colon and terminal ileum but could not find the bleeding focus . for evaluation of other small bowel lesions we performed capsule endoscopy but could not find any abnormal lesion except the previously placed hemoclips fig . on the day of admission she underwent egd and colonoscopy but we could not find the bleeding focus . she then underwent abdominal ct but there was no specific lesion in the gi tract suspicious for bleeding . we recommended enteroscopy for evaluation of the obscure bleeding focus but she refused because her melena ceased . we found a fresh blood clot adherent on the mucosa of proximal ileum and after saline irrigation we detected the active bleeding focus at a narrow point of normal appearing mucosa fig . we tried to perform colonoscopy but failed due to poor bowel preparation and fresh blood . we found fresh blood throughout the entire colon and terminal ileum but could not find the bleeding focus . for evaluation of other small bowel lesions we performed capsule endoscopy but could not find any abnormal lesion except the previously placed hemoclips fig . on the day of admission she underwent egd and colonoscopy but we could not find the bleeding focus . she then underwent abdominal ct but there was no specific lesion in the gi tract suspicious for bleeding . we recommended enteroscopy for evaluation of the obscure bleeding focus but she refused because her melena ceased . since the widespread availability of endoscopic or angiographic treatment surgery will play a minor role and often be left as the last therapeutic option for rebleeding lesions or after failed nonsurgical treatment.16 in summary for the appropriate evaluation of small bowel bleeding an aggressive multidisciplinary approach such as radiologic intervention enteroscopy and surgery should be performed .", " obesity stigma and negative stereotypes of obese people are widespread and damaging to the health dignity human rights and quality of life of obese individuals . standard media and biomedical depictions of obese individuals contribute to this stigmatization by positing that obesity incidence is nearly entirely dependent on individualistic actions . furthermore obese individuals may occupy numerous intersecting social roles and identities based on their gender class race and other social positions . despite the oft reported inefficacy of weight loss dieting public health interventions may be unsuccessful due to a narrow focus on weight loss an overly simplistic notion of how obese individuals live experience their bodies the contexts they inhabit and the opportunities available to them in seeking wellness happiness and a full life . even within the expanding fields of critical obesity research as warin and gunson note the compiling of actual obese people s experiences and perspectives has been limited . biomedical research nearly invariably posits obesity as a health crisis despite evidence that obese individuals may be metabolically healthy overweight people live longer than normal weight persons as do obese individuals in chronic disease populations and fit obese persons compared to unfit normal weight persons 2 6 . in examining clinician perspectives on obesity what appears to be essential therefore is the establishment of trusting and respectful relationships between clinicians and their obese patients in designing interventions for obese persons . a greater understanding of clinicians and obese patients health perspectives perceptions and priorities over the life course is paramount for achieving these aims . a greater awareness of the stigma obese individuals encounter in day to day life as well as in the healthcare system is of particular importance to improve health and quality of life . the pervasiveness of obesity stigma in health care settings is of particular importance for obese individuals health and public health planning 7 8 . social scientists could explore these issues and seek to deploy an in depth exploratory perspective from obese individuals own emic perspective . the depiction of obesity in biomedical media and other popular accounts contributes to the manifestation and degree of obesity stigma present among the public . these portrayals may inadvertently silence the source most important to understanding the public health programming needs of obese individuals that is obese individuals themselves by presenting a homogenizing and blaming view of such individuals lifestyles and experiences . bringing forth obese individuals perspectives and learning from their embodied knowledge through multidisciplinary research may enhance public health programming efforts . this depiction contributes to stigmatizing attitudes toward obese individuals who come to be viewed as embodying a remediable social and health burden borne in part by others . while environmental risks for obesity are acknowledged individuals are assumed to willingly incur these risks and thus still be largely culpable for their body size and worthy of disapprobation . rather than castigating obese individuals for their size qualitative social science researchers may be in a position to rewrite common stereotypical assumptions of obese individuals lives by working collaboratively to better understand the health and experiences of an often maligned group and addressing the health concerns most relevant to them . it has been suggested that stigma may serve as a motivator for weight loss among obese individuals 1 38 . one method of managing stigma utilized by these individuals who varied in their acceptance of obesity as a discredited state involved the accounts they related concerning their weight issues 56 58 . the literature thus suggests that obese individuals experience substantial stigmatization and exist in an environment saturated with nonproblematized information concerning the health risks of excess weight . this information is often presented in a manner that assumes control for health resides in the individual the possibility of health and obesity are mutually exclusive and that achieving wellness constitutes a moral imperative . as evidence suggests that obese individuals may be healthy obese individuals may not absorb popular obesity related messaging based on their own somatic signaling or knowledge of their lifestyles . in crafting public health messaging programs and policies is considering the potentially multifaceted effects of stigma on obese individuals lives 59 60 . these data on obese people s perspectives and health will add to the rich work conducted in critical obesity and fat studies theoretical understandings of the body and qualitative research done on discursive bodily and health perspectives of individuals of all sizes for example 2 32 3648 5658 6268 . furthermore haes advocates are critical of the overestimation of excess weight s effects on morbidity and mortality the discounting of the existence of healthy obese individuals and the ethics of promoting weight loss given its low levels of success and possible harms . studies critiquing the biological and epidemiological underpinnings of the prevailing view of obesity as a major health concern and the product of individual behavior have been published . a variety of issues have been raised by these scholars and include the use of terms such as epidemic or crisis in referring to obesity the moralization of a presumed health issue and resultant ethical and stigmatizing implications of interventions and messaging and the dominant obesity discourse s effects on individuals bodily understandings 2 32 3648 5658 6268 . while in the contemporary social climate obese individuals are often stigmatized obese individuals and their allies have also marshaled resistance to dominant obesity messaging . further ethnography on obese individuals with a focus on health and with applied aims would be immeasurably useful to health care providers public health professionals and the general public of all sizes . in documenting the manner in which obese individuals live the choices they make their priorities in wellness and quality of life their contributions to society and their potential experiences with others biases applied social scientists could put a human face on obesity and work toward producing a positive life affirming and inclusive public health focused on reducing stigma and blame and helping all people achieve a high quality of life . applied social science can enhance obese individuals quality of life by providing a greater understanding and problematization of taken for granted assumptions regarding obese individuals health lives and lifestyles . emic understandings of obese individuals lives through ethnography or similar in depth research methods could lead to a less stigmatizing more healthful view of how obese individuals navigate their everyday lives this more in depth understanding may contribute invaluably to public health approaches in the future . this perspective would help counter potentially traumatic past experiences of dieting or healthcare discrimination produce a more patient centered approach more congruent to obese individuals lives and wishes and help establish trusting relationships and bonds between obese individuals health care providers and public health officials . seeking to conduct and disseminate such research this may be particularly evident in trying to demonstrate its value to those largely unaware of obesity stigma s pervasiveness its effects or who have internalized negative stereotypes of obese persons . this would allow policy makers to learn from patients experiences and desires to rewrite public health messaging programs and clinical guidelines to better address obese persons needs and priorities in terms of healthcare system allocation address systemic and interpersonal discrimination and establish weight industry regulations more in keeping with respect for consumers and truth in advertising . within this environment exposure to such messaging renders obese individuals as a population worthy of special consideration in planning public health programs to avoid reinforcing demeaning stereotypes . what are lacking despite this oppressive focus on obesity are the perspectives of obese individuals themselves concerning their health goals wishes and quality of life .", " this paper was among the first to adopt a machine learning approach to further increase the accuracy of cd patient identification based on a combination of pathological and clinical metrics . automatically selecting features out of v6 using a feature selection algorithm resulted in the variable set 8 v8 table 1 . for expert knowledge driven feature selection we identified a list of nine key phrases described by clinicians as commonly used in pathology reports as indicators of high risk cd . it has been found useful in several recent classification and information retrieval studies using medical documents . therefore we only chose the three most representative classifiers from four major categories to experiment with in this paper . in each category previous studies on classifying medical documents showed that the performance variation among different models could be relatively small within the category compared with across the categories . selected classification models for experiments there are different ways to configure a classifier . for each one of the twelve classification models table 2 we also experimented with the use of the eight different variable configurations v1v8 table 1 to find the best variable configuration to produce the best possible classifier . the classification model with the best performance overview of the architectural design of experiments feature selection or variable selection is critical for optimizing a classification model . the feature selection model we used implemented a correlation based feature evaluation model called cfssubseteval . the cfssubseteval feature evaluation model ranks the features based on their correlation with the class while minimizing the redundancy of variables . for expert knowledge driven feature selection we identified a list of nine key phrases described by clinicians as commonly

ranks the features based on their correlation with the class while minimizing the redundancy of variables . statistics of the best classification models for each variable configuration among experiments using single category of variables experiment 2 and 48 nave bayes model based on automatically selected n gram features generated the best results auc of 0.92 kappa of 0.73 and f1 of 0.90 which was also the overall second best performing model . our machine learning approach could quickly and effectively choose the most relevant variables from various clinical sources for automated cd classification . the number of laboratories done was as effective as the actual lab results reported in our case for cd classification auc of 0.71 vs. 0.83 . in addition our results added further evidence to previous studies that nave bayes model generated the most accurate results even if only pathology report features were used kappa of 0.73 f1 of 0.90 and auc of 0.92 . although new to the task of cd classification feature selection methods have been found widely used in other disease classification studies including alzheimer s disease and asthma . the classification accuracy was over 90 of correctness f1 in our case while it greatly eliminated the need of often time consuming process of manual review . first since the cd classification task was performed on a subset of patients prescreened by icd9 code rather than on the general patient population the performance of final classification results may depend on the accuracy of initial icd9 assignment . second although feature selection method was found to be critical in yielding high performance we have not conducted systematic experiments with all possible feature selection methods provided in the weka machine learning system . since the cd classification task was performed on a subset of patients prescreened by icd9 code rather than on the general patient population the performance of final classification results

recent studies have demonstrated the co infection of vaginal pathogenic organisms in pap tests 2 9 10 . this study aimed to investigate the prevalence of pathogenic vaginal microorganisms and the presence of inflammation in pap smear among an iranian women sample and to evaluate the possible co infection of these organisms . the frequency of pathogenic vaginal microorganisms and inflammation among pap smear samples among all samples bv the presence of clue cells was the most common pathogenic microorganism which was seen in 91 samples 17.2 followed by vc n 56 10.6 . inflammation was detected in 76 n 402 of pap smears in which 80.1 n 322 were reported among reproductive age women . in our study the prevalence of bv among pap smear specimens of women living in tehran was 17 which is similar to azargoon s study 16 on a population in semnan another city in center of iran 3 but it had a higher rate in hamadan a western city of iran and has been reported 28.5 11 . in our study we found no significant association between bv and tv in conventional pap smear sampling which might be because of low prevalence of tv in our samples . several studies investigated the association between infection and existence of inflammation in cervical smears 2023 . some of them found that inflammation on pap smear had a relatively low predictive value for the presence of infection 21 . in contrast others indicated a significant association between inflammatory smear and reproductive tract infections 22 24 . they discovered that the prevalence of infection with chlamydia trachomatis candida bacteroides and gardnerella vaginalis was higher in the inflammatory smear group . based on our results inflammation reported in the pap smears demands the evaluation for vc and its proper treatment .", " human brucellosis is transmitted by inhalation animal contact and the consumption of dairy products and undercooked meat products . tests carried out in the us on the carcasses of bovine and swine that were slaughtered because infected revealed that 1.2 of the bovine carcasses and 3.5 of the swine carcasses were contaminated by brucella spp . in a similar study conducted in india on 100 carcasses of goats two of the 700 neck muscle samples analysed tested positive for brucella melitensis randhawa and karla 1970 . in orderto evaluate the prevalence of contamination of meats and to assess the risk of infection for consumers and professionally exposed workers an investigation on 307 carcasses of bovines sheep and goats that were slaughtered because they had resulted positive on serological testing for brucella spp . the study lasted 12 months and was carried out in 10 abattoirs in southern italy where brucellosis infection is still widespread on cattle sheep and goat farms . these animals came from 24 different farms and were slaughtered because they had proved positive on serological tests for brucella spp . in accordance with italian law and with the aim of eradicating brucellosis in cattle sheep and goats the carcasses of infected animals may be freely marketed if the outcome of post slaughter examination is favourable while all the internal organs and the udders must be destroyed . the 25 carcasses found to be contaminated with brucella spp . the bacteriological tests carried out on the organs of all 307 animals examined allowed isolating brucella spp . 44 the typing analysis allows detecting type 3 brucella abortus in the cattle organs and type 3 brucella melitensis in the sheep and goats organs . the organs specifically the lymph nodes from all the carcasses that had tested positive on pcr on swabs also proved positive on bacteriological testing for type 3 brucella abortus the bovine carcass and for type 3 brucella melitensis the sheep and goat carcasses . the meat of animals slaughtered due to brucella spp . contamination by brucella spp . the only brucella serotypes isolated from the organs were type 3 brucella abortus in cattle and type 3 brucella melitensis in sheep and goats . 2014 thus the environments and facilities of slaughterhouses may also be severely contaminated thereby constituting a risk of contagion for staff involved in butchery and meat handling and a risk of contamination of the carcasses of other animals that are not infected by brucellosis . pcr testing of swab samples taken from the carcasses of animals that had tested positive for brucella proved to be useful . nevertheless the results of the present study show that the carcasses and consequently the meat of animals positive for brucellosis may be contaminated by brucella spp .", " polychondritis is known as a rare complication of bd and no case of bd combined with polychondritis had been reported on until firestein et al . reported on five patients with both bd and relapsing polychondritis rp in 19852 . we recently experienced a case of a 40year old male patient with both bd and polychondritis and we report herein on this unusual case along with a review of the literature . in our patient bd was diagnosed based upon the recurrent oral and genital ulcers the skin vasculitis the arthritis and the past history of uveitis . this suggests that the development of polychondritis may have been associated with bd in our case . although cases of bd combined with polychondritis have rarely been reported bd and polychondritis do not seem to be separate entities . these similarities between the clinical manifestations of bd and rp imply that there seems to be something in common for the pathogenesis of bd and polychondritis . although there have been only a few reports about polychondritis combined with bd we think this combination of diseases might have been overlooked so far and closer scrutiny would reveal more cases

monocytes . in the present study we provide evidence that exendin4 a glp1 receptor agonist prevents the progression of atherosclerosis in apoe mice without major effects on metabolic parameters . our data suggest that exendin4 markedly reduced the accumulation of monocytes macrophages in the vascular wall at least in part by suppressing the inflammatory response in macrophages through the activation of the camp pka pathway . the results showed that the exendin4 decreased monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells in two nondiabetic mice c57bl6 and apoe mice . in both mouse strains exendin4 reduced glucose level during ipgtt however because the two strains are nondiabetic the effect of exendin4 on glucose level should play only a minor effect on its antiatherosclerogenetic properties . on the other hand we confirmed in the present study the direct anti inflammatory effect of glp1 on monocytes macrophages . indeed treatment with exendin4 at concentrations observed during treatment of humans 2728 reduced the expression of inflammatory mediators tnf and mcp1 in activated macrophages . thus in addition to the effect of glp1 on endothelial cells its effect on monocytes macrophages may also have a major impact on the attenuation of atherosclerosis . using adenylate cyclase inhibitor and activator we also demonstrated in this study that stimulation of camp by exendin4 is critical for the attenuated production of proinflammatory mediators from macrophages . these data suggest that exendin4 regulates inflammatory response of macrophages via the camp pka pathway which inhibits proinflammatory cytokine production as reported recently 3536 . our results showed a potential suppressive effect of exendin4 on the surface expression of cd11b on human monocytes . on the other hand we demonstrated that exendin4 decreased the expression of icam1 which interacts with cd11b on monocytes in apoe mice . however additional experiments are required to clarify the mechanism of exendin4induced inhibition of cd11b expression . in conclusion our data suggest that glp1 receptor activation significantly reduced the accumulation of monocytes macrophages in the vascular wall and eventually inhibited atherosclerogenesis by regulating inflammation in macrophages via the camp pka pathway and the integrin related gene expression on monocytes .", " in this study with large population based data from shanghai the biggest city in china and singapore a city country in southeast asia with majority of the residents being descendents of immigrants from south china we aimed to examine the independent contributions of physical and cognitive health to disability in chinese older adults and explore the potential influences of environment . the ssadd was conducted in 1987 based on a probability sample of 5055 community dwelling chinese older adults from jingan district of shanghai city . for the present analysis we extracted the following variables from the databases age sex functional status chronic diseases self rated health status and mmse total score . multiple logistic regressions were used to examine the relationship between health factors and disability and the influence from environment . in analysis based on the combined sample age sex number of chronic diseases self rated health status mmse total score and environment singapore versus shanghai were included in the regression model . however the shanghai participants were also older had more chronic diseases had poorer self rated health status and obtained lower mmse total score as compared to their singapore counterparts table 1 . in multiple logistic model based on the combined sample number of chronic diseases self rated health status mmse total score and environment the odds ratio was 1.35 95 ci 1.221.50 for number of chronic diseases 2.85 95 ci 2.363.43 for self rated health status continuous 0.89 95 ci 0.850.94 for mmse total score and 0.68 95 ci 0.480.96 for environment singapore versus shanghai respectively . for example in the shanghai sample one point increase on the 4point self rated health status scale was associated with 3.13 times 95 ci 2.553.85 higher odds of having disability while the odds ratio was only 1.73 95 ci 1.072.81 in the singapore sample . based on data from two population based studies we found that the number of chronic diseases self rated health status cognitive function and unmeasured environment factors represented by study sample were significantly associated with functional disability among chinese older adults . participants in the singapore sample were 32 less likely to have disability compared with participants in the shanghai sample .", " proper design of a ligand targeted chemotherapeutic agent requires i selection of a high affinity ligand with good selectivity for a cancer enriched receptor ii identification of a therapeutic agent with sufficient potency to kill cancer cells when captured by a cancer specific receptor and iii construction of a linker that will enable delivery and release of the attached drug preferentially within the targeted cells . to determine the cytotoxicity and targeting specificity of the crl l1davbh conjugate we incubated crl l1davbh free davbh and nontargeted l1davbh with cck2r transfected hek 293 cells for 2 h followed by incubation of the cells in drug free medium for 66 h. cell viability was then measured via incorporation of h thymidine . importantly crl by itself was found to show no cytotoxicity toward hek 293cck2r cells si figure 8 demonstrating that the aforementioned cytotoxicity was due to the targeted therapeutic agent rather than obstruction of cck2r by crl . the cytotoxicity of free davbh circles the nontargeted l1davbh triangles and the targeted crl l1davbh squares conjugates in hek 293 cells transfected with cck2r when pulsed for 2 h at 37 c washed with culture medium three times and then incubated for an additional 66 h. cells were incubated with h thymidine for 4 h and washed three times . as shown in figure 3a crl l1davbh was found to markedly delay tumor growth but not lead to complete tumor eradication . as expected the nontargeted l1davbh exerted little impact on tumor growth demonstrating the critical role of ligand targeting on crl l1davbh efficacy figure 3a . arrows show the abundance of cancer cells in panel a and a reduced number of cancer cells in panel b. because complete tumor remission was not achieved at a dose of 2 g kg with crl l1davbh we elected to develop a more potent cck2r targeted conjugate . similarly the targeted crl l1tubbh conjugate yielded an ic50 of 2 nm whereas nontargeted l1tubbh displayed the anticipated significant drop in potency ic50 of 310 nm due to its membrane impermeability and lack of targeting . to ensure that the cytotoxicity of crl l1tubbh was receptor mediated cells were incubated with crl l1tubbh in the presence of 100fold excess crl l1 . the cytotoxicity of free tubbh circles the nontargeted l1tubbh triangles the targeted crl l1tubbh squares and the targeted crl l1tubbh in the presence of 100fold greater concentration competing crl l1 diamonds conjugates in hek 293 cells transfected with cck2r when pulsed for 2 h at 37 c washed with culture medium three times and then incubated for an additional 66 h. cells were incubated with h thymidine for 4 h and washed three times . to determine the efficacy of crl l1tubbh in vivo we followed the same treatment regimen used for davbh conjugates except that tubbh conjugates were injected intravenously . crl l1tubbh showed efficient antitumor activity eliminating all detectable malignant lesions from all five mice figure 6a and prolonged survival si figure 9 . as expected nontargeted l1tubbh showed no difference from the saline treated control group when an identical concentration as that of the crl l1tubbh targeted conjugate was tested . moreover when crl l1tubbh was competed with 100fold excess of crl l1 the antitumor effect of the targeted tubbh was negated figure 6a . this indicates that the antitumor activity observed in the crl l1tubbh group was entirely receptor mediated . finally to more thoroughly establish the necessity of receptor mediated targeting for crl l1tubbh efficacy the targeted conjugate was tested using the same protocol in a cck2r negative kb xenograft model . in vitro crl l1tubbh conjugate yielded an ic50 value of 269 nm si figure 9 similar to the ic50 values observed with the nontargeted and competed targeted conjugates in the cck2r expressing hek cells . on the basis of literature demonstrating overexpression of cck2r in gastrointestinal stromal tumors and colon stomach esophageal and pancreatic cancers the crl conjugates described in this paper should have the potential to address this deficiency . one of the more interesting results to emerge from this study was the high specificity displayed by both crl l1davbh and crl l1tubbh for cck2r expressing cancer cells . cck2r dependent binding of crl l1davbh and crl l1tubbh was established by the absence of toxicity when i crl was deleted ii conjugate binding was competed with excess ligand or iii cck2r was absent from the targeted cancer cell . in the case of linking crl to davbh and tubbh the insertion of a bulky water soluble linker between the ligand and drug converted an otherwise nonspecific drug conjugate into a highly receptor targeted drug conjugate at physiologically relevant concentrations . our crl tubbh conjugates were also tested against xenograft tumors similar to those exposed to the davbh conjugates except an additional treatment group was included where crl l1tubbh was competed with excess crl l1 . similar to the davbh conjugates the nontargeted l1tubbh conjugate did not appear to have any effect on tumor growth . the lack of efficacy of l1conjugated cytotoxic compounds in vivo is most likely due to the hydrophilic linker which does not allow for the cytotoxic compound to readily diffuse through the cell membrane whereas the targeted crl l1davbh and crl l1tubbh both showed efficacy in vivo . when the more potent crl l1tubbh conjugate was tested not only do it halt tumor growth but it even regressed the tumor to an indistinguishable level . importantly the crl l1tubbh treatment group that was competed with crl l1 showed no effect on inhibiting tumor growth similar to both the vehicle control and the nontargeted conjugate . to further assess the necessity of receptor mediated targeting we tested xenografts of the receptor negative kb cell line with the targeted crl l1tubbh conjugate .", " often a new physics faculty member is faced with the duty of renovating the introductory physics labs . we will provide a list of experiments

represents an opportune target for managing blood glucose . a detailed summary of clinical findings has recently been published.55 the mechanism of action of sglt2 inhibitors predicts a beneficial effect but the long term glucose lowering capacity in a clinical setting may not impart significant reductions in hba1c . nevertheless patients who achieve moderate glycemic control may be exposed to clinically relevant post prandial glucose excursions that can impart disproportionate effects on hba1c and possibly the morbidity and mortality associated with t2dm.56 in such a patient population sglt2 inhibitors might attenuate the impact of post prandial glucose spikes . treatments targeting post prandial glucose levels provide little more than modest improvements in hba1c with little evidence of long term outcome benefits for patients.57 as sglt2 may be responsible for as much as 90 of glucose reabsorption by the kidney there is the clinical potential for as much as 160 g of glucose to be excreted each day following effective sglt2 inhibition.23 however it appears that the actual glucose loss achieved in clinical studies is only about half that predicted.38 it is not clear whether this is a consequence of compensating mechanisms undertaking tubular reabsorption or incomplete inhibition of the transporter . clearly compared with less specific molecules the potential for it is also unlikely that sglt2 inhibitors will induce hypoglycemia since when plasma glucose levels are low the amount of glucose excreted will also be low.59 this prediction appears to be confirmed by clinical studies reported thus far which show no apparent increases in hypoglycemic episodes with sglt2 inhibitors.5060 even when sglt2 is blocked completely a degree of renal glucose recovery is maintained via the relatively unhindered sglt1 transporter . increased glucose content in the urine following sglt2 inhibition will likely serve to increase urinary flow as a consequence of the osmotic diuretic effect in the lumen of the nephron . the mechanism of action of sglt2 inhibitors predicts a beneficial effect but the long term glucose lowering capacity in a clinical setting may not impart significant reductions in hba1c . nevertheless patients who achieve moderate glycemic control may be exposed to clinically relevant post prandial glucose excursions that can impart disproportionate effects on hba1c and possibly the morbidity and mortality associated with t2dm.56 in such a patient population sglt2 inhibitors might attenuate the impact of post prandial glucose spikes . treatments targeting post prandial glucose levels provide little more than modest improvements in hba1c with little evidence of long term outcome benefits for patients.57 as sglt2 may be

increased glucose content in the urine following sglt2 inhibition will likely serve to increase urinary flow as a consequence of the osmotic diuretic effect in the lumen of the nephron . despite the modest effect on hba1c predicted for sglt2 inhibitors the introduction of a novel means of reducing hyperglycemia increases the treatment options available to physicians for a disease that frequently requires the use of multiple agents to achieve control targets.57 the expected favorable safety profile and insulin independent mechanism of action appear to support the use of sglt2 inhibitors in combination with other antidiabetic drugs . the insulin independent action of sglt2 inhibitors suggests potential for a synergistic effect in such scenarios . the insulin independent action of sglt2 inhibitors also means that they may be of use in type 1 diabetes perhaps as a means of moderating post prandial glucose excursions . by increasing excretion of glucose sglt2 inhibitors offer an opportunity to increase calorie loss in t2 dm patients most of whom are overweight . in a clinical setting it would be easy to overcome any benefits that patients may derive from sglt2 inhibition if they perceived the drug as a means of acclimatized to higher levels of plasma glucose would experience a marked change in appetite with substantial loss of glucose calories.67 one final issue is that for these drugs to work they need to be delivered to the epithelial luminal surface of the nephron requiring them to be cleared by the glomerulus . with sglt2 inhibitors introducing an alternative means of managing glucose we gain a further treatment option that may increase our ability to control t2 dm .", " the absence of df testing may have medico legal implications whether a device fails to

df test 985.9 . to the best of our knowledge the nordic icd trial is the first prospective randomized trial which investigated the effect of df testing on the actual fse during follow up as the single primary end point . the observed lower rate of arrhythmic death for patients without df testing 0.2 vs. 0.9 corresponds to the sudden cardiac death rate reported in another trial 0.9 and 1.2 in patients without and with df testing during a similar follow up period . in the nordic icd and the simple trials a higher raw shock efficacy was observed in the group without df vs. with df testing nordic icd 93.6 vs. 85.3 and simple 92.0 vs. 88.5 . the two types of adverse events that were increased in patients with df testing were intra operative hypotension 1.7 vs. 0.0 p 0.004 and lead related complications 3.9 vs. 2.8 p 0.311 . both the nordic icd and simple trials showed a trend towards lower procedural complication rates in patients without df testing despite the different definitions and methods used for analysing these events nordic icd 13.9 vs.17.6 p 0.095 simple 5.6 vs. 6.5 p 0.33 . the rates of all cause cardiac and non cardiac mortality were similar between patients with and without df testing which is in agreement with most non randomized trials reported . in accordance with the simple trial no statistical difference in all cause mortality between patients with and without df testing however the annual mortality rates of nordic icd were lower when compared with other large randomized icd trials and also lower than those of the simple trial . the nordic icd trial supports the hypothesis that if 40 j devices are used df testing does not improve df efficacy during follow up . the nordic icd trial is one of two large prospective randomized trials which do not support the routine use of df testing during left sided first time icd implantation .", " incontinent ileocutaneostomy is most commonly used among surgeons and this type of urinary diversion has the greatest chances to be constructed using tissue engineering methods . over the past 65 years the first attempt at artificial urinary conduit construction using tissue engineering methods was performed by drewa in 2007 . five years later two other groups conducted urinary conduit construction on a porcine model . in contrast to previously presented experiments in this study the bladder was removed and both ureters were transplanted to the conduit . acellular matrices were used in 6 animals and scaffolds seeded with urothelial cells were used in 24 rabbits . in this study the bladder was also removed and both ureters were transplanted to the conduit . such complications were not observed when a ureter segment was regenerated using this same scaffolds . in that group all currently performed attempts of experimental artificial urinary conduit construction using tissue engineering techniques are presented in figure 1 . different approaches currently used in experimental urinary conduit construction using tissue engineering techniques . a experiment carried out only on one ureter b two ureters were anastomosed with artificial conduit urinary bladder was removed 21 22 23 . in literature there is still a small number of works describing the use of tissue engineering for urinary conduit construction . all experiments describing the use of tissue engineering in urinary diversion construction conducted so far were evaluated . this shows how little is known about ureter segment regeneration including artificial urinary conduit construction which continues to be an unresolved problem . construction of an artificial urinary conduit without cell seeding makes it the ideal off the shelf product which could be purchased from the pharmacy directly before the surgical procedure . epithelial regeneration should be potentially easier in the case of ureter segment regeneration in which urothelial cells can migrate from two edges compared to urinary conduit . data available in literature gives contrary results about the use of urothelial cells in tissue engineering applications . some studies showed no differences in seeded and unseeded group on the other hand other researches obtained positive results only when scaffold was seeded with urothelial cells 22 23 . the urinary conduit must be constructed from rigid material in order to protect from scaffold occlusion at the site of anastomosis with skin . in vitro isolation and culture of icc lc from the urinary tract has not yet been established but taking into consideration previous works and our experience on urinary conduit construction addition of these cells or coculture of them with smooth muscle cells can potentially accelerate the restoration of peristaltic waves on the reconstructed segment which could prevent development of hydronephrosis . the first attempt at artificial urinary conduit construction using tissue engineering methods was performed by drewa in 2007 . five years later two other groups conducted urinary conduit construction on a porcine model . in contrast to previously presented experiments in this study the bladder was removed and both ureters were transplanted to the conduit . acellular matrices were used in 6 animals and scaffolds seeded with urothelial cells were used in 24 rabbits . in a second group in which plcl scaffold was used in 3 cases constructed conduits were patent at the end of follow up 4 weeks but only in one case intense urine flow without the presence of pus in the urinary tract was observed . such complications were not observed when a ureter segment was regenerated using this same scaffolds . in that group all currently performed attempts of experimental artificial urinary conduit construction using tissue engineering techniques are presented in figure 1 . different approaches currently used in experimental urinary conduit construction using tissue engineering techniques . in literature there is still a

results about the use of urothelial cells in tissue engineering applications . the urinary conduit must be constructed from rigid material in order to protect from scaffold occlusion at the site of anastomosis with skin . in conclusion success in ureter conduit construction using tissue engineering techniques depends on finding the proper scaffold . we believe that implementation of this procedure is possible and urinary conduit should be the first commercially available product in clinical practice constructed using regenerative medicine .", " several studies suggest that hdf may lead to better clinical results than high flux hd hf hd.23 according to a recent survey hdf was started to prevent dialysis complications increase the efficiency of dialysis for uremic accumulates treat dialysis related hypotension and dialysis related amyloidosis and for intractable pruritus restless leg syndrome and arthralgia not related to dialysis related amyloidosis.4 however to date randomized studies have not conclusively supported the superiority of hdf regarding clinical outcomes.57 in addition concerns have been raised about its cost utility8 leading investigators to conduct cost analyses to assess the differential expenditures between the two therapies.9 in a recent editorial vanholder et al concluded that more expensive therapies should be reimbursed only when evidence of their cost utility defined as the ratio of treatment cost to treatment outcome taking into consideration also the quality of life qol is sufficiently robust.10 the cost of hdf per se has decreased in recent years due to 1 increased market penetration and the subsequent economy of scale in the production of equipment and disposables 2 the pressure on health care costs due to the economic crises prevailing since 2008 and 3 the safety and reliability of online method that have reduced demand for microbiological testing and monitoring.1112 furthermore after the publication of the study of canaud et al2 hdf treatment effectiveness has increasingly been understood to be positively associated with the magnitude of the convection volume used resulting in trends toward the application of higher hdf convection volumes than were applied in earlier cost analyses . the aim of this study is to assess the cost effectiveness of hdf compared to hd by a simulation using existing study data . these data facilitate an understanding of whether longer survival and better health related quality of life hrqol are able to offset the possibly higher costs of hdf and thus whether it is worth investing in this more innovative therapy . the analysis comprised a simulation1315 based on results from combined previous observational studies randomized clinical trials and a meta analysis with the following steps 1 estimation of a the survival function of hf hd patients from the membrane permeability outcome study16 dataset and b estimation of the survival function of hdf patients using the risk reduction estimates due to the treatment effect from the meta analysis of mostovaya et al17 even though it includes also studies comparing hdf to low flux hd it was considered the best proxy with respect to other alternative meta analyses available in the literature 2 simulation of the survival of the same sample of patients as if allocated to hf hd or hdf using three state markov models 3 application of state specific hrqol coefficients and differential costs materials testing and consumption of water derived from the literature . the probability of cost effectiveness increased to 50 with a threshold of 7000qaly to 70 with a threshold of 15000qaly and to 81 with the commonly accepted threshold of 40000qaly . this asymptotic value results from the fact that a fraction of the simulations represent cases where the alternative therapy hdf causes higher costs and provided fewer benefits . this means that even with any budget constraint there is some probability that the alternative therapy is not cost effective and the traditional one hf hd is preferred . the same analyses were carried out for the subgroups of 40 50 and 60year old male and female patients table 1 hdf appears to be more cost effective for younger patients . this message is reinforced in figure 4 which shows that a given threshold value is associated to a higher probability of hdf being cost effective for the 40 and 50year old patients than for the 60year old ones . moreover for the 60year old groups there is a probability of around 28 for both females and males that hdf is not cost effective even at extreme values of the threshold . by applying a 0 or a 5 discount rate for both costs and effects 50year old male patient icer decreased to 6676qaly and increased to 6960qaly respectively confirming the robustness of the estimations . previously cost inputs were point estimates whereas now costs vary over the range assessed by lebourg et al.12 the ceac for the subgroup of 50year old male patients shows that 21.5 of the simulations are cost saving figure 6 . hdf seems a little more expensive for instance the icers of the younger patients rise from 5878qaly and 5732qaly to 7748qaly and 7724qaly for female and male patients respectively table 2 . given the commonly accepted threshold of 40000qaly this study demonstrated that compared to hf hd hdf is a cost effective treatment for patients on dialysis . however it has to be mentioned that the same analysis performed on patients treated in montreal canada according to the same protocol yielded different positive results.24 our analysis on the other hand reports that hdf is cost effective with a probability of 81 . the icer estimates show a good value for money but some doubts about the cost effectiveness of hdf over hf hd remain due to the residual 20 probability of costs being higher andor benefits being lower with hdf . this line of reasoning is also shared by mcbrien and manns26 in their commentary of the mazairac study where they argued that hdf is characterized by higher procedural costs and has no proven health benefit . this was the rationale for conducting a value based study incorporating hrqol as a main outcome of hdf versus hf hd . therefore this study recommends prioritizing the research which evaluates the qol related to hdf . this trial was based on incident patients whereas other studies on hdf were mainly performed on prevalent european dialysis patients . this study contributes also to show the scarcity and heterogeneity of data available in the literature that jeopardize the economic evaluation of hdf when compared to hf hd .", " alzheimer s disease ad is the most frequent neurodegenerative disease ferri et al . the neuropathological hallmark of ad is the presence of cortical intracellular neurofibrillary tangles nft and extracellular amyloid a plaques braak and braak 1991 which leads to synapse dysfunction neuronal cell loss and subsequent brain atrophy ballard et al . the natural history of ad could be divided in three different phases the pre clinical phase where the pathogenic mechanisms of the disease have started but no symptoms can be identified the prodromal phase where mild cognitive symptoms appear but there are not severe enough to meet dementia criteria and the dementia phase dubois et al . on the other hand these criteria have shown to have good sensitivity and specificity to distinguish between patients with ad type dementia and non demented subjects but are less accurate to differentiate ad dementia from other primary dementias knopman et al . in fact up to 20 of patients clinically diagnosed with ad do not have ad pathology at autopsy mayeux et al . a more accurate and earlier diagnosis of ad e.g. in this context there is a need of specific biological markers for ad diagnosis in the earliest stages . in the case of ad different biomarkers have been described using diverse approaches . the development of cerebrospinal fluid csf assays and neuroimaging techniques that can provide information about the presence of ad pathological changes has been a major step forward in the field . consequently biomarkers for ad are called to play a central role in the clinical characterization of the disease . more recently the nincds adrda criteria have been revised by the national institute on aging and the alzheimer s association nia aa workgroup to include the experience in research over the past 25 years mckhann et al . the nia aa proposed a series of diagnostic classification from pre clinical ad to mci to full blown ad and introduced csf and neuroimaging biomarkers as supportive features of the disease albert et al . this review will focus on the most widely studied and currently accepted sources of biomarkers in ad csf magnetic resonance imaging mri and nuclear medicine techniques including amyloid imaging . csf biomarker research has focused mainly on molecules related to the central neuropathological features of ad such as a the main component of the senile neuritic plaques snp and tau proteins that are part of the nfts . typically ad patients have lower levels of a42 in the csf compared to normal controls a40 tends to remain constant and tau t tau and phosphorylated tau p tau increase arai et al . 2009 and as measured in vivo by amyloid imaging fagan et al . 2009 as well as with cognitive decline and brain atrophy buerger et al . 2002 low csf a42 and high t tau or p tau proteins have shown high accuracy for ad diagnosis galasko et al . studies that compared ad patients with normal control subjects have demonstrated that low a42 had 78100 sensitivity and 4781 specificity for ad diagnosis high csf t tau levels had 70 sensitivity and 92 specificity and p tau showed 77 sensitivity and 87 specificity . however p tau appears to be better than t tau in the diagnosis of ad and it has shown a positive predictive value of 90 especially p tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 p tau181 hampel et al . 2004b and a recent study showed that the signature of ad based on the csf a42p tau181 ratio cutoffs was present in 90 of the ad patients compared to 36 in the normal control group de meyer et al . although these csf biomarkers seem to be useful to diagnose ad they are not sensitive enough to assess disease progression sunderland et al . cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers might have a role in the differential diagnosis of ad and other dementias . patients with dementia with lewy bodies dlb like ad patients have lower levels of a42 in the csf compared to normal controls reflecting that most of these subjects also present ad pathology . in ftd csf a42 levels are lower than in control subjects but higher than in ad while t tau and p tau levels are higher than in controls but lower that in ad patients hulstaert et al . 2001 current data suggest that p tau levels could be the most relevant marker to differentiate ad from other types of dementias hampel et al . cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers may also be useful in predicting progression to ad in subjects with mci andreasen et al . 2006 found high sensitivity 95 and specificity 87 for the conversion from mci to ad dementia using a combination of t tau and a42p tau181 ratio cutoff values . the csf biomarkers have been used to identify the pre clinical stage of ad . a longitudinal csf study in normal controls found increased t tau levels and no change in a42 after a 1year follow up vemuri a few longitudinal studies have assessed which csf biomarker or combination of biomarkers better predict ad dementia or cognitive decline . although there are studies that showed that csf a42 could predict prodromal ad there was a wide sd in these subjects which made difficult to determine individually who will progress to ad . 2003 testa et al . in ad there is also a greater rate of brain atrophy over time compared with healthy elderly subjects 1.92.2 per year versus 0.50.7 per year obrien et al . 2008 mri studies show a similar pattern of brain atrophy to that observed in ad jack et al . 2008 and rates of whole brain atrophy are around 1 per year between ad and control subjects jack et al . 2010 and predicts progression to ad dementia spulber et al . whole brain techniques have also shown that higher rates of atrophy in specific areas such as the hippocampus posterior cingulated gyrus and superior parietal cortex were associated with incident ad in mci cases chetelat et al . interestingly a recent study showed that normal subjects with the ad csf profile had increased rates of brain atrophy over time suggesting they may be in the pre clinical phase of the neurodegenerative process schott et al . because the most important clinical manifestation of ad is memory loss the majority of the researchers have focused on the study of hippocampal atrophy as a marker of the disease . 2004 and with ad pathology and hippocampal sclerosis in mri post mortem studies jagust et al . there are several limitations for the use of whole brain or hippocampal volume as a sole biomarker for ad . on the other hand the rate of change on whole brain entorhinal and hippocampal volumes seemed to be good markers of neurodegeneration and they can be useful in determining the effects of ad therapies but these techniques are labor intensive and limited to research studies . on the other hand the sensitivity of this procedure discriminating ad from ftd was 71.5 and the specificity was 78.2 while its sensitivity and specificity to differentiate ad from vascular dementia were 71.3 and 75.9 respectively dougall et al . a meta analysis showed that pooled f fdg pet sensitivity and specificity to differentiate ad patients from normal subjects were 86 in both cases but the variability was important between the studies sensitivity from 61 to 100 and specificity from 54 to 100 patwardhan et al . 2005 f fdg pet appears to be a promising instrument to discriminate those patients with mci who will progress to ad dementia . 2009 or with a maternal history of ad mosconi et al 2007 2009 . 2007 pre clinical ad sperling et al . c pib retention in ad correlates with rates of whole brain atrophy archer et al . recent longitudinal studies in ad patients assessing amyloid load and progression of neurodegeneration using structural mri or f fdg pet found that c pib retention was relatively stable over time while neurodegenerative markers worsen in parallel with cognitive decline engler et al . however another recent study has shown increases of c pib retention in mild to moderate ad dementia questioning this hypothesis and suggesting that a deposition might slow down in the later stages of the disease but it is still present villemagne et al . 2010 and an increased rate of brain atrophy scheinin et al . 2009 while others have found brain atrophy only in c pib positive subjects or in normal individuals with subjective cognitive impairment chetelat et al . there are only two longitudinal studies reporting progression of cognitively normal subjects scanned with c pib pet to symptomatic ad . 2011 performed serial c pib pet scans in a group of normal subjects and found that 25 of individuals with a positive scan developed mci or ad dementia by 3 years . these data are consistent with the hypothesis that amyloid imaging can detect a accumulation in advance of the onset of dementia jack et al . however it has been reported the case of a patient clinically diagnosed of mild ad with a negative c pib pet scan where low levels of amyloid pathology at autopsy were found cairns et al . in this scenario adding techniques that assess functional brain changes suggesting early ad could be of special interest . current data suggest that diagnosis of ad can be enhanced by use of these promising biomarkers to increase accuracy and identify early stages of the disease . each of these biomarkers seems to indicate a specific process in ad so that amyloid imaging and decreased csf a42 are indicators of brain amyloid burden while csf tau brain atrophy and brain metabolism are biomarkers of the neurodegenerative process . the ad pathologic cascade appears to have a sequential two stage process initiated by amyloid accumulation and followed by neuronal pathology . an early ad diagnosis could enable to administer treatments with potential disease modifying effect before neurodegeneration becomes severe .", " thus it is of vital importance to explore effective therapeutic options in order to alleviate the symptoms or retard the disease progression in sca3 . in this context ngf and its high affinity receptor tachykinin receptor antagonist tkra these data imply that ngf may have neuroprotective effects on cerebellar neurons and hence might serve as a therapeutic candidate of sca3 . therefore this clinical pilot study was set forth to examine the efficacy of ngf in patients with sca3 . this study was an open label clinical trial assessing the efficacy of ngf in patients with sca3 it was conducted at the first affiliated hospital of zhengzhou university from november 2011 to november 2012 . scores of sara and its subsections at baseline 2 and 4 weeks after ngf therapy comparisons between midpoint of therapy and baseline comparisons between endpoint of therapy and baseline . ngf can prevent neuronal death or age related atrophy in the adult brain by inhibiting apoptosis of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain and it would be reasonable to postulate that it may also inhibit the apoptosis in the cerebellum neurons expressing tyrosine kinase a trka and serve as a potential therapy for sca3 . to our knowledge this study is the first to investigate the efficacy of ngf in sca3 . these two proposed mechanisms may explain the observed improvement after therapy and substantiate the use ngf to treat a patient with sca3 . however in one randomized double blind and placebo controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of varenicline in sca3 patients the mean improvements of sara score in the therapeutic group and the placebo group were 1.97 and 0.86 respectively . nevertheless our pilot data suggest that ngf may be a promising treatment for patients with sca3 . a large scale randomized double blind placebo controlled trial would be worthwhile to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of ngf in sca3 patients .", " one of the most widely published and scientifically attractive subjects is the sensing of dna with nanopores . the covalent attachment of dna strands has also been exploited to control the electronic properties of a pore . 2004 were the first to demonstrate that dna modified nanopores can function as ionic switches . the ion current rectification was explained by assuming that dna molecules deflect by the external electric field and cause voltage dependent pore opening . with the aim of achieving a greater pore blockade and ion current modulations this study attempts to tune the ionic pore properties by restricting dna immobilization to a small nanoscale region . we compared the current voltage curves of single nanopores before and after dna modification at different kcl concentrations between 1 m and 10 mm . the experimental results indicate that the attached dna either reduced or blocked the ionic current flow through the pore dependent on ionic strength which also influenced the conformation of the dna strands odijk 1977 skolnick and fixman 1977 kaiser and rant 2010 . 1scheme of the surface charge pattern obtained in the process of one sided modification of a single conically shaped nanopore with point tethered dna molecules . carboxyl groups are formed in the process of pore preparation scheme of the surface charge pattern obtained in the process of one sided modification of a single conically shaped nanopore with point tethered dna molecules . carboxyl groups are formed in the process of pore preparation in addition the dna modified conical nanopores presented here function as rectifiers . by contrast the dna modified nanopores presented here feature an opening diameter that is tuned by the operation conditions e.g. both sides of a single nanopore membrane were placed in contact with 1 m kcl . due to the conical pore shape the concentrations of edc and dna were high at the first tens of nanometers at the narrow tip and decayed hyperbolically along the pore axis . four dna modified nanopores with opening diameters between 4 and 12 nm were studied . we used a two electrode setup in which the electrode placed at the narrow end of a conical nanopore was grounded while the other electrode next to the big pore opening was used to apply a given potential difference with respect to the ground electrode . both sides of a single nanopore membrane were placed in contact with 1 m kcl . due to the conical pore shape the concentrations of edc and dna were high at the first tens of nanometers at the narrow tip and decayed hyperbolically along the pore axis . four dna modified nanopores with opening diameters between 4 and 12 nm were studied . we used a two electrode setup in which the electrode placed at the narrow end of a conical nanopore was grounded while the other electrode next to the big pore opening was used to apply a given potential difference with respect to the ground electrode . similar to previous reports the conical nanopore rectified the ion current due to breaking of the symmetry of the electric potential inside the pore siwy and fulinski 2002 hanggi and marchesoni 2009 cervera et al . opening diameters of the modeled nanopore were set at 5 and 500 nm it is well known that the pores rectify only if the walls have excess surface charge and when the pore diameter is comparable to the thickness of the electrical double layer siwy and fulinski 2002 cervera et al . a very different behavior was observed after modifying the tip of the same nanopore with 30nucleotide long ssdna . figure 3 compares current voltage curves of the pore before and after dna modification for 1 m 0.1 m and 10 mm kcl . for all these concentrations the dna modification caused a significant decrease of the current which suggests that the long dna molecules physically occluded the pore and diminished its effective opening diameter.fig . 2 after modification with 30nucleotide ssdna for a 1 m kcl b 0.1 m kcl and c 10 mm kcl two sweeps from 4 to 4 v are shown for the dna modified nanopore . 2 after modification with 30nucleotide ssdna for a 1 m kcl b 0.1 m kcl and c 10 mm kcl two sweeps from 4 to 4 v are shown for the dna modified nanopore . in 1 and 0.1 m kcl no differences between currents recorded for forward and reverse voltage sweeps were observed the experimental results suggest that occlusion of the pore by dna becomes more pronounced with lowering the ionic strength . at 1 m kcl attachment of dna caused a decrease of 2.5fold of ion current compared to a non modified pore fig . 3a while at 10 mm kcl the dna modified nanopore exhibited at least five times lower current fig . insertion of dna molecules in the pore can therefore cause a decrease or an increase of the current depending on whether the number of excluded ions is larger or smaller than the number of additionally introduced dna counterions . in dependence of the concentration of the background electrolyte the pore threaded dna molecules caused a positive or negative spike of the current . applied to our dna modified pore this high length obviously increases the volume of the dna strands and could thereby help explain the high level of occlusion observed for the nanopore which measures 8 nm in diameter fig . when a positively biased electrode is placed at the wide opening of the pore the dna molecules are expected to be deflected away from the narrow opening and toward the wide opening which does not present any significant steric hindrance for the strands fig . reducing the positive voltage and switching it to the negative values forces the dna strands to deflect toward the small opening of the pore fig . 3d for an 8nm diameter nanopore modified with dna recorded when the voltage was changed from 4 to 4 v. insets schematically indicate possible configurations of the attached dna molecules as a function of applied voltage two current voltage curves the same as shown in fig . 3d for an 8nm diameter nanopore modified with dna recorded when the voltage was changed from 4 to 4 v. insets schematically indicate possible configurations of the attached dna molecules as a function of applied voltage by contrast when the voltage is swept from negative to positive values dna molecules have to deflect from the small opening toward the large opening of the pore . we think that this process occurs with significantly more severe steric hindrance because lowering the negative applied voltage decreases the ionic concentrations in the pore causing the dna to maintain a more elongated form induced by the high voltage thereby leading to a greater pore blockade . in order to support our general hypothesis on the conformation dependent occlusion of nanopores by dna molecules we expected that in this case the dna would lead to a less extensive pore blockade based on geometric grounds . figure 5 shows the current voltage curves of the 12nm pore in 0.1 m kcl ph 8 before and after dna attachment . 2006

shaped nanopore with a narrow opening of 12 nm . b current voltage curves of 12nm dna modified nanopore in 10 mm kcl ph 8 for forward bias gray squares and reverse bias red squares a current voltage curves before and after modification with 30mer ssdna of a single conically shaped nanopore with a narrow opening of 12 nm . b current voltage curves of 12nm dna modified nanopore in 10 mm kcl ph 8 for forward bias gray squares and reverse bias red squares the wider nanopore also exhibited an ion current rectification degree in 0.1 m kcl 4 v equal to almost 17 which is three times higher than the rectification degree of the 8nm dna modified pore fig . for concentrations that are lower than the optimum for a given pore diameter with dna the nanopore is effectively smaller so that the pore might be outside its optimal rectifying regime . our experimental results provide evidence that the level of nanopore blockage and most likely the persistence length of tethered dna increase with lower kcl concentration . due to the salt dependent dna volume the nanopore changes its effective diameter and thus can be applicable in building systems to control transport of both charged and neutral species . in future research we will systematically study the transport properties of dna modified pores as a function of dna length . we will also try to identify a particular ratio of dna length and pore diameter under which dna modified nanopores exhibit spontaneous openings and closings of the pore similar to biological voltage gated channels .", " as expected ginip ib4 neurons showed a remarkable enrichment in mrgprd transcripts and ginip ib4 neurons revealed a striking enrichment of the three known markers of c ltmrs tafa4 th and vglut3 . deeper comparison of the rna seq data revealed distinct transcriptional signatures between mrgprd expressing neurons and c ltmrs that were further confirmed by in situ hybridization analysis of over 100 genes . most importantly in addition to providing the transcriptional signatures of two categories of primary sensory neurons our study expands the molecular characterization of c ltmrs and suggests that this particular subset of primary sensory neurons shares many molecular features of ltmrs . accordingly they were highly and broadly expressed in drg neurons in allen brain atlas database . most importantly quick analysis of the reads per kilobase per million of reads rpkm generated for genes expected to be enriched in each sorted subpopulation revealed high enrichment of mrgprd and p2rx3 in the dp subset th and tafa4 in c ltmrs and cgrp and sp in the dn neurons figure 1e providing the first proof of concept of the successful outcome of our experimental paradigm . we found 486 genes enriched in dp subset 549 in c ltmrs and 2916 in dn subset tables s3 s4 and s5 . as a result we obtained 156 transcripts preferentially expressed in the dp subset 184 in c ltmrs and 784 in the dn population figure 2b tables s6 s7 and s8 . in agreement with our rna seq data genes expressed in neurons were excluded from dp neurons and c ltmrs . furthermore we found 613 genes expressed in trka peptidergic neurons and others 213 excluded from this neuronal population revealing the heterogeneity of the dn subset figure s3 . because the aim of this study consisted at deciphering the transcriptional signatures that confer the functional specializations of mrgprd expressing cutaneous free nerve ending and c ltmrs we analyzed the expression patterns of 48 dp enriched genes and 68 c ltmtrs enriched genes . in line with our rna seq data sets the 48 dp enriched probes were highly expressed in the dp neurons and virtually excluded from c ltmrs httpwww.ibdm.univmrs.frequipesreyndersdpishlibrary.pptx . however the vast majority of the dp enriched genes displayed an additional expression pattern outside dp neurons . 12 genes showed some expression in few ginip ib4 neurons 17 genes showed lower expression in discrete subsets of small 317 or medium to large size neurons 1417 and 19 genes were expressed in broader neuronal subsets in addition to intense expression in dp neurons figures 2c2e dp ish library . the same strategy applied to c ltmrs enriched genes showed that all 68 tested genes were expressed in c ltmrs and massively excluded from dp neurons httpwww.ibdm.univmrs.frequipesreynderscltmrsishlibrary.pptx . one striking feature of c ltmrs enriched genes is that the vast majority was also expressed in medium to large size drg neurons whereas only two were expressed in small neurons . indeed out of the 68 tested genes six were specifically expressed in c ltmrs as they only marked a subset of ginip neurons that do not bind ib4 figures 3a3f . quantitative analyses showed that ceacam10 is expressed in 71.2 6.3 of c ltmrs wfdc2 in 73.4 1.7 cacna1i in 89.2 5.9 c1ql4 in 70 1.8 fbp2 in 19.9 4.7 and bok in 62.7 6.4 of c ltmrs figure 3 g further highlighting our previously suggested molecular heterogeneity of this particular class of neurons delfini et al . the remaining 60 genes could be split in three categories 18 genes exhibited high expression in c ltmrs but also marked a discrete subset of large diameter neurons 23 genes showed equal levels of expression in c ltmrs and in large diameter neurons and 19 genes exhibited a very high enrichment in larger diameter neurons and a discrete expression in c ltmrs figures 4a4c cltmrs ishlibrary . because 88 of c ltmrs enriched genes displayed an additional expression preferentially in large diameter neurons we sought to unravel the molecular identity of these neurons . dp neurons exhibited a high enrichment in g protein coupled receptors as well as in transcripts encoding signaling molecules such as gna14 gna1 gnaq plcb3 prkca prkcd and prkcq figures 5a and s5a table s9 whereas c ltmrs exhibited a striking enrichment in transcripts associated with voltage gated ion channel activity figures 6a and s5b table s10 . our ish experiments showed that agtr1a is expressed in dp neurons but not in c ltmrs or other subsets of drg neurons figure 5b whereas ptgdr was found at higher intensity in dp neurons compared to c ltmrs and large size neurons figure 5c . in addition to gpcrs go analysis revealed a striking enrichment of transcripts encoding signaling molecules in dp neurons including gna14 gna1 gnaq plcb3 prkca prkcd and prkcq table s9 . our in situ screen showed that all these transcripts were highly expressed in dp neurons and virtually absent in c ltmrs figures 5d5 g . regarding c ltmrs one of the most striking observations with respect to the go analysis was the high enrichment in transcripts associated with voltage gated ion channel activity . ish screen showed that cacna1i is specifically expressed in c ltmrs figure 3c and kcnj12 and cacna1h are expressed in c ltmrs as well as in some large diameter neurons but excluded from dp neurons figures 6b and 6c . in situ analysis of ano6 and slc12a7 showed that both transcripts were expressed in c ltmrs but not in dp neurons and exhibited some expression in large drg neurons figures 6d and 6e . our ish data showed that both cckar and p2ry1 transcripts were highly enriched in c ltmrs totally excluded from dp neurons and displayed expression in some large diameter neurons figures 6f 6 g and s4b . together our data provide a functional description of sets of genes differentially expressed in dp versus c ltmrs . the differential expression of such clusters of genes likely contributes to differences in signal transduction intrinsic membrane excitability and the firing properties of c ltmrs and mrgprd neurons . our ish showed that transcripts encoding both channels were expressed in c ltmrs with cav3.3 being exclusively expressed in this neuronal subset figures 3e and 7a . together our electrophysiological data nicely corroborate the rna seq and the ish expression data demonstrating that both cav3.2 and cav3.3 channels are concomitantly expressed in c ltmrs and that both channels are absent in the free nerve ending mrgprd expressing neurons . in this study we used our recently generated mouse model in which the cutaneous mrgprd expressing neurons and c ltmrs were genetically marked by the m cherry protein in combination with ib4 live staining followed by cell sorting and rna deep sequencing to gene profile three categories of primary sensory neurons the free nerve ending mrgpd expressing neurons c ltmrs and a heterogeneous population of drg cells that neither bind ib4 nor are labeled by the m cherry protein . because the dn population is composed of a variety of neuronal subsets and glial cells dn data set was used to identify genes specifically enriched in the free nerve ending mrgprd expressing neurons and those specifically enriched in c ltmrs . this analysis yielded 156 genes specifically enriched in the dp neurons and 184 in c ltmrs . which genes should one pursue and what should be done with these lists of genes the answer to this question was motivated by our objectives to expand the molecular characterization of c ltmrs and to identify the combinatorial expression of the key genes that shape the functional specialization of the free nerve endings mrgprd neurons and c ltmrs . 2013 our rna seq data in combination with ish and gene ontology analysis revealed a great number of genes expressed in dp neurons but not in c ltmrs and vice versa reflecting their anatomical and functional differences . indeed dp neurons showed very high enrichment in genes encoding gpcrs and signaling molecules in addition to a selective expression of three isoforms of the protein kinase c family . c ltmrs on the other hand expressed different gpcrs than those expressed in dp neurons such as cckar and the metabotropic gq p2y1 receptor and showed a striking enrichment in voltage gated channels including potassium channels kcnq2 kcnj12 kcnv1 kcna2 and kcna4 sodium channels and associated beta subunits scn1a scn1b scn3b scn4b scn7a and scn8a and the low voltage gated calcium channels cacna1h and cacna1i . among the three t type channels we found cav3.2 and cav3.3 highly present in c ltmrs with cav3.3 being exclusively expressed in this particular class of neurons . our rna seq data in combination with ish and electrophysiological recordings provided a clear demonstration that cav3.3 is a specific marker of c ltmrs and offers a new possible selective pharmacological target to control c ltmrs excitability in mice . finally a recent elegant study using an unbiased large scale single cell rna sequencing revealed 11 molecularly distinct subsets of primary sensory neurons including the th expressing c ltmrs population usoskin et al . however our ish experiments showed that the vast majority of c ltmrs enriched genes were also expressed in other neurons preferentially in the nf200 neurons further supporting our strategy to validate the specific expression of the identified enriched genes using ish approach . given that the majority of c ltmrs enriched genes were also expressed in nf200 neurons and that nf200 is a hallmark of proprioceptive and a and a ltmrs abraira and ginty 2013 we postulate that c ltmrs share many molecular features with some a and a ltmrs . in conclusion data presented in this study provide a wealth of information about the presence and prevalence of transcripts from known and previously unknown genes in three categories of primary sensory neurons they highlight the differential expression of a great number of genes in two diametrically opposite classes of cutaneous afferents the ish screen followed by immunostaining and ib4 binding led to the generation of two open access libraries that allow monitoring the cellular distribution of 115 genes they provide the first electrophysiological recording of a low voltage gated ca channel exclusively present in c ltmrs and they suggest that c ltmrs share many molecular features with a and a ltmrs . the expression patterns of dn enriched genes the co expression of c ltmrs enriched genes with nf200 neurons the supplemental tables enclosing dp c ltmrs and dn enriched genes as well as the go analysis are provided in the supplemental information .", " moreover in order to clear the er from the accumulation of terminally misfolded protein aggregates that can not be degraded by the proteasome the upr may upregulate the autophagy machinery 5 6 . in spite of its role as a self digestion mechanism autophagy is mainly activated to protect against cell death . however just like in the case of the upr stimulation of autophagy can under certain circumstances be required to activate the cell death machinery . although both the upr and autophagy can function independently from each other recent reports show that they may be interlinked and share the functional duality of exerting both a cytoprotective under basal or metabolic stress conditions and cytocidial activity after acute cellular damage . tumor cells are bathed in a hostile microenvironment and confronted with chronic metabolic stress conditions that favor the activation of adaptive mechanisms such as the upr and autophagy 10 11.moreover certain promising anticancer regimens have been shown to activate concomitantly er stress and autophagy in cancer cells see section 4 . the molecular link between the upr and the autophagic response to er stress and how these stress pathways influence therapeutic outcome remain largely undefined making this topic a very important area for future research in cancer therapy . here we review the molecular mechanisms underlying the emerging connections between the upr and autophagy pathways and discuss their potential implications in the context of anticancer therapy . the mechanisms by which upr induction coupled with the failure in reestablishing the er folding capacity leads to cell death and the requirement of upr signaling in autophagy stimulation are still unsettled questions . furthermore recent studies have revealed that the er serves as a subcellular platform for the formation of signaling complexes comprising molecular elements of the upr bcl2 family members both pro and antiapoptotic reviewed in and perhaps regulators of autophagy . depending on the cellular context activation of jnk can either allow the cells to adapt to er stress by initiating autophagy or as discussed further promote apoptosis in response to persistent or irrecoverable er stress . whether this pathway has any role in normal cells expressing both mitochondrial and er bax bak still needs to be proven however it can already be argued that jnk functions as a master regulator of both apoptosis and perhaps autophagy pathways after er stress . as discussed below a variety of stress signals such as nutrient starvation or treatment with different anticancer agents including those that induce er stress stimulate the autophagy process which is nowadays considered as an essential cellular process participating in a number of physiological functions within the cell . the molecular mechanisms responsible for the regulation of autophagy have not been completely elucidated yet although genetic and biochemical analyses performed during the last few years have identified several autophagy genes atg that participate in the regulation of this cellular process . initiation of autophagy relies on the formation of an isolation membrane i m at the so called preautophagosomal site . in these sections we will briefly summarize the mechanisms by which the different stages of autophagy are regulated . in addition mtorc1 has been proposed to regulate autophagy by repressing the activity of the atg1atg13atg17fip200 complex 9295 . as discussed in the following sections modulation of mtorc1 activity is one of the mechanisms by which er stress and autophagy become connected . different stimuli including er stress modulate the interaction between beclin1 and bcl2 family members see also the following sections which is considered an important mechanism of autophagy regulation . thus upon autophagy stimulation atg5 is conjugated to atg12 . accordingly autophagy plays a dual role in cancer . different situations that induce er stress also lead to induction of autophagy . likewise autophagy can help cells to cope with er stress for instance contributing to the elimination of unfolded or aggregated proteins or participate in the mechanism of er stress induced cell death 115 117119 . in this section we will try to delineate some of the proposed mechanisms by which er stress and autophagy become connected under certain cellular situations figure 2 . in these experiments a dominant negative form of perk or genetic substitution of serine 51 of eif2 by ala which prevents the phosphorylation of this protein prevented polyq protein induced autophagy strongly suggesting that perk dependent eif2 phosphorylation plays an important role in the activation of autophagy in response to the accumulation of unfolded proteins . on the other hand eif2 phosphorylation seems to be also important for autophagy as induced by other er stress related or unrelated stimuli 75 120 121 . regarding the signalling pathways by which eif2 phosphorylation can modulate autophagy kouroku and et al showed that perk eif2dependent atg12 upregulation is required for induction of autophagy in response to polyq protein accumulation which suggests that controlling the expression of autophagy related genes by eif2 downstream targets could be one of the mechanisms connecting both events . we also showed that an important step in the induction of autophagy is the inhibition of the akt mtorc1 axis by the pseudokinase trb3 see below for additional details figure 2 . in any case further research is still necessary to clarify the precise mechanisms by which eif2 phosphorylation regulates autophagy in response to different er stress signals . activation of the ire1 arm of the er stress response has also been shown to regulate autophagy . thus treatment with tunicamycin or thapsigargin or treatment with proteasome inhibitors induced autophagy on an ire1dependent manner . of interest jnk has been proposed to regulate autophagy through bcl2 phosphorylation which prevents this protein of interacting and inhibiting the essential autophagy regulator beclin1 99 124 125 . as discussed above beclin1 is associated to the vps34 and plays a very important role in the regulation of autophagy see below figure 2 . it is therefore conceivable that activation of the ire1traf2jnk arm of er stress may regulate autophagy through modulation of beclin1 function and expression . these observations suggest that the xbp1 may play a different role than traf2jnk on the regulation of autophagy by the ire1 arm of the upr . jttel and coworkers showed that increases in cytosolic ca concentration upon treatment with different er stress inducers stimulate camkk leading in turn to ampk activation inhibition of mtorc1 and autophagy stimulation . another ca activated kinase that regulates autophagy in response to er stress is the death associated protein kinase 1 dapk . thus dapk deficient mefs are less sensitive to er stress induced autophagy than their wild type counterparts . regarding the mechanisms by which dapk regulates autophagy it has been recently shown that dapk phosphorylates beclin1 on the bh3only domain preventing thus the interaction of this protein with bcl2 133 134 . as p53 modulates autophagy through different mechanisms 112 136138 this could be another way by which dapk could regulate autophagy in response to certain er stress stimuli . the protein kinase c theta pkc has been also implicated in regulating autophagy in response to er stress in a calcium dependent manner . thus knock down of pkc but not inactivation of the upr signalling routes prevented autophagy as induced by acute er stress . in this study inactivation of mtorc1 under the used concentrations of thapsigargin thapsigargin were not observed which suggests that different signalling routes may converge in the regulation of autophagy under er stress situations involving calcium mobilization . another link between ca er stress and autophagy relies on the modulation of the inositol 145trisphosphate receptor ip3r . further investigation is nevertheless necessary to clarify whether this mechanism participates in the activation of autophagy in response to er stress . as discussed for the case of er stress autophagy is currently considered a cell survival mechanism that under certain cellular settings can also promote cell death . consequently depending on whether pharmacological or genetic inhibition of autophagy enhances or prevents cell death activation of autophagy after er stress has been assigned respectively a cytotoxic 75 115 119 132 145147 or a protective 5 6 115 119 128 role . an important problem at the time of predicting whether induction of er stress will activate autophagy in a protective or cytotoxic way is our relative lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which autophagy regulates cell death . as discussed in the previous section some of the key regulatory steps in the activation of autophagy upon stimulation of er stress such as mtorc1 inhibition or the interaction of beclin1 with bcl2 can also receive signals derived from different inputs including those not directly related with er stress . moreover some of the regulatory proteins transmitting these signals such as akt ampk dapk or jnk play also a major role in the modulation of cell survival independently of autophagy . it is therefore essential to consider the cellular context in order to understand how the different er stress signals are integrated to yield a protective or cytotoxic autophagic response . from the above discussion it is clear that er stress and autophagy can activate both prosurvival mechanisms as well as lethal programs especially under conditions of enduring er stress and organellar damage . thus activation of the upr and autophagy may either impede or facilitate drug mediated cell killing and it is plausible that this will depend on the type of cancer and cytotoxic agents used . while a growing number of reports have started to identify molecular elements of the cross talk between er stress and autophagy see section 3.2 thus unraveling potential druggable targets knowledge of the functional outcome of the activation of these pathways in cancer cells responding to chemotherapeutics is still very limited . moreover if autophagy activated following er stress is a survival response restoring er homeostasis e.g. on the other hand autophagy may endorse the proapoptotic functions of certain er stress pathways see also section 4.1 or become a lethal backup pathway in cancer cells with defect on apoptotic signaling 133 148 . a wide array of conventional and experimental chemotherapeutic agents has been shown to stimulate er stress and activation of upr along with autophagy in cancer cells . similarly the resistance to imatinib mesylate a bcr abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor used for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia might also rely at least in part on the secondary activation of er stress induced autophagy . understanding the precise molecular mechanisms that regulate the extent of autophagy activation in response to different triggering signals as well as the ones that control the interplay of this cellular process with apoptosis is therefore crucial to design new antitumoral therapies based on the modulation of the er stress autophagy response . induction of autophagy in er stressed cells unable to mount an apoptotic response because of bax bak deficiency results in increased photokilling suggesting the activation of an conversely in apoptosis competent cells blocking autophagy stimulation following er stress by sirnas that target essential modulators of the autophagic machinery sensitizes to cell death thus revealing a cytoprotective role for this pathway dewaele m. and agostinis p. unpublished results . hence it is tempting to speculate that autophagy inhibition may potentiate the proapoptotic perk pathway resulting in a better therapeutic opportunity only when the cancer cell s apoptotic machinery has not been fully disabled . furthermore these processes are functionally coupled and proteasomal inhibition has been shown to stimulate autophagy likely as a compensatory mechanism . indeed autophagy was shown to be activated in mcf7 cells treated with bortezomib by a mechanism which involved proteasomal stabilization of atf4 and atf4 dependent upregulation of lc3b . research during the last decade has contributed to highlight the important role of er stress and autophagy in the maintenance of the cellular homeostasis . the last few years have also evidenced that both processes are closely related as some of the signalling routes activated during the er stress response are involved in stimulating autophagy . by contrast induction of er stress in cancer cells may promote the stimulation of autophagy mediated cell death or the activation of a protective autophagy that may contribute to the resistance to certain antitumoral therapies .", " bevacizumab related htn may serve as a predictor biomarker of response survival in patients with mcrc treated with bevacizumb in first line setting . these results strengthen previous evidence that bevacizumab related htn may be a potential predictive biomarker for bevacizumab efficacy . retrospective studies have shown that patients who develop bevacizumab induced htn showed increased response rates and progression free survival pfs in comparison with those who did not . the highest value of arterial blood pressure recorded was taken into account to define the grade of bevacizumab induced arterial htn according to the grading of the national cancer institute grade 23 arterial htn was the cut off level for htn definition in accordance with previous reports indicating this level to be biologically and clinically relevant.3 9 patients were then stratified into two groups those who did not present htn grade 01 and those who presented bevacizumab related htn grade 23 . odds

accordance with previous reports indicating this level to be biologically and clinically relevant.3 9 patients were then stratified into two groups those who did not present htn grade 01 and those who presented bevacizumab related htn grade 23 . odds ratios or was used to compare the relative odds of response disease control given the development or not of bevacizumab related htn . the majority of patients 85.4 in the group who developed bevacizumab related htn had an ecog ps 1 while in the group who did not almost 66 presented an ecog ps of 0 . in the group of patients who developed bevacizumab related htn 30 73.2 presented response to treatment complete response crpartial response pr and 40 of them 97.6 achieved dc cr pr or stable disease compared to 7 patients 18.4 with response and 24 63.2 with dc in the group of those who did not develop htn or 12.08 95 ci 4.13 to 35.29 p0.001 responders vs non responders or 20.8 95 ci 2.56 to 168.91 p 0.005 controlled vs non controlled disease figures 1 and 2 . number of patients with response in the groups of grade 23 bevacizumab induced htn and without bevacizumab related htn . number of patients with disease control in the groups of grade 23 bevacizumab induced htn and without bevacizumab related htn . in the group that developed bevacizumab related htn the median os was 33 months 25.740.3 and in the group that did not it was 21 months 16.525.5 with no significant statistical difference between the 2 groups p 0.114 figure 4 . twenty per cent of the patients developed grades 23 htn with a significant improvement in response rate 73.2 vs 18.4 p0.001 and pfs 14.5 months vs 3.1 months p0.001 being observed in the group of patients who developed bevacizumab related htn with no statistically significant difference in the median os . in the sterlund et al14 study 56 of the patients presented htn with results showing that htn predicted bevacizumab treatment efficacy regardless of the analysed end point os pfs or rr . in our study 51.9 patients developed htn g2g3 during chemotherapy bevacizumab treatment which is superior to that reported in other retrospective trials.6 12 16 according to a recently published large meta analysis the incidence of htn in bevacizumab treated patients with cancer was 23.6.18 a possible explanation may be that our study population presents a high predominance of the male gender being more frequently affected by primary htn suggesting that bevacizumab related htn may present the same biological pathway or that this increase may be possibly due to selection bias since it is a retrospective trial . our results seem to be in line with published data with patients who developed bevacizumab related htn showing an improvement in clinical outcomes namely response rates 73.2 vs 18.4 p0.001 responders vs non responders disease control 97.6 vs 63.2 p 0.005 controlled disease vs non controlled and pfs p0.001 . the accumulating evidence seems to imply that the identification of a reliable clinical factor such as bevacizumab induced grades 23 arterial htn may constitute an early indicator efficacy whereas lack of this side effect could represent a warning of lack of activity and maybe justify an early change in the treatment strategy for example egfr inhibitors.9 10 in the context of an exponential increase in economic treatment costs contributed by targeted therapy the identification of a reliable non invasive feasible and not costly predictive factor that would allow the selection of patients tumours more likely to benefit from treatment and spare those who would not from additional toxicity is urgent.3 19 in conclusion in this subset of patients htn g2 3 demonstrated to be predictive of response to treatment with bevacizumab and of pfs . bevacizumab treatment related htn is a very interesting subject at the moment and prospective studies to disclose whether bevacizumab associated htn predicts outcome and the exact mechanism for the development of anti vegf related htn are needed .", " however there are still barriers which researchers must overcome before such data can be exploited such as lack of computationally accessible salivary data and information and inability to cross reference the salivaomics data that could potentially be made available through different proteomics transcriptomics genomics and metabolomics studies . for these reasons there is an urgent need to create the salivaomics knowledge base skb a data management system and web resource constructed to support saliva diagnostics research and we present below the informatics advances brought about through the skb and through the associated tools and resources . in analogy to efforts in other fields a consortium of research groups specializing in different areas of study would undertake such an effort each building different components of ontology to support dental research . initial efforts in this direction by scientists in dental research and biomedical ontology at university at buffalo and university of california include work on the ontology of oral pathology oral maxillofacial anatomy dental disease and dental procedures and as we discuss below the saliva ontology . integral to his work is a plan to allow a seamless connection between the use of ontology to support dental research in the dental domain and the use of existing ontology resources developed in other areas of biology and medicine by reusing elements and strategies from them . the saliva ontology salo figure 1 is a detailed ontology of this bodily fluid that is optimized to meet the needs of both the clinical diagnostic community and the cross disciplinary community of omics researchers . the salo is created through cross disciplinary interaction with saliva experts protein experts diagnosticians and ontologists . to aid development and testing of salo we develop a corpus of saliva relevant literature in skb to assist in characterizing core terms and synonyms within the ontology and to provide links between salo content and relevant items in pubmed . salo will incorporate links to existing ontologies and terminology resources involving treatment of saliva relevant phenomena . we will also identify and represent within salo relationships to saliva relevant types represented in ontologies such as the gene ontology the protein ontology and the chemical entities of biological interest ontology and also provide links to corresponding snomed ct terms where available .", " moreover the histopathological changes after chemotherapy vary in patients . studies have systematically described various histopathological changes seen after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in a variety of tumors including breast carcinoma rectal carcinoma ovarian carcinoma head and neck carcinomas esophageal carcinoma wilms tumor and non small cell lung carcinoma . this study describes the various histopathologic changes seen after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast malignancies squamous cell carcinomas adenocarcinomas and wilms tumor . the present prospective study was carried out on 60 patients including 40 patients with carcinoma breast and 20 patients with other malignancies who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy . the study group was divided into three subgroups group a n 30 and group b n 10 included breast carcinoma patients with initial pathologic material submitted as trucut or wedge biopsy in group a and lumpectomy specimens in group b. group c n 20 included cases of other malignancies besides breast carcinoma who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy . detailed histopathological examination was carried out especially looking for chemotherapy induced histopathologic changes like necrosis fibrosis inflammatory reactions and other retrogressive changes . any change in pattern or type of carcinoma was noted . histologic sections from all the malignancies were observed for any change in differentiation changes in architecture necrobiotic changes and host tissue response . carcinoma breast inflammatory and stromal response seen after neoadjuvant chemotherapy carcinoma breast inflammatory and stromal response seen after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in axillary lymph nodes in the present study of the total 20 cases of group c 12 cases were of squamous cell carcinoma seven from head and neck four of cervix and one of esophagus five cases were of adenocarcinoma and three cases were of wilms tumor . in the present prospective study a spectrum of histopathologic changes was observed with the use of chemotherapy . the effects have been divided into two as pathologic changes in tumor cells and changes in the stroma . pathologically similar changes were observed in response to chemotherapy in draining lymph nodes but not as pronounced as in the primary site . in the present study the most common type was ductal carcinoma nos mucinous change appeared in three patients after chemotherapy who were diagnosed with ductal carcinoma nos type in the initial biopsy and a transformation from ductal to metaplastic carcinoma and from papillary pattern to ductal nos was seen in one case each . squamous cell carcinoma after chemotherapy only necrotic masses of keratin with areas of calcification are left h and e 100 adenocarcinoma abundant pools of mucin with occasional scattered tumor cells after chemotherapy h and e 40 wilms tumor only few bizarre tumor cells persisting along with the mesenchymal component with complete disappearance of the blastemal component which was a triphasic tumor before chemotherapy h and e 200 the results of this study again reveal that the response to chemotherapy may be markedly variable in patients . it was also concluded that the tumor grade decreases and differentiation improves in addition to the retrogressive changes and increase in stromal component as a result of chemotherapy in carcinoma breast as well as in other malignancies .", " consequently several groups have assessed and reported the efficacy of aza in patients with aml . more recently a randomized phase iii trial comparing first line aza to conventional therapies including intensive chemotherapy in elderly patients with aml revealed that aza achieved clinically meaningful survival benefit compared to conventional treatments . we present herein a multi centre retrospective analysis of 77 aml patients who were treated with aza in first line or due to relapsed refractory disease . the main aim was the characterization of the efficacy and safety of aza treatment in aml patients in portugal . we also conducted an exploratory comparison of overall survival between patients receiving 1st line treatment with aza and elderly aml patients treated with ic alone . patients with aml who received at least 1 cycle of

it is at least not inferior to conventional ic .", " there were many studies work on workers health but there were some of them study on cardiovascular system because these disorders have more than one etiology and one of the modifiable risk factors or etiology is work exposure . also shift work stress carboxi hemoglobin cohb solvents noise vibration temperature of environment air pollution can find the high risk personnel with non occupational and occupational risk factors of cardiovascular disorders . had shown that work as a engine driver had cardiovascular risk factors because they had more hypertension and hyperlipidemia than control group . the objective of this study was comparison of cardiovascular risk factors between workers in different industries of iran . this study has been done by completing checklist from medical issues of workers . data were gathered from medical issues because all workers had periodic physical and paraclinic examinations such as blood pressure blood sampling for triglyceride total cholesterol low density lipoprotein high density lipoprotein fasting blood sugar age body mass index work duration smoking shift work . data were gathered from medical issues because all workers had periodic physical and paraclinic examinations such as blood pressure blood sampling for triglyceride total cholesterol low density lipoprotein high density lipoprotein fasting blood sugar age body mass index work duration smoking shift work . results are in three sections general information specific information and cardiovascular risk factors from 875 workers of industries . in table 1 these information had been demonstrated and there were comparison of related variables to cardiovascular disorders between industries workers . comparison of risk factors to cardiovascular disorders between industries workers then number and percent of cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity hypertension hyper triglyceridemia hyper cholestrolemia hyper low density lipoprotein lower high density lipoprotein diabetes mellitus were determined and compared in table 2 . also according to results automobile industry workers had more obesity hypertension hyper triglyceridemia hyper low density lipoprotein lower the high density lipoprotein diabetes mellitus . had demonstrated that work as a engine driver had cardiovascular risk factors because they had more hypertension and hyperlipidemia than control group . in their study had shown that work in railroad industry was a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and can cause hyper low density lipoprotein and total cholesterol in blood specially in workers who had shift work . automobile industry have a lot of cardiovascular risk factors these were fumes and other chemicals physicals control of them can reduce the risk of occupational cardiovascular disorders one of the ways to control was engineering method then administrative and at the end personal protective devices .", " we aimed to test the usefulness of open reimplantations which were performed primarily and after failed endoscopic injection procedures . among them 64 underwent open reimplantation as a primary procedure group a and 17 underwent it after failed endoscopic injection group b . in addition we conducted a telephone based survey of the parents of group b about their preference for endoscopic injection or open reimplantation and the reasons for their preference we asked the parents which surgery do you choose primarily between endoscopic injection again and ureteral reimplantation if your child have to undergo surgery for vesicoureteral reflux again and what is the reason . therefore endoscopic treatments have been preferred as the first line treatment for children with vur . the american urological association aua vesicoureteral reflux guideline update committee analyzed data from 17972 patients and reported that the overall success rate of a single endoscopic treatment was 83.0 . as seen above endoscopic treatment of children with vur had many advantages and a high success rate but there were also many failures especially in the children with more severe reflux . patients who underwent reimplantation as a primary treatment did not differ from those who underwent it after endoscopic injection in terms of age sex operation time hospitalization period or postoperative complications . in open reimplantation for vur after failed endoscopic surgery we also supposed that it may show less success rate more operation time more complications and more hospitalization periods because of ureteral adhesion or inflammation due to primary injection or because each patient had more severe vur . however as in our findings several studies have reported that previous endoscopic treatment does not have an adverse effect on the success of subsequent open reimplantation . in many studies open reimplantation for vur showed much higher success rates than endoscopic treatment for all grades of reflux . these patients were received endoscopic injection again or ureteral reimplantation to treat vur after failed endoscopic injection according to patients conditions and parents demand . however it is meaningful that this study showed open reimplantation can be applied effectively for failed endoscopic surgery . however there were no significant differences in operation time postoperative complications hospitalization period or surgical success rates between open ureteral reimplantation surgery after failed endoscopic injection for vur and primary open reimplantation . in addition parents prefer endoscopic injection as the first line treatment option for their children with vur because of its convenience and reduced postoperative discomfort .", " how can we increase our understanding of health and social services that are located in different organizations lindberg observed examples of meaningful co operation at the local level with colleagues from different organizations meeting and pooling their knowledge of local conditions with the patient or user as the focal point . edgren and stenberg found these practical attributes of co operation in cass a common task is shared among the co working agents.collaboration is in people s minds it is instinctive behaviour.each actor s capabilities are known and respected.a combination of monetary and non monetary incentives exists in order to create lasting mutually acceptable solutions . according to brommels in his presentation to the ehma conference 2006 the cas approach means among other things identifying and supporting constructive relations between agents within the system and understanding tensions and conflicts.avoiding strict definitions of roles and concentrating on agreed actions.giving agents their freedom to organize current activities . it helps us understand what happens in dynamic living systems where many agents are interconnected . for a long time effective organizations the machine has a constructor the top manager who describes the integral parts and how they are supposed to co operate . rationality for example requires that all integral parts act on perfect information have the same background and similar values and work towards the same goals and that there is a system designer the top manager who is from outside the system . when political decisions setting precise goals are centralized and detailed rules are laid down and lines of action specified and when there is constant top down monitoring and assessment there is a very real risk of destroying capacity and motivation at the so called and then when the unforeseen happens the whole system breaks down because there is no readiness or capability to adapt all solutions have been pre programmed beforehand . they provide an alternative to traditional management principles that is they offer patterns and principles whereby we can better act in an increasingly complex world as when we attempt to harness health and social care and other services to meet the particular needs of the individual . in such a way complexity science can serve as a sense making tool . it also enables us to develop locally adapted solutions in order to manage complex tasks such as we find in advanced home health care . and the term complex emphasizes that the necessary competence to perform a task is not owned by any one part but comes as a result of co operation within the system . when everyday work is characterized by both regularities and irregularities by a mix of the predictable and the unpredictable then we have the highest degree of complexity . although more research is needed to achieve greater understanding of complex adaptive systems and to strengthen the knowledge base for action we do have a growing number of examples that show the cas concept gaining ground within the health and social services . we can regard integrated care partners as partners in a common system and we can regard them logically as agents in this system . another example comes from elderly care where the cas concept has been applied to secure agreement between politicians and civil servants . complexity science emphasizes the inherent power of development and self organizing nature of the system . one important aspect of complexity science is that it has shown how complementary knowledge organizes for co operation . it has been found that for purposes of fostering connectivity among diverse agents effective coupling of structures ideas and innovations and ensuring that they are neither too loose nor too tightly interdependent complex systems are better led by indirect than by direct leadership behaviours . in this way we see that the cas approach satisfies the fundamental human need to participate to have a feeling of solidarity to be part of a greater whole . to learn to use a different approach to organizing may mean insecurity and risk similar to being expected to accept new technology . rationality for example requires that all integral parts act on perfect information have the same background and similar values and work towards the same goals and

organizations with complex tasks . leaders may consider accepting complexity instead of trying to reduce it formulate few simple and concrete goals communicate and give feedback and measure performance . are we willing to face the interdependence between health and social services the dependence on collaboration to deliver appropriate integrated care if we do complexity science could be

modification and targeting of cathepsins and cystatins . as figures 4a and 4b show the lysosomes in which cathepsin h or b is located are attached to the cell membrane . cathepsin l is translated as 17 amino acids of prepart 96 amino acids of pro part and 221 amino acids of mature part 9 10 . the prepart is removed cotranslationally and formed procathepsin is translocated into golgi apparatus and then the 108asn and the 155asn in mature parts are glycosylated by high mannose type sugar as shown in figure 2a . cathepsin b is translated as 17 amino acids of prepart 62 amino acids of pro part and 252 amino acids of mature part 12 13 . as you see in figure 2 cathepsins b l and h have individual ordered nicking bond as the initiation of their degradations these bonds are cleaved by cysteine protease therefore as table 1 shows the half lives t12 of cathepsins and the contents in lysosomes clearly increased by treatment by e64 inhibitor for all cysteine proteases . the initiations of degradation of cathepsins are started from the ordered limited proteolysis by cysteine protease in the lysosomes as figure 2 shows . each cystatin shows different inhibitory specificity for individual cathepsins for example cystatin does not inhibit cathepsin b activity but strongly inhibit cathepsin l activity and cathepsin h activities 7 19 . the phosphorylated cystatin showed strong inhibition to cathepsin l but not to the cathepsin b and h it also showed strong inhibition to the bacterial cysteine proteases and virus cathepsins . as figure 8 shows n terminus of cystatins was inserted into the substrate binding pocket of cathepsins the glutathionated or the dimmer form were unable to insert into the binding pocket of cathepsins .", " endocrine disorders may complicate cause or mimic otolaryngologic disorders some of which may be anatomical due to an enlargement of the thyroid gland while others are physiological resulting from increased or decreased glandular activity.1 hypothyroidism is characterized by the slowing of mental and motor activity depression constipation cold intolerance menorrhagia stiff muscles carpal tunnel syndrome sleep apnea dry hair and skin weight gain snoring and a hoarse voice.1 less common symptoms involve the heart muscles joints and blood.2 dysarthria as the presenting symptom of hypothyroidism has only been reported once before.3 here we present an unusual case of hypo thyroidism presenting with dysarthria . dysarthria due to hypothyroidism had been reported only once previous to this case.3 the pathophysiology of dysarthria in hypothyroidism can be explained by edematous swelling of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal structures in combination with macroglossia.3 it has been shown that macroglossia in hypothyroidism is caused by a thickening of the epithelial tissue.6 these changes can also explain the choking and the dysphagia which this patient experienced . there have been a few reports of hypothyroidism responsible for secondary dysphagia.1012 her sleep apnea may also be a manifestation of hypothyroidism most likely caused by edema and myopathy.7 sleep apnea attributable to hypothyroidism is reversible with thyroxin replacement therapy.8 the episodic hoarseness of voice can also be explained by hypothyroidism1 as well as the delayed recovery from anaethesia the year before most probably the result of undiagnosed hypothyroidism.91314 unfortunately thyroid function tests had not been performed on our patient at that time . hypothyroidism as the cause of dysarthria was confirmed with the discovery of additional symptoms in the patient s history .", " pathologies of the biceps tendon can be broadly divided into two classes namely as follows . therefore varied anatomical knowledge of the bg is important as abnormalities of the bicipital tendon and its synovial sheath have been implicated in a variety of causes of shoulder pain and disability 6 7 . therefore varied anatomical knowledge of the bg is important as abnormalities of the bicipital tendon and its synovial sheath have been implicated in a variety of causes of shoulder pain and disability 6 7 . the narrowness and shallowness of bg have been redefined objectively in relation to dimensions of both bicipital groove and biceps tendon for adequate prediction of pathologies of biceps tendon . though the precise definition of narrowness shallowness of bg is difficult yet systematic relative and constrained definition depending on the dimensions of bicep tendon and its natural abode that is bicipital groove is formulated as follows.if the width of bg is less than the width of biceps tendon it is a narrow bg which may produce attritional changes causing impingement inflammation and degeneration . if the width of bg is less than the width of biceps tendon it is a narrow bg which may produce attritional changes causing impingement inflammation and degeneration . as the new definition of narrowness or shallowness requires the width and height of biceps tendon so the width and height of 4 biceps tendons from 2 cadavers have also been measured to provide more realistic definition of narrow shallow of bicipital groove . the width and height of biceps tendon figure 3 have been displayed in table 2 . observed this ridge in 88 on right side and 57 on left side and emphasised that it was more important on right side than left to prevent medial displacement of long head of biceps from the bg . in present study mean width and height of biceps tendon figure 3 are 10.5 and 1.6 mm respectively which is higher than that observed by lam and mok . if the tendon is not encased by median and lateral walls of bg due to its shallow depth it may be dislocated either partially or fully by biomechanical movements of arms . apart from this if the movements of tendon are not free in narrow or in presence of bony spurs in bg during biomechanical movements of shoulder joint its constant fraying might give rise to pathologies of biceps tendon . they found a significant accumulation of pathologically changed biceps tendons when a flat groove angle was present . according to several authors subluxation and dislocation of biceps tendon were more common in presence of shallow bicipital groove 1 4 5 7 39 . it is also reported that with shallow bicipital groove the tendon is susceptible to chronic trauma due to impingement by the overlying acromion rotator cuff and coracoacromial arch during shoulder movement . therefore present author has attempted reliable realistic and objective definition of shallowness of bg in relation to biceps tendon as given in section 2 of this paper . as per morphometric data table 3 of bg and biceps tendon as observed in two cadavers in the present study the groove is not shallow according to new definition of shallowness . figure 3 shows the biceps tendon and bg in a dissected cadaver wherein the biceps tendon is positioned and perfectly well protected in bg . the bg in this case is not shallow as seen in the above mentioned figure and the height of biceps tendon is less than depth of bg . in the present study the data of bg and biceps tendon observed from two cadavers do not indicate narrow bg as per new definition of narrowness and shallowness given in section 2 . instability of biceps tendon besides other factors may be attributed to length of medial lateral walls opening medial wall angles depending on width depth constituting shallowness of bg and presence of supratubercular ridge 37 40 41 . the implication of longer walls is expected to ensure greater stability to biceps tendon lying in the bicipital groove than the shorter walls during multidirectional biomechanical movements . if the instability of biceps tendon is studied in relation to lengths of bg most frequent value of length of walls may play a vital role in diagnostics of tendon instability or attritional damage . as the biceps tendon is enshrined in bg width may influence the pathology occurring in this tendon . in wider groove the tendon the morphometry of the bicipital groove in terms of length of media wall lateral wall length of bg width depth medial wall angle and opening angle has been elucidated with reference to north indian population.the data on morphometry of bg will be of utmost use for anatomist radiologists orthopaedic surgeons and physicians.the new definition of narrow shallow bg has been given .", " five of the world s most fatal work safety accidents in the past decade 20012010 occurred in china 1 . work safety accidents has become the first

shown but significant defects in sexual development fig . our previous study showed that the c terminal domains of both cop and cop are essential for their interaction and that the n terminal wd40 motif of cop and the tpr region of cop are involved in controlling the interaction between these two cops in a. nidulans . we also reported that a. nidulans cop can substitute for s. cerevisiae cop functions in vivo . therefore we investigated whether the phenotype of the sodc1 mutant was suppressed by over expression of anea in a. nidulans . to investigate the function of anea in development of a. nidulans the pattern of hyphal growth including radial growth septation and asexual sporulation were examined in one of the deletion mutant strains . these results indicated that cop is not essential for the viability of a. nidulans these results are similar to those obtained in yeasts . thermal stress which makes the cop defective yeast strain unviable showed no effect on viability and vegetative growth in the cop deletion strains data not shown . taken together these results show that cop in a. nidulans is neither essential for viability nor involved in stress responses unlike in

promote interactive decision making problem solving critical thinking and stress management skills and lead to more social acceptability which in turn reduce drug abuse tendency . it is recommended to plan and perform constant lst workshops as effective tools of drug abuse prevention in universities .", " in canada burnetii antibodies 5 . a study conducted in southern france showed that 5 to 8 of endocarditis cases in humans were due to c. burnetii and the prevalence of acute q fever was 50 cases per 100000 inhabitants 7 . in korea there is a little information concerning the epidemiology of c. burnetii infection in either animals or humans . a few cases of acute q fever in humans have been reported 9 10 . we examined the prevalence of antibodies to c. burnetii in dairy cattle nationwide and in people for health screening in a rural area of korea and used the data to evaluate the impact of q fever in both animals and humans in korea . this study examined the seroprevalence of c. burnetii infection in cattle and people for health screening in korea . burnetii antibodies with 75.5 of the positive sera having high titers 1256 . in neighboring japan the seroprevalence of c. burnetii in healthy cattle ranges from 2 to 46 in cattle with reproductive disorders the range was 60 to 84 6 . this is the first report to provide data that suggest that c. burnetii infection might be one of the important causes of reproductive problems in cattle in korea . since c. burnetii is widely distributed in wild animals and ticks and causes q fever to humans 1 3 it is necessary to evaluate the environmental hazards associated with c. burnetii infection that may threaten public health in the near future . the finding that people in a rural area demonstrated a relatively low seroprevalence of c. burnetii as well as lower titers suggests that infection with this microorganism seems to be relatively low in the rural area of korea . despite the low seroprevalence of c. burnetii in humans we can not exclude the risk of q fever to individuals with high risk occupations such as farmers veterinarians and meat processing workers considering the high rate of infection observed in cattle in this study . in conclusion c. burnetii appears to be a highly prevalent pathogen in cattle in korea and accordingly the studies on the high risk groups are needed to evaluate the seroprevalence for this organism in korea .", " diagnosis of pulmonary nocardiosis is dependent on the isolation or demonstration of the organism from respiratory secretions such as sputum or tissue specimens . the diagnosis of nocardiosis is currently based on direct examination and conventional culture serology is usually not useful . although nocardiosis is an uncommon illness co infection of this disease with tuberculosis has been reported 9 . the aim of this study was to assess the presence of nocardia spp . among the 157 outpatients 7.6 12157 of specimens had positive results for acid fast bacilli by acid fast staining but none of the samples were positive for nocardia spp . out of 157 samples 7 11157 were positive by pcr for mtbc and none of the samples was positive for nocardia by pcr . among 32 samples in hiv infected patients four 12.5 were culture positive for m. tuberculosis and none of them were positive for nocardia . out of these four samples two were positive for nocardia spp . based on our data the prevalence of nocardiosis and also concomitant infection with tuberculosis in our study was 6.25 232 in hiv infected patients and 1.05 2189 for all cases . among

6.25 232 in hiv infected patients and 1.05 2189 for all cases . as clinical manifestation of pulmonary tuberculosis and nocardiosis are similar laboratory tests are required in order to distinguish of nocardiosis from tuberculosis . as two samples were positive for nocardia spp . and mtbc using the pcr method it is suggested that concurrent pulmonary tuberculosis and nocardiosis may developed coincidently . some reports indicate that greater than two thirds of the patients diagnosed with pulmonary nocardiosis were initially diagnosed as having tuberculosis and about 5 of the patients with proven pulmonary tuberculosis were shown to have co infection with nocardia 18 . in this study nocardia was not distinguished in sputum specimens using conventional methods however positive samples were determined using the pcr assay . in iran several studies investigated pulmonary nocardiosis or tuberculosis in patients with various clinical symptoms . to the best of our knowledge this is the first study reporting co infection of nocardiosis and tuberculosis in hiv positive patients in iran . although nocardiosis resembles tuberculosis first line anti tuberculous drugs are not efficient for its treatment .", " using current localization techniques h mrs spectra can be obtained from regions of 1 10 l within the timescale of a clinical examination and this allows for the definition of spectral changes specific to the motor cortex 3 . early studies of h mrs in stroke have mostly investigated ischemic stroke and they have shown an increased lactate and decreased naa within the stroke lesion 4 6 . however attempts to determine whether the magnitude of neuronal damage as measured by naa loss correlates with the disability and impairment in ischemic stroke patients have brought forth inconsistent results 7 10 . there has been no previous h mrs study that has investigated the metabolic changes in the higher motor cortex following intracerebral hematoma in hemiparetic humans . these results showed that the naa cr ratios of the ah were significantly decreased when compared with those of the uh and normal volunteers and therefore the metabolic changes had occurred in the high cortical region ipsilateral to the injured hemispheres . however the naa cr ratios of m1 in the ah showed no significant correlation with the severity of arm weakness leg weakness or the duration of hemiparesis . one of the most important contributions of h mrs to clinical neuroscience is its ability to quantify neuronal loss and to demonstrate reversible neuronal damage 1 2 . h mrs has been used in attempting better qualification of the brain damage caused by stroke . initially it was suggested that decrease in naa represented neuronal loss 18 however a reversible decrease in naa has recently been shown to occur for acute lesions in multiple sclerosis and in stroke like episodes of melas 19 . early studies of h mrs for stroke have shown increased lactate and decreased naa within the stroke lesion 4 6 . subsequent attempts have been made to determine whether the magnitude of neuronal damage as measured by the naa loss from the infarcted region correlated with the disability and impairment in stroke patients . 21 has pointed out that the above mentioned studies regarding h mrs and outcome after stroke measured the naa loss from the center of infarcted region and thus these naa losses were not representative of the total neuronal injury . to examine the relationship between naa loss after stroke and motor outcome the researchers studied naa levels in the posterior limb of the internal capsule which contains the descending motor pathways for patients with motor deficits secondary to a cortical subcortical or capsular stroke . in that study they found that mean internal capsule naa was significantly lower in the patient group and axonal injury in the descending motor pathways at the level of internal capsule correlated with motor deficit for patients after stroke . they suggested a possible anterograde axonal injury might have an important role for this naa loss in strokes involving the internal capsule and the motor and subcortex areas that contains the motor pathway 21 . furthermore only a few researchers have used h mrs for the detection of biochemical changes in the motor and motor association areas following the subordinate motor pathway damage 3 23 . however reduced levels of naa in normal appearing white matter have already been shown to occur in those patients with multiple sclerosis and cerebral ischemia that has caused motor stroke 21 24 . 21 studied eighteen ischemic strokes that caused motor deficit with the use of h mrs and they have shown that cortical and subcortical stroke induced naa loss in the normal appearing internal capsule . the reduction of the naa cr ratios in the m1 cortex in our study seems to be concordant with the already documented reduction of rcbf in the sensorimotor cortex by the pet study of recovered ischemic capsular infarction 25 . 3 evaluated the motor cortex by using in vivo h mrs in patients with incomplete spinal cord injury who showed a good motor function recovery . in that report the mean level of the naa cr ratio was significantly elevated in the motor cortex of patients as compared with their ipsilateral occipital cortex or the cortical area of controls . at first glance this increased naa cr value in the motor cortex of the recovered incomplete spinal cord injury study seems to be contrary to our observations of decreased naa cr values in the ah motor cortex with hemiparesis . at this time it is not clear whether the naa cr ratio of the ah would increase according to the recovery from hemiparesis in intracerebral hematoma . in our present study we found a significant reduction of the naa cr ratios in both the ah and uh as compared with the normal controls . in summary we sought to determine whether h mrs is able to detect the metabolic changes of the m1 and sma that follow pyramidal tract injury after intracerebral hemorrhage . we found that the m1 in the ah has lower naa cr values than in the m1 in the uh and in normal volunteers . in addition the sma also showed bilateral lower naa cr values in both the ah and uh than in normal volunteers . though we can not precisely document the exact meaning of these lower naa cr ratios a presumed retrograde degeneration or functional deactivation may play a role in these naa losses in m1 and sma due to motor tract injury .", " she was observed to have reduced sleep since 1 week before her exams and had relatively less communication with family members . on the day of her exams by the time she got the question paper her whole of her right arm started having repetitive flickering movement vigorously and she had to support her right arm with the left to write the exam and had come out of exam hall without completing the exam . within a few days the abnormal movements had progressed to her right leg . she was treated with promethazine and trihexyphenidyl neuroimaging was done which was found to be normal . she showed some improvement after 20 days but she was not completely resolved on the day before the day of admission she developed shivering over her whole body and was admitted to the intensive care unit . her episodes were provoked when asked to write or hold a pen with her right hand also when she was asked to walk without assistance . she was also observed to flex her right toe while walking and during stay in the hospital she was observed to be having a sudden onset of asymmetrical repetitive jerky movements of bilateral legs . on the initial days of sessions her symptoms got aggravated during the sessions and session had to be stopped in

2006 to july 2011 134 eyes from 132 patients who underwent agv implantation surgery at kim s eye hospital were analyzed retrospectively . each subject underwent a full ophthalmic examination including

interactive threshold algorithm standard automated visual fieldest humphrey visual field analyzer carl zeiss meditec dublin ca usa before surgery as well as 1 day 1 month 2 3 months 4 6 months 11 16 months and 17 24 months after surgery . the study included any patient who underwent agv implantation surgery at kim s eye hospital performed using the same technique by 1 of 2 glaucoma specialists yhs and hkk with a minimum of 6 months follow up . the exclusion criteria were patients age less than 18 years or more than 80 years agv implanted in inferior quadrants previous seton surgery or trabeculectomy in the operated eye inflammatory or ocular surface disease with severe conjunctival scarring history of retinal detachment surgery with scleral buckle or vitrectomy in the operated eye and history of endophthalmitis in the operated eye . the agv implantation selection was made by the surgeon based on conjunctival mobility and presence of previous surgical conjunctival scaring

consecutive follow up visits additional glaucoma surgery was required and loss of light perception . to compare the success rate of surgery between the 2 groups a log rank mantel cox test was performed among them 66 eyes underwent fp7 implant surgery and 24 eyes underwent fp8 implant surgery . in this study surgical success was considered as iop maintained at less than 21 mmhg regardless of the medication used no additional glaucoma surgery required non occurrence of light sense loss and no consecutive follow up visits with low iop . these results are in agreement with the present study results no differences were found in vision preservation iop reduction or decrease in number of glaucoma medications between the fp7 and fp8 agv implants in adult eyes with glaucoma . thus far this is the only study comparing the surgical outcomes between fp7 and fp8 agv implants in adult eyes . in adult eyes however in conditions with conjunctival scarring or limited subconjunctival space fp7 agv implantation is challenging . given that fp7 and fp8 agv implants did not show differences in surgical outcomes we suggest that fp8 implantation may be a useful surgical option for iop control in adult eyes with insufficient conjunctival or subconjunctival areas . in conclusion fp7 and fp8 agv implants showed no difference in terms of preservation of vision iop reduction or decrease in the number of required glaucoma medications . the fp8 agv implant appears to be a viable option for the management of refractory glaucoma in adult eyes with conjunctival scarring or limited subconjunctival space owing to the previous ocular surgeries inflammatory ocular disorders or small eyes .", " a precise fit between an implant abutment and a superstructure determining the absence of bone tension without the occlusal load is an important factor for the long term success of implant supported restorations . the use of such abutments allows correction in angulations for implants inserted at angles other than ideal . there has been concern as to whether the use of these custom made abutments would result in fit of the abutment to the implant that could be comparable to that achieved with use of premachined titanium abutments . these hand operated devices have been developed to correct casting defects in the fitting surface and reduce the abutment implant misfit . despite various prosthetic and technical improvements laboratory procedures used in the fabrication of implant supported prostheses especially casting and porcelain baking this study evaluated the effect of cast rectifiers on the misfit of cast ucla abutments compared to premachined ucla abutments . during this process implant analogues were joined to the abutments to reduce the risk of damage to the abutment implant interface figure 1b . there was significant reduction of the marginal misfit of cast ucla abutments from 25.68 m to 14.83 m . after ceramic application m3 the cast abutments presented marginal misfit mean 16.18 m statistically similar to that observed for the premachined abutments at the same interval 14.3 m . casting of the premachined ucla abutments control group m2 altered significantly the marginal misfit of these components from 9.63 m to 14.6 m . the use of this prosthetic option has increased even though the fit at the abutment to implant interface is not as satisfactory as the fit provided by premachined abutments319 . this device is a manual instrument designed to minimize the marginal misfit of cast ucla abutments leading to a better mechanical stability of the assembly and reducing the probability of bacterial aggregation . the use of cast rectifiers led to a significant reduction of marginal misfit of cast ucla abutments with a reduction of marginal misfit means from 25.68 m to 14.83 m . the cast abutments used in the present study after the use of rectifiers and porcelain baking m3 exhibited a mean marginal misfit of16.18 m which was statistically equivalent to the mean observed for premachined components at the same interval 14.3 m . in disagreement with the findings of vigolo et al.20 2000 the present investigation demonstrated that for the group of premachined abutments even with the carefully conducted laboratory steps significant changes occurred at the implant abutment interface during the casting process with an increase in the mean marginal gap from 9.63 to 14.6 m . use of rectifiers in cast ucla abutments reduced significantly the marginal misfit at the implant abutment interface 2 . even with carefully performed laboratory steps changes at implant interface of premachined ucla abutments occurred 3 .", " diabetic neuropathy is a leading complication of diabetes mellitus resulting in significant morbidity and mortality . although its exact pathogenesis is not fully understood hyperglycemia does not appear to be the sole factor in the development of neuropathy in diabetic patients . enigmatically recent reports have described that long term tight glycemic control may be a major risk factor for the development of diabetic neuropathy 1 2 . neuropathy secondary to rapid normalization of chronic hyperglycemia in the setting of poorly controlled diabetes is also emerging as a new disease entity classified as an iatrogenic complication . currently the only available method for preventing this hypoglycemia induced neuronal injury in the clinical setting is the delivery of glucose a treatment that paradoxically may exacerbate the insult . the objective of this present research was to study the molecular mechanisms of acute neuropathic pain induced by insulin and hypoglycemia in an animal model . while cba caj mice spontaneously develop mild hyperglycemia these mice had not yet developed peripheral neuropathy at the commencement of the study as assessed by mechanical testing . to examine the effects of acute insulin induced hypoglycemia on mechanical sensitivity 1 unit kg of insulin novolin novo nordisk 2880 bagsvrd denmark was injected intraperitoneally in the treatment group while control animals received equal volumes of normal saline . compared to control animals it appeared that decreased blood glucose levels correlated to increased pain in the insulin treatment group . for the scenario of insulin induced hypoglycemia we evaluated whether coq10 could play a protective role in the peripheral nerves . studies have suggested that hypoglycemia induced neuropathy may not simply be the result of glucose deprivation but rather a result of a multifactorial process involving oxidative stress and stress sensitive factors . the results of the present study demonstrate that insulin induced hypoglycemia may result in acute neuropathic pain and the increased mechanical sensitivity noted is the result of decreased glycemic levels rather than insulin itself . the immunohistological and rt pcr results suggest that insulin induced hypoglycemia results in an increased expression of the stress sensitive and pain related factor c fos in nerve tissues . studies estimate 30 of diabetics experience serious hypoglycemic episodes annually and hypoglycemia has potentially devastating effects on nervous tissues . our data demonstrated that when combined glucose and insulin injections without subsequent hypoglycemic episodes do not result in acute painful neuropathy suggesting that insulin itself does not induce hypoglycemia induced mechanical hypersensitivity . thus acute painful neuropathy is a concern not only for diabetics but also for normal subjects experiencing sudden hypoglycemic episodes . as we have demonstrated hypoglycemia itself may exacerbate neuropathy and currently the only available method for preventing this hypoglycemia induced neuronal injury in the clinical setting is the delivery of glucose a treatment that paradoxically may exacerbate the insult .", " as early as 1981 the san francisco department of public health dph began to coordinate efforts to plan and develop services to respond to the health care needs of growing numbers of persons with aids pwa s in the city most of whom were and are homosexual bisexual males . in late 1982 a multidisciplinary aids outpatient clinic was established at san francisco general hospital sfgh to provide screening diagnosis treatment followup education and counseling services . in addition private physicians in fee for service practice community hospitals the kaiser hospital and the permanente medical group have become increasingly involved in the care of pwa s . the response to the aids epidemic of both the public and private sectors in san francisco has generated a range of medical social psychological housing and other services to meet the needs of pwa s . somewhat paradoxically the success of san francisco in developing a range of services to address this complex of aids care needs has produced a new set of problems for planners and program managers namely how to manage the care of pwa s across providers in appropriate responsive and cost effective ways morrison 1988 . this need to better manage the delivery of health and social services is exacerbated by two other characteristics of aids 1 the likelihood of precipitous changes in physical and emotional status throughout the course of the illness resulting in frequent changes in care needs and 2 the increased incidence of neurological and psychosocial problems further broadening the range and complexity of care needs . like many communities that have had to confront the aids epidemic san francisco has devoted increased attention to development of case management services for pwa s in order to plan and monitor care throughout the course of the illness benjamin 1988 . despite the widespread equation of case management with the san francisco model of aids care the emergence of formal case management as a public policy priority in san francisco has been a relatively recent development . in the early years of the epidemic hospital discharge planning at sfgh where more than one half of the aids population received acute care was a central and the most formal part of this informal case management network . second a cadre of medical and social service professionals dedicated to aids care emerged rapidly in the city and this group shared a philosophy regarding the importance of home and community based services and the need to help pwa s negotiate this network of services . seventh the city itself is small and compact so that despite the growing aids caseload there was a small number of core providers among them sfgh shanti the visiting nurse association and hospice of san francisco the san francisco aids foundation and the aids health project that offered services to most pwa s and were well known to one another thus facilitating informal planning and management across agencies over time . as more community hospitals including the kaiser hospital physicians home care agencies and other providers became involved with aids care informal approaches to case coordination became much more difficult . growth in the number of intravenous drug users and homeless among persons with aids although still small proportionally along with the expanded number of cases with central nervous system involvement increased the complexity of the mainly white homosexual bisexual male caseload in the city and demanded more experienced and less episodic attention to the service needs of pwa s than was available from volunteers . the case of sfgh which currently provides excellent care to about one third of the inpatient and outpatient pwa s in the city illustrates both the strengths and limits of current case management efforts . because the hospital currently utilizes 40 or more acute care beds for aids patients and provides 2000 outpatient visits per month however sustained case management activities must be limited primarily to the acute episode and its immediate aftermath rather than to the entire period of illness . one of the goals of case management at sfgh at kaiser and at the community hospitals is to reduce the utilization of inpatient care through the planning and coordination of care provided outside the hospital . in the early years of the epidemic hospital discharge planning at sfgh where more than one half of the aids population received acute care was a central and the most formal part of this informal case management network . second a cadre of medical and social service professionals dedicated to aids care emerged rapidly in the city and this group shared a philosophy regarding the importance of home and community based services and the need to help pwa s negotiate

however sustained case management activities must be limited primarily to the acute episode and its immediate aftermath rather than to the entire period of illness . the department of public health in san francisco received a demonstration grant in 1986 from the office of aids california department of health services to provide home care and case management services to a small number of pwa s . the case management program for which additional funding has been sought from the state office of aids is designed to establish a case management capacity in the city dph that is expected to serve pwa s referred from sfgh district health centers community hospitals including kaiser physicians in private practice community and government agencies family members and friends and self referrals . the proposed program will initially support two case management teams each of which will follow 40 aids arc patients from the time of initial inpatient admission or referral through the course of the illness . the experience of san francisco in organizing and managing the delivery of aids care leaves various questions unanswered regarding case management system design and financing . although san francisco has embraced what has come to be known as a brokering model of case management under which case management involves gaining access to and coordinating existing services communities with fewer available aids services have adopted a direct service model wright sklebar and heiman 1987 in which case managers not only plan for care but directly provide those services not otherwise available to pwa s . case management in san francisco and many other communities has been designed primarily to address the needs of the largest subpopulation of pwa s in those locales i.e. demonstration and waiver programs in new jersey new york and a few cities with large numbers of ivdu aids cases may cast light on the elements of case management appropriate to this aids population . without additional funding for such services and most significantly long term care services as the number of aids cases grows and the fiscal burden of aids care on governments especially local ones increases it is important also to recognize that funding for indirect services like case management are likely to be reduced before that for harder direct services . in many cities where aids lengths of stay are twice or more those of san francisco planners remain hopeful nonetheless that the introduction of case management will reduce dependence on inpatient care through the coordinated use of outpatient home and community services . although many factors besides case management explain the shorter length of stay in san francisco scitovsky cline and lee 1986 arno and hughes 1987 there remains reason to believe that in other communities aids may prove the exception to prior findings on the limited impact of case management by demonstrating that these services can shorten hospital stays and thus reduce the overall costs of caring for persons with aids .", " adipose tissue is a key regulator of energy balance playing an active role in lipid storage and buffering synthesizing and

synthesis although lipogenesis in this tissue is considered low and less than that in the liver . excessive hepatic lipogenesis is a hallmark feature of many models of obesity and diabetes although the causal relationship between tissue lipid accumulation and insulin resistance is unclear . it is well recognized that adipose tissue storage capacity for fatty acids prevents lipotoxicity in other tissues . however adipose tissue buffering is impaired in obesity through defects in the ability of adipose tissue to respond rapidly . thus the lipogenic pathway has been suggested to be downregulated in obesity at least at the gene expression level . although in early obesity there is an increase in lipogenic gene expression to store fat rapidly in long term obese subjects this expression decreases perhaps due to a late adaptive process aimed at limiting further development of fat mass . thus changes in lipid storing capacity and lipid mobilization processes in adipocytes represent important elements of adipose tissue dysfunction . the activation of ppar leads to adipocyte differentiation and fatty acid storage whilst it represses genes that induce lipolysis and the release of free fatty acids ffa in adipocytes . failure in the metabolism of this molecule leads to dysregulation in the optimal lipid storage and mobilization the main problem of obesity . so from this point concerning carbohydrate metabolism disorders and obesity we have demonstrated that adipose fasn gene expression is closely related with the hyperglycemic state higher in normoglycemic individuals compared with those with hyperglycemia . we have suggested that the adipose tissue and the liver may act in a balanced manner depending on the ir status as a decrease in fabp4 expression was observed in adipose tissue from metabolically obese patients versus metabolically healthy humans while the opposite takes place in the liver with an increase in fabp4 expression in metabolically obese patients with the ir status being an important determinant in tissue expression . this suggests that ror1 may be added to the list of nuclear receptors in adipose tissue that could be used to modulate the ir associated with obesity . this participation in the regulation of lipid processing in adipose tissue takes place under both normal and pathological conditions . this is supported by findings from our laboratory showing an increased brca1 expression in adipose tissue and during adipogenesis that mirror the effects of lipogenic enzymes such as acetyl coa carboxylase acc and fasn . thus taking together the increased expression of the brca1 gene and the reduced expression of many lipogenic factors could be interpreted as the process through which cells reduce their ability to synthesize additional fatty acids once the limit in the storage capacity of the adipocytes is attained . adipocytes are the main units in adipose tissue and this tissue is considered to control the whole body metabolism so dysregulation can have huge consequences for health . lipid excess in at results in increased adipocyte size hypertrophy or and increased numbers of adipocytes hyperplasia seen as enlarged sat or vat figure 2 . allowing adipose tissue to store more lipids may prevent secondary metabolic complications caused by lipids being deposited in nonadipose organs . thus the ability of adipose tissue to expand and match the storage needs of energy surplus may be a key determinant in protection against the metabolic syndrome associated with obesity . it is therefore very important to understand the signaling factors that control adipose tissue expansion . nevertheless new factors have been discovered that induce adipogenesis such as thyroid hormone responsive spot 14 thrsp or s14 another specific factor whose gene expression and protein levels in lipogenic tissues are strongly linked to glucose thyroid hormone insulin and glucose and that is directly associated with adipogenesis in human adipocytes but inversely related to obesity and omental fat accumulation . in summary despite a potential genetic disposition to force the adipogenic cell fate by the upregulation of ppar the combination of dysregulated genes mainly members of notch and shh foxa2 and foxc2 inhibitors of adipogenic differentiation and mirnas mirna23b and mir27b which are ppar and cebp repressors and wnt activators and mir103 mirna542 5p and mirna320 involved in wnt dependent inhibition of adipogenesis among others may cause a block inducing a failure to enter andor progress to the adipogenic fate . the dysregulation of this process has been suggested to contribute to obesity differences in regional fat distribution or lipodystrophy . these phenomena could be as a consequence of obesity induced inflammation thus we linked these results with a state of ir as these changes were paralleled by an increase in gene expression of inflammatory cytokines tnf and il6 and macrophage infiltration markers . this reduction in ppar also reduces adipocyte differentiation consistent with the study of bernardi et al . adipose tissue is highly vascularized and each adipocyte is nourished by an extensive capillary network . in this work we have focused on the pathologies associated with an adipose tissue failure from a molecular approach but this is only a tiny part of the story . however it has been noticed that morbidly obese patients have this process endangered in the same way that occurs with caspases and bcl2 proteins or tweak and trail concerning to apoptosis or with the vegf family in the case of angiogenesis which are also deregulated in morbidly obese patients and to the increase of fat . at present many other hypotheses have been developed trying to explain the causes of the adipose tissue hypertrophy and hyperplasia . during obesity the enlargement of the vascular network is not sufficient to supply enough oxygen to all adipocytes and local hypoxia occurs and this hypoxia could be a key trigger of adipose tissue dysfunction .", " alp is an unusual but life threatening complication of sle and usually presents with the acute onset of fever cough tachypnea and hypoxia . ipso and alp occurring in a single patient described as co manifestation with sle has not been reported previously . herein we report a case in which ipso was the initial presentation of sle and secondary onset of alp occurred after emergency surgery . for 10 days the patient demonstrated clinical improvement abdominal pain was relieved and the patient experienced no chills nausea or vomiting and vital signs were stable and was discharged . however the patient had sudden onset of fever 40.4c and dyspnea oxygen saturation sao2 was 87 and arterial blood gas analysis revealed a ph of 7.409 pco2 33.6 mmhg and po2 83.9 mmhg . alp was finally diagnosed and high dose 1 g day methylprednisolone gamma globulin therapy was administered . the present study presents a rare case in which ipso was the initial presentation of sle with secondary onset of alp after emergency surgery . to the best of our knowledge there have been no previous reports of ipso and alp occurring in a single patient . as in the present case the clinical manifestations of ipso include abdominal pain nausea vomiting absence of bowel sounds and may include constipation and fever 4 . ipso may be the first manifestation of sle in some patients however it usually represents a complication with few case series described in the literature 1210 . alp is an uncommon 112 manifestation but may be a life threatening complication of sle 12 . the clinical features of alp are characterized by acute onset of fever cough pleurisy and dyspnea . alp was finally diagnosed by the syndrome of acute reversible hypoxemia the abnormal results of ct scan and the exclusion of other causes of lung infiltration . in the present case although the sledai score was 10 alp occurred which may be explained by the emergency surgery performed for ipso . in conclusion we report the first case of alp and ipso co existing in a patient with sle .", " military personnel face multiple stressors in their lives.12 studies have reported that stress occurs from risky assignments or missions35 the demand for physical fitness problems in interactions with peers and those of higher rank6 sleep deprivation from shift work78 deployment and separation from family9 and additional noncombat work assignments such as disaster relief peacekeeping and other humanitarian actions.10 home front problems with spouses and children also have an impact on the lives of military personnel.91112 global defense budget cuts and the downsizing of military manpower increase the workload and stress of the few remaining military personnel.1315 the world health organization s who definition of health includes physical mental and social aspects.16 quality of life qol in the context of individual cultural and subcultural systems is associated with personal goals expectations standards and values.17 the who has advocated for the goals of promotion of quality of life preservation of function and well being as well as prolongation of peoples lives.18 the who quality of life instrument whoqol and its brief version whoqol bref are commonly used scales for use among general populations as well as among disease specific populations.19 the mental and physical health of military personnel may vary as a result of different administrative characteristic and political factors.20 the identification of stressors in military life as well as the factors that influence health would enable us to provide proper care for military personnel . therefore the relationship between quality of life qol and perceived health are crucial for the maintenance of the welfare of military personnel and troop strength . the aim of this study was to evaluate military personnel from select branches of ground forces in taiwan for their perceived health status and qol . one way analysis of variance was also used to analyze the differences in chq and qol between different ranks levels of education groups of mandatory or voluntary military services . multiple regression analysis was used to identify significant variables associated with chq qol and vas of subjective health condition in the past 2 weeks . the discriminant validity effectively distinguished healthy from unhealthy people and accounted for 60 of the total qol.24 the vas method is widely used to assess the status of a patient s pain or illness.2627 it is a cost effective way to evaluate a patient s health.2829 the scores range from 0 the worst to 100 the best and they indicate subjective health over the previous 2 weeks and before the participants entered military service . one way analysis of variance was also used to analyze the differences in chq and qol between different ranks levels of education groups of mandatory or voluntary military services . multiple regression analysis was used to identify significant variables associated with chq qol and vas of subjective health condition in the past 2 weeks . we collected 720 useable questionnaires from service members in the army n297 41.3 air force n59 8.2 gendarme n197 27.4 and other participants n167 23.1 . the officers had a higher score on the vas of self reported health 72.5 than did the ncos 67.7 or enlisted men 66.3 p0.001 but only for the previous 2 weeks . as shown in table 1 officers had lower chq scores 9.62 than did ncos 11.07 and enlisted men 11.51 . when we used a score of 9 as the cut off point set as the three quarter cut off point22 and considered subjects reporting 10 or more points as unhealthy chq cases or as cases where there was psychological morbidity the officers had a higher percentage of good health 57.4 than did the ncos 38.5 or enlisted men 42.2 . on item 4 limb tremor or numbness and item 5 poor sleep quality the enlisted men s scores of 1.62 and 2.48 respectively were higher than those of officers scores of 1.43 and 2.04 respectively . other significant data showed that older personnel had better health value 0.0033 or 0.967 and smokers accounted for more psychological morbidity in higher chq scores value 0.377 or 1.458 table 3 . vas scores for self reported health also revealed significant differences between the chq cases and the non chq cases . in this cross sectional study the qol and chq scores and their interactions were analyzed in different military branches ranks and service types voluntary or obligatory enlisted personnel . a total of 55.3 of all these subjects reported themselves as being unhealthy on the chq this was higher than in the general population as rates of 1833 were reported in different samples.3034 among our subjects the ncos and enlisted men rated themselves as having poor health 61.5 and 57.8 respectively . in table 5 we have reviewed several previously selected studies conducted among different military and nonmilitary populations . in mobilized military personnel the nature of military stress rather than age or other demographic data for example combat related deployments peacekeeping or disaster relief actions or outbreaks of infectious diseases354147 is most likely to be related to psychological morbidity and poor quality of life . in the peace time contrarily41 and among the general population4849 age may play a role in contributing to psychological morbidity and poor qol in one study that was conducted from a military hospital in two other studies conducted in the general population.41 in previous studies conducted among students5052 which had a similar age distribution as that of the present study the ghq rates varied from 2952 and were higher in the female sex among subjects experiencing stressful events those with a basic level of training those with academic problems and family social economic status . the reason may be that those with higher ranks in the military are often older than ncos and enlisted men however among enlisted men age still played a role as most of the subjects rating themselves as healthy were older than those not rating themselves as such 0.160 p0.013 . the vas of self reported health a subjective and overall scale for health status was lower in ncos and enlisted men and higher in officers . in the analysis of the subitems on the chq ncos had more headaches and sleep problems than did officers and the enlisted men had more limb numbness and sleep problems than did officers . in each domain of qol officers had better scores than did enlisted men in terms of general qol physical symptoms concentration daily energy levels physical pain sleep sex life appearance leisure activities capacity for work money respect a chq question and food a chq question . the vas of self reported health might be a useful tool for screening military mental health .", " it was reported that athletes who perform weight loss before competitions undergo not only change their hydration status but also experience health problems such as sleep disorders learning and memory difficulties anxiety depression irregular body temperature vasoconstriction low sexual performance and dysfunctions in skeletal muscles12 . there are studies in literature of dehydration skeletal muscle damage and inflammation among elite wrestlers222324 . accordingly the present study aimed to identify weight loss and hydration levels before competitions among elite wrestlers and explore skeletal muscle damage and inflammation levels after dehydration . trainers and athletes will benefit from information on skeletal muscle damage and inflammation levels caused by dehydration . the wrestlers who underwent fast weight loss had higher levels of posm 296.053.14 above the upper limit of reference value over 290 and suffered from dehydration . when intergroup hydration indicators were assessed it was found that the na bun

results in dehydration among the athletes by affecting their hydration levels negatively . the level of posm of the wrestlers who underwent fast weight loss was above the reference range upper limit 290 296.053.14 and they suffered dehydration of 4.55 . serum na and bun levels were higher among the dehydrated wrestlers due to the increase in posm but no differences were seen in their glucose values table 1 . differences in na and bun values affect posm values of the athletes and change their hydration status . the differences between the hydration levels and the skeletal muscle damage was determined according to the classification of casa et al . under normal conditions these elevated levels may be tolerated by the athletes with nutritional and relaxation programs but among the dehydrated athletes metabolism consumes low levels of carbohydrate due to food and fluid restrictions and uses an energy combination of fat and proteins thus glucose inhibition occurring with high plasma and free fat acids suggest that the damage to the muscles of the wrestlers would continue40 41 . among the dehydrated wrestlers the high level of serum ck would have affected their performance negatively as well as restricted their movements because of muscle pains . therefore it is our opinion that the high level of skeletal muscle damage among the dehydrated wrestlers was caused by food and fluid restriction following exercises . fast andor higher levels of weight loss before a competition produced differences in wrestlers hydration indicator levels . damage in skeletal muscles of the dehydrated wrestlers was greater than in those hydrated but no difference was found in the inflammation levels of the groups .", " there are only few reports in the literature describing postoperative outcome of spinal meningiomas 10 14 . one patient with psammomatous cervical meningioma with frankel grade c had severe grade b signs after surgery . from 8 patients who were unable to walk group b or c five cases remained at the same status group b or c postoperatively from which two cases were psammomatous and three cases were who grade ii meningioma . when comparing surgical outcome between different histologic subtypes we observed that 6 out of 15 patients with psammomatous meningioma 40 had worsened results or persistent functional deficit of grade c or worse . all of five cases of who grade ii meningioma worsened after surgery or remained unchanged in grade c. these are significantly different from remaining 19 cases of who grade i meningioma non psammomatous all of which 100 showed improved results or not changed post operatively remaining in grade d or e p 0.003 and p 001 tables 3 and 4 . in our study spinal meningiomas constitute 7.7 of cns meningiomas this could be due to the fact that shohada hospital is a referral center for difficult cases of spinal tumor surgery . psammomatous subtype and grade ii cases had poor postoperative outcome while the other subtypes of who grade i had good outcome in our study . since 80 of the incompletely removed tumors of the first group are of psammomatous subtype it seems that incomplete removal of the tumor may be the reason of poor outcome in psammomatous subtype in comparison with other subtypes of who grade i although further studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm this result . spinal meningioma of who grade i with psammomatous subtype are associated with less favorable postoperative neurologic outcome than other subtypes with results closer to cases of who grade ii . incomplete resection of spinal meningioma occurs more frequently in psammomatous subtype and cases of who grade ii and trying to complete resection may cause additional neurological damage . psammomatous subtype and grade ii cases had poor postoperative outcome while the other subtypes of who grade i had good outcome in our study . since 80 of the incompletely removed tumors of the first group are of psammomatous subtype it seems that incomplete removal of the tumor may be the reason of poor outcome in psammomatous subtype in comparison with other subtypes of who grade i although further studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm this result . spinal meningioma of who grade i with psammomatous subtype are associated with less favorable postoperative neurologic outcome than other subtypes with results closer to cases of who grade ii . incomplete resection of spinal meningioma occurs more frequently in psammomatous subtype and cases of who grade ii and trying to complete resection may cause additional neurological damage .", " previous studies also provided evidence that free extracellular dna is highly increased in cf airway specimen initially referred to as dna derived from necrotic cells . in this study we investigated cf airway inflammation with a focus on the abundance of free dna structures characteristic for nets in different airway specimen sputum and bal obtained from patients with cf and enac transgenic enac tg mice with cf like lung disease 2628 and correlated dna levels with proinflammatory cxc chemokines characteristic cf pathogens and measurements of lung function . our results demonstrate that free airway dna levels correlate with obstructive lung disease and proinflammatory chemokines in cf patients and cf mice and could serve as therapeutic target and potential biomarker in cf lung disease . increased extracellular dna fibres with morphological net characteristics were found in airway specimen from cf patients figures 1a and 1b . positive costaining for neutrophil elastase figure 1a and citrullinated histones figures 1a 1b and 1d as characteristic net markers and negative staining for f actin figure 1d supported the notion that the cf airway dna fibres represented nets rather than necrosis derived dna . free dna was present in different cf airway compartments in particular in sputum figure 1a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid bal figure 1c lower panel and lung tissue figure 1c upper panel . remarkably most abundant free dna was found in cf sputa whereas in bal and lung tissue lower amounts of free dna strands were detected which is consistent with the observation that neutrophilic inflammation is most prominent in the proximal bronchial airway compartments in cf lung disease . in cf airway fluids we found dna net like structures associated with bacteria figure 1e . these findings provide evidence that cf lung disease features free airway dna levels characteristic for netosis and suggest that increased free dna levels are associated with poor lung function of cf patients . to investigate the role of free dna net formation in vivo we used transgenic mice with airway specific overexpression of the amiloride sensitive epithelial na channel enac tg as a model of cf like lung disease 26 27 . also consistent with the data obtained from human cf lung disease samples the extent of free dna in murine cf airway fluids correlated positively with the levels of the cxcr2 ligand cxcl2 figure 3c and with pulmonary obstruction parameters fev100 figure 3d whereas no correlation was found between free dna and levels of cxcl1 or parameters of pulmonary restriction parameters data not shown . we and others have demonstrated previously that free dna net like structures are abundantly detectable in cf airway secretions 1014 . here we confirm and extend these previous observations by showing that cf airway free dna levels correlate with pulmonary obstruction in cf patients and mice . these observations are reasonable given the continuous and nonresolving neutrophil recruitment and activation within cf airways being supported by the beneficial effect of recombinant inhaled dnase dornase alpha in cf patients with the strongest evidence in moderate and severe disease severity 4446 . based on the increasing extent of neutrophilic inflammation and pulmonary obstruction the evidence of free net like dna structures in cf airways tempts us to speculate that in earlier and milder stages of cf lung disease net formation may act beneficial in providing extracellular antibacterial and antifungal host defense . on the other hand in later moderate to severe stages of cf lung disease the amount of mucus and dna accumulation causes airway obstruction rendering dnase efficient in cleaving dna traps and this effect probably overweighs the antimicrobial actions of net formation a hypothesis that awaits to be tested in further in vivo studies and clinical trials . our correlations between free dna levels and pulmonary obstruction parameters in human patients with cf and a mouse model of cf lung disease suggest that at least in our cf cohort with a more advanced lung disease severity nets may cause more harm than good to the host . the obvious limitations of our study and the whole approach of free dna analysis in cf airway fluids remain that the free extracellular dna could result from different forms of cell death in addition to netosis including necrosis pyroptosis and others . at single cell level authors also showed that neutrophils from cf patients had no cell intrinsic alteration in net formation supporting the notion that the net accumulation found in cf airway fluids is not specific to cftr mutation based disease conditions but rather represent a prototypical picture of severe and chronic neutrophilic inflammation in a body compartment . previous studies found a correlation between airway dna levels neutrophilic inflammation and lung function parameters in cf patients 9 57 58 . our study confirms and extends these findings by showing a correlation between free dna levels with lung function chemokine levels and fungal colonization in cf patients . the correlation between the neutrophil chemokine cxcl2 and free dna levels in cf airway fluids could on one hand reflect increased cxcl2mediated neutrophil chemotaxis or could also on the other hand involve cxcl2 itself as potential trigger for dna release in neutrophils . in summary our study in line with previous investigations demonstrates that free dna with net like characteristics represents an extracellular component of cf airway fluids .", " previous studies focused on the role of fathers in reducing the experience of parenting stress among mothers because traditionally they are mothers closest companions8 9 . thus the objective of this study was to examine a novel concept regarding the role of fathers by investigating the relationship between

presented to us with complaints of asymptomatic nodular skin lesions all over the body of 10 years duration . at the age of 20 years he started developing few small skin colored lesions on the

the timed up and go test time and the functional reach distance11 in the elderly . it is also known that the vertical ground reaction force during walking is affected by aging . elderly people exhibit lower first peak and second peak forces and a higher minimum value at mid stance than young people12 . the vertical ground reaction force provides correlative information about the ability to walk of elderly people . moreover if elderly people exhibit an age related alteration in support moment of the lower extremity changes in joint moment may affect the magnitude of the vertical ground reaction force . by analyzing the relationships between vertical ground reaction force and lower extremity joint moments it would be possible to clarify the difference in the support strategies of elderly and young people . therefore the purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between the vertical ground reaction force and the hip knee and ankle joint moments during walking by the elderly and young individuals . we hypothesized that the relation between the joint moments and vertical ground reaction force differs between the elderly and the young similar to our previous study16 and that there is an age related change in the support strategy use for walking . graph representation of the vertical ground reaction forces and the joint moment of the hip knee and ankle during a gait

the vertical ground reaction force were not significantly different between the elderly and the young . in our previous study16 the knee extension moment during late stance was associated with the anterior component of the ground reaction force of young males and the knee joint moment was associated with the antero posterior component of the ground reaction force of young females . in the elderly females of this study the extension moment of the hip had a positive relationship with the first peak of the ground reaction force . in our previous study16 the extension moment of the hip was associated with the posterior component of ground reaction force in elderly females and the present result is consistent with the result of that previous study . although the knee joint moment was associated with the first peak of the vertical ground reaction force in the young females the hip joint moment was associated with the first peak of the vertical ground reaction force in the elderly females . the elderly and young females in this study made use of different joints to control of the vertical ground reaction force . the extension moment during the early stance phase of the knee had a negative relationship with the minimum value of the ground reaction force at mid stance in the elderly females . moreover the plantarflexion moment of the ankle had a positive relationship with the second peak of the ground reaction force of the elderly females . it is probables that because the elderly females had a lower plantarflexion moment of the ankle than that of young females the second peak of the vertical ground reaction force was smaller in the elderly females in this study . therefore there are gender differences in the age related changes of walking characteristics and elderly males make use of various joint moment patterns to the control of the vertical ground reaction force . the relationship between the vertical ground reaction force and lower extremity joint moments during walking in both elderly and young subjects were investigated .", " a huge body of sequence data annotations and knowledge is available in the literature online resources and biological databases such as genbank uniprot protein data bank epiflu database openflu database influenza research database ird and the immune epitope database iedb . for example when a new infectious influenza strain emerges such as h9n7 avian flu or a new seasonal flu it is desirable to rapidly investigate its similarities and dissimilarities with known sequences its epidemic or pandemic potential in humans how different it is from the past vaccine strains and its t and b cell epitopes from previously circulating strains and estimate its immune escape potential . additionally for new pandemic strains such as 2009 swine flu it is desirable to establish origin and identify strains that are useful vaccine candidates . flukb is a knowledge based system that integrates multiple types of influenza data and analytical tools into such workflows to support vaccine target discovery . the datasets in flukb consist of curated enriched and standardized protein sequence data immunological data from multiple data sources and a set of modular analysis tools . the analysis tools infrastructure comprises a library of individual tools along with standard applicable to multiple pathogens and specific influenza vaccine target discovery workflows . the data repository within flukb contains four types of data protein sequence data hla related data t cell epitopes and hla ligands 3d crystal structures and neutralizing antibody related data . protein sequences available from influenza a b and c viruses were collected from ird and genbank while hla related data were collected from iedb . the metadata included a vocabulary that comprises the instances of the following terms protein names host names geographic locations years and subtypes . to verify the protein annotations of newly added entries protein assignment of the strain proteomes was done by aligning the entry proteome sequence to a representative influenza reference sequences using the blast algorithm . we selected 10 proteins from uniprot that have detailed annotations as reference sequences for each protein of the two influenza types a and b . flukb includes entries from iedb that bind hla class i or ii allele with at least one positive result or those reported as t cell epitopes . for each neutralizing antibody the following descriptive information is provided in the flukb isolation information from human samples or from antibody phage display libraries from the primary literature the corresponding crystal structure of antibody ha complex from the pdb database the b cell epitope sequence variants detected from experimentally validated strains and computationally defined b cell epitopes on ha protein displayed as both sequence and 3d structure with jmol . each influenza strain sample is annotated using the nomenclature originally proposed by the who providing a shorthand description of influenza virus strains . for example the nomenclature of an influenza isolate of type a subtype h2n3 isolated from a duck in heinersdorf in 1986 is written using the original nomenclature as a peking duck heinersdorf648 41986h2n3 a peking duck heinersdorf648 41986h2n3 the lack of standardization of nomenclature has led to inconsistent nomenclature and incomplete metadata thus increasing the difficulty in extraction of specific data subsets for analysis . to ensure a complete access control over the sequence data within flukb each entry the key is represented in flukb as a standardized fasta header that provides a condensed and detailed summary of the sample s information . the flukb data mining key for the heinersdorf sample ha protein is flu0175850type ahostmallardanas platyrhynchos8839location heinersdorfberlin germanyde beisolate648 4year1986subtype h2n3protein haseqtype

detailed sequence annotations into the fasta format enabling easy combination of the results of sequence comparison with the analysis of annotations . the flukb sequence repository as of december 2014 contains 402306 sequence entries from 75426 unique strains of influenza . each entry contains a protein sequence with standardized curated and enriched annotations table 2 . our effort in the data cleaning and enrichment stage focused on minimizing errors and maximizing data completeness to enhance knowledge extraction for discovery of potential vaccine targets in influenza as well as genetic and epidemiological modeling of viral strains . to enable automated data mining and workflows we created data mining keys from the original nomenclature of influenza viruses with standardized terms . in flukb two search strategies can be deployed for sequence search annotation based or epitope based . besides sequence search the flukb entries can be searched for t cell epitopes and b cell epitopes . tab by entering either a list of sequence ids in the query window or a selection of subsets of proteins by name influenza type subtype range of years of identification country province host or complete sequences fragments . after selection of input parameters for example allele hla a0201 protein ha influenza type a subtype years 2013 2014 affinity threshold 500 nm and conservation threshold 95 and remaining values default 98 sequences will be selected and the report will be generated . flukb offers the capability to address complex questions relating to sequence variability on very specific subsets identification of potential t cell epitopes and selection and combination of these epitopes into polyvalent vaccine constructs . they represent well maintained catalogues of influenza sequences and annotations along with a selection of basic search tools . the flukb was developed focusing on a different purpose the facilitation of data mining for influenza vaccinology and immunology of influenza infection . the flukb has very clean and standardized data integrating information on antigen sequences and immunological epitopes . this includes the discovery of vaccine targets assessment of variability and in depth analysis of immune epitope . flukb is a unique data mining system for largely automated knowledge discovery from the ever increasing body of influenza data with applications in both t cell and b cell immunology and vaccinology . flukb is a contribution to the long standing quest for universal influenza vaccines 41 42 by allowing a large scale analysis on a large collection of annotated influenza sequences .", " we report a case of a 68year old patient with advanced npc who developed intrathoracic endotracheal metastasis after rt . we believe this to be the first reported case of intrathoracic endotracheal metastasis in an npc patient . however 2 months later a metastatic nodule about 1.5 1.1 cm was found in the left lower lobe of the lung . similarly tracheal metastasis from a very distant site has also been poorly documented and the upper trachea is the most frequently involved site . to the best of our knowledge there is no report on intrathoracic endotracheal metastasis with nasopharyngeal origin . distant metastasis after treatment is the main problem in npc patients with advanced disease . it is not certain whether the secondary tracheal tumor is the consequence of the lung metastasis . the presence of endophytic tumor growth and the intact outer layer of the trachea found on ct images suggest that it was most likely a separate metastatic deposit .", " among the various methods available to quantify proteinuria alternative methods like a spot urine sample protein creatinine p c ratio avoid the influence of variations in urinary solute concentrations and can reduce the delay in diagnosis and management of preeclamptic patients . though serum uric acid level is of limited use in the initial diagnosis of preeclampsia many investigators have shown that it correlates well with the disease severity . in this study we have tried to correlate spot urine p c ratio with 24h urine protein estimation and test its diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant proteinuria . we have also correlated spot urine p c ratio with serum uric acid levels and tried to analyze the association between proteinuria and

containing exceptionally powerful hepatotoxins . among mushroom intoxications the amatoxin syndrome is of primary importance because it accounts for about 90 of fatalities . being the most common and deadly cause of mushroom poisoning the present paper analyzes the pathogenesis clinical features prognostic indicators and therapeutic strategies of alf secondary to amanita phalloides intoxication . even if phallotoxins are highly toxic to liver cells they add little to the amanita phalloides toxicity as they are not adsorbed from the intestine and do not reach the liver . amatoxins are not significantly protein bound and are cleared from plasma within 48 h of ingestion 16 17 . the clinical picture due to amanita phalloides poisoning can range from a mild subclinical presentation to a lethal fulminant course . as a result not all patients with amanita phalloides poisoning develop alf and have a fatal outcome . the clinical picture of amanita phalloides intoxication as the toxins are not irritating by themselves the initial phase is characterized by the absence of any signs or symptoms . it is important for an early diagnosis to suspect amatoxin intoxication in any case of a relatively prolonged latency period between mushroom ingestion and onset of symptoms since other toxic mushrooms that do not cause liver involvement usually induce gastrointestinal symptoms much earlier 1 2 h after ingestion 1 2 4 10 21 . in this third stage despite the apparent improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms the effects of toxins are damaging both the liver and kidneys resulting in a progressive deterioration of liver enzyme tests with an increase of serum transaminases and lactic dehydrogenase . the clinical efficacy of any modality of treatment for amatoxin poisoning is difficult to demonstrate since randomized controlled clinical trials have not been reported . the management of amatoxin poisoning consists of preliminary medical care supportive measures specific therapies and liver transplantation . a complete analysis of the world experience in treatment of amatoxin poisoning was published in 2002 by enjalbert et al . although the real efficacy of this method or that of the other liver support systems should be analyzed in appropriate trials their use may represent a potential additional option to treat patients with severe amanitina poisoning . according to retrospective data most authors indicate that silibinin and n acetylcysteine nac may be effective in the management of patients with amanita phalloides poisoning 1 2 4 21 . nac is used in many centers in patients with alf not induced by paracetamol and its administration has been proposed also in cases of amatoxin poisoning although the data are quite limited . amatoxin poisoning may progress into alf and eventually death if liver transplantation lt is not performed . since the number of patients with amatoxin poisoning evaluated for lt is quite small the most widely used criteria for urgent lt in patients with alf are those of the king s college hospital described by ogrady et al . however some of these criteria can not be easily transferred in patients with amatoxin poisoning . retrospectively analyzed the outcome of a large series of amatoxin intoxication cases and found that predictors of death were the prothrombin index in combination with the serum creatinine level on 310 days after ingestion . thus these authors proposed that a patient with amatoxin poisoning should be listed for urgent lt regardless of the presence of hepatic encephalopathy if the prothrombin index is less than 25 and serum creatinine greater than 106 mol l at the third day after ingestion . interestingly these authors proposed that an interval between the ingestion of toxic mushrooms and the onset of diarrhea shorter than 8 h should prompt an especially careful monitoring because of the high risk of fatal outcome .", " the causative organisms of endogenous endophthalmitis have been found to vary largely between different geographical locations 57 . in most published series which contained both fungal and bacterial endogenous endophthalmitis fungal infections were the most common causes 810 . the aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical features causative organisms infective sources and outcomes of endogenous endophthalmitis in three tertiary eye centers in hong kong over an 8year period . we also aimed to assess whether the type of infection would influence the visual outcome by comparing eyes with bacterial endogenous endophthalmitis versus those with fungal endogenous endophthalmitis . this was a retrospective study of consecutive cases of infective endogenous endophthalmitis in three hospitals including hong kong eye hospital queen elizabeth hospital and prince of wales hospital in hong kong . inclusion criteria included diagnosis of infective endogenous endophthalmitis proven by blood culture from 2000 to 2007 . we hypothesized that eyes with fungal endogenous endophthalmitis will have a better visual prognosis with 90 of eyes having vision of fc or better compared with 50 of eyes for bacterial endogenous endophthalmitis . with an alpha of 5 our sample size of 16 eyes with bacterial endogenous endophthalmitis and 6 eyes with fungal infection will have a 54 power to detect a significant difference between the two groups a total of 22 eyes of 21 patients one patient with bilateral involvement was identified to have endogenous endophthalmitis during the study period table 1 . preexisting medical conditions that predisposed the development of endogenous endophthalmitis included diabetes mellitus 11 eyes 50 urinary tract infection 8 eyes 36.4 septicemia 7 eyes 31.8 recent general surgery 5 eyes 22.7 liver abscess 4 eyes 18.2 and malignancy 4 eyes 18.2 . eyes that had endogenous endophthalmitis due to fungal infection were more likely to have vision of fc or better compared with eyes that had endogenous endophthalmitis due to bacterial infection 83.3 versus 25 resp . following the onset of endogenous endophthalmitis all patients had diagnostic tapping for ocular specimen for microbiological investigations including vitreous tap in 15 68.2 eyes and aqueous tap in 10 45.5 eyes . there was a suggestive trend of having more enucleation or evisceration in eyes that had bacterial endogenous endophthalmitis 6 eyes 37.5 compared with fungal endogenous endophthalmitis 0 eye 0 but the difference failed to reach the level of statistical significance chi square test p 0.07 . diagnosis of endogenous endophthalmitis is mainly based on clinical findings and empirical treatment is usually administered while waiting for the microbiological investigations results from blood or intraocular specimens . endogenous endophthalmitis is commonly associated with systemic conditions that can cause a relative immunocompromised state . in a major review of 267 cases of bacterial endogenous endophthalmitis by jackson et al . this relatively low positive rate revealed the difficulty of making a microbiological diagnosis in endogenous endophthalmitis . most of the published series that have included both fungal and bacterial endogenous endophthalmitis showed that fungal endogenous endophthalmitis was more common compared with bacterial cause 811 . treatment modality for bacterial endogenous endophthalmitis employed in our series included intravitreal and systemic antibiotics and antifungal as well as surgical treatments like ppv . despite treatment although previous studies suggested that fungal endogenous endophthalmitis was associated with better vision compared with bacterial endogenous endophthalmitis 810 our findings showed no significant difference in the proportion of eyes with fc or better vision at the latest follow up . in conclusion in contrast with previous studies our series showed that bacterial causes in particular gram negative bacteria were more common than fungal causes of endogenous endophthalmitis .", " we report the case of a 46year old woman presented with perforation of her ligamentum flavum lf by sequestrated posterior epidural lumbar intervertebral disc . to

degree avb 19 in medical and 27 in interventional treatment without statistically significant difference . in this regards we evaluated the association of avb and cad to elucidate whether avb is reversible in patients with cad . irreversible avb was observed in 173 patients ib group who had undergone implantation of a permanent pacemaker . on the aspect of cad type and reversibility of avb 1315 86.7 patients had ami 02 0 had unstable angina and 141 2.4 with stable angina had reversible avb fig . the proportion of reversible avb in patients with ami was significantly higher than other groups patients without cad with stable angina and with unstable angina . avb was rarely reversible in the non ami group as only one of 43 patients 2.3 showed reversible avb . in contrast 13 of 15 patients with ami 86.7 had reversible avb and there were significant difference between non ami group and ami group p0.001 . the proportion of reversible avb among patients with rca lesion was also significantly higher in ami group p0.001 . on the aspect of cad type and reversibility of avb 1315 86.7 patients had ami 02 0 had unstable angina and 141 2.4 with stable angina had reversible avb fig . the proportion of reversible avb in patients with ami was significantly higher than other groups patients without cad with stable angina and with unstable angina . avb was rarely reversible in the non ami group as only one of 43 patients 2.3 showed reversible avb . in contrast 13 of 15 patients with ami 86.7 had reversible avb and there were significant difference between non ami group and ami group p0.001 . the proportion of reversible avb among patients with rca lesion was also significantly higher in ami group p0.001 . the main finding of this study is that avb in patients with ami is usually reversible while avb in patients with cad other than ami is usually irreversible . the causal relationship between avb and inferior wall ami avb complicates inferior wall ami in 10 to 15 of cases7 9 and most of these patients can be recovered from avb by revascularization.10 12 however the association of cad other than ami and reversibility of avb is still unclear and is rarely studied . in this context we tried to evaluate the association of avb and cad in order to elucidate whether avb is reversible in patients with cad . patients with new onset avb might present with ami unstable angina or stable angina . if a patient with avb presents with unstable angina we recommend that the patient undergo pacemaker implantation first and then revascularization therapy . if patients of new onset avb have no evidence of ami or unstable angina then pacemaker implantation would be the most important treatment because the reversibility of avb in these patients is hardly expected . the location of pathologic coronary artery among patients with irreversible avb showed similar distribution compare to the results of previous several studies table 5.2 614 in the present study type iv was the most common type of coronary pathology and type ii was the second most common type in ib group type i anatomy observed in 9.1 of patients with cad type ii in 22.7 type iii in 15.9 and type iv in 52.3 . by screening all patients with new onset avb who visited our hospital majority of patients had no evidence of cad while only 2 patients presented with unstable angina . our results show that avb in patients with ami is usually reversible after revascularization treatment while patients with avb without ami usually required implantation of a permanent pacemaker irrespective of the presence of cad . avb in patients with cad other than ami is usually irreversible therefore implantation of a pacemaker should be considered on a preferential basis . our results show that avb in patients with ami is usually reversible after revascularization treatment while patients with avb without ami usually required implantation of a permanent pacemaker irrespective of the presence of cad . avb in

protein mg dl in study and control groups serum leptin levels were significantly higher in the study group 1.44 0.72 ng ml compared to that in the control group 0.68 0.55 ng ml . similar observation holds true when we analyze the serum leptin levels in male and female patients separately . serum leptin levels were significantly higher in the study group 1.44 0.72 ng ml compared to that in the control group 0.68 0.55 ng ml . similar observation holds true when we analyze the serum leptin levels in male and female patients separately . on further analyzing the correlation of serum leptin and crp with bmi in the study group figure 1 we observed the following correlation of serum leptin and c reactive protein with body mass index serum leptin and bmi have a statistically significant positive correlation r 0.314 with a p value of 0.048.crp and bmi did not show any significant correlation r 0.126 with a p value of 0.438 . serum leptin and bmi have a statistically significant positive correlation r 0.314 with a p value of 0.048 . the above results indicate that serum leptin might be a better biomarker than crp for predicting nutritional status in esrd patients on maintenance hemodialysis . this study was an effort to find the association of body weight with serum leptin levels and crp in patients with chronic renal failure on hemodialysis . reasonably good subjects of either gender spread over a wide age range 20 70 years thus justifying a better exploration of the correlation between serum leptin and bmi in esrd patients on hemodialysis in indian population . serum leptin levels in this study were significantly higher in patients with ckd on maintenance hemodialysis than that in controls p 0.001 . many studies are available in the literature to correlate the relationship between serum leptin levels and bmi in patients with esrd on hemodialysis with controversial results . the present study further reinforces the direct correlation of serum leptin with bmi in ckd patients on hemodialysis which is in accordance with the theory of reverse epidemiology . on hemodialysis patients suggested a paradoxically inverse association between higher serum leptin levels and markers of nutritional status a finding that was consistent with the theory of reverse epidemiology given by kalantar et al . this study demonstrates the superiority of serum leptin vis vis crp as a biomarker to assess nutritional status in patients with esrd on hemodialysis .", " but it is the lever model coupled with the bending beam analogy of the mandible that form the foundation of the generally accepted longitudinal stress distribution pattern depicted in figure 1a 1821 and its variant figure 1b 18 20 22 23 . the lever is an oversimplified structural representation of the jaw so biomechanical concepts derived from it should be suspect . more specifically the central issues involve 1 the relationship between occlusal force direction and the associated stress distributions within an intact mandible and 2 the extrapolation of those stress fields to a plated fractured mandible . figure 2a is a partial because dimensions irrelevant to this discussion are omitted free body diagram fbd of the frame versus lever figure 1 idealized mandible . and symbolize the net internal loads at the interface real or imaginary that are necessary to maintain the static equilibrium of the anterior segment when occlusal force t acts on it . the analysis is based on the range of occlusal force directions represented in figure 3a . it is emphasized that 1 and figures 24 essentially and apply identically to the imaginary anterior segment of an intact mandible and to an actual fractured off section but that is where the similarity ends . similarly uniform tensile stress t is the equivalent to the posteriorly directed in figure 5e . for completeness the shear stress equivalent of is included in figure 5 but as generally done in the literature it is henceforth ignored . however the system that is equivalent to a specific set of and figure 4 is provided by the loads hu vu mu hl vl ml and identified in the fbd of the plated fractured segment in figure 6b not the distributed bone stresses at the imaginary section figures 1 and 5 . and are representative of the normal perpendicular and shear contact forces respectively on the fractured bone surface if the two segments touch . for the equilibrium of the intact or fractured mandible these moments and t s horizontal and vertical components must be opposed by the internal loads and respectively figures 2b and 4 and 1 . in the intact mandible and are expressed as equivalent stress distributions figure 5 . for convenience andor perhaps because of the lever model legacy studies have generally been limited to occlusal forces in one usually vertical t3 direction . in either case there is no compelling justification for the vertical occlusal force simplification and as demonstrated occlusal force direction is a critical determinant of the mechanical environment and within a mandible . the stress distribution within the body of the mandible there is a decreasing tension gradient from the gingival height and near the mid level there is a reversal to an increasing gradient of compression toward the inferior border . this tension on top compression on bottom tot cob stress distribution is consistent with the inherent vertical occlusal force of the lever . and as demonstrated its presence has the potential to profoundly alter the stress distribution within the mandible from the generally accepted tot cob figures 1 5d and 7d to as an example exactly the opposite figure 7b left . if t acts through the circle t0 then the longitudinal stress in the body of the mandible is entirely a uniform compression figures 5a and 7a . in the bottom part of the mandible 1 is associated with compression c but 1 is associated with tension t . thus depending on the relative magnitudes of c and t the net longitudinal stress in the bottom part of the mandible can be tensile zero or compressive left middle and right respectively in figure 7b . t 2 figures 4c and 5c like t1 produces a uniform compression consistent with 2 but because 2 is ccw its associated gradient is t c. so when these 2 longitudinal stress distributions are superimposed figure 7c it is certain that the bottom part of the mandible is in compression but depending on the position of t2 s loa within the shaded region in figure 5c the top part can be in tension stress free or in compression . t 3 the lever replica figures 4d and 5d is vertical so there is no 3 equivalent stress . combined with the ccw 4 s t c gradient the top portion of the mandible will be in tension but the bottom portion can be in tension stress free or in compression figure 7e . thus of the 11 possibilities depicted in figure 7 only 3 left in figure 7c figure 7d and right in figure 7e are in concert with the lever s tot cob longitudinal stress distribution . when the concepts and terminology from the intact mandible are applied to this outcome it is ascribed to compression on top and tension on the bottom 26 37 . in conclusion 1 the lever based tension on top compression on bottom tot cob stress gradient should not be assumed in the intact mandible . it is only one of several possible stress distributions that depend on the direction of the occlusal force and the relative location of the section in question . 3 the stress distribution within an intact mandible should not be extrapolated to a plated or otherwise stabilized mandible .", " the saccade neural network requires involvement of a series of neurons designed to imitate the behavior of actual neuronal populations in the horizontal saccade controller . to encompass all of the desired neural behaviors for the other neurons several modifications to the generic neuron model seem necessary that directly impact its firing rate trajectory 13 . the extracellular recordings including spike trains and lfps were taken from the saccadic burst neurons sbns in the paramedian pontine reticular formation pprf at the premotor level the omnipause neurons in the nucleus raphe interpositus and the motoneurons at the motor level . to encompass all of the desired neural behaviors neural circuitry is used to match the firing rate trajectory of the premotor neurons . we model the saccade induced spiking activities at the premotor level with an hh model for the bursting neurons and with a modified fitzhugh nagumo fhn model for the tonic spiking neurons . it is important that this new more complex time optimal controller ascertains that the firing rate of the motoneurons does not change as a function of saccade magnitude during the pulse innervation of the oculomotor plant . it is indicated that the muscle fiber model substantiates the fact that the number of motoneurons firing has the highest influence on the accuracy of saccade controller contradicting the control strategy of adjusting the firing rates among the whole neurons . investigation of muscle fiber model is imperative because it allows for recognizing the effects of the firing of individual neurons as well as the number of active neurons firing maximally in controlling the saccades . this investigation as well provides an optimum fit for the agonist and antagonist neural controllers to match the experimental data for the small saccades . in this paper we focus on neural control of horizontal monkey saccades . a neural network model of saccade related neural sites in the midbrain is first presented . in consequence to match the dynamics of the neurons and the synapses saccadic circuitry including omnipause neuron opn premotor excitatory burst neuron ebn inhibitory burst neuron ibn long lead burst neuron llbn tonic neuron tn interneuron in and motoneurons of abducens nucleus an and oculomotor nucleus on finally the motoneuronal control signals drive a time optimal controller that stimulates a mfm model of the oculomotor plant . we abbreviate the conjugate goal directed horizontal monkey saccade with the term saccade throughout the paper . each neuron in the parallel distributed network fires in response to other neurons to stimulate the final motoneurons on both sides of the network in a determined manner to execute a saccade . in the context of the neuroanatomical connectivity structure in figure 1 the saccade neural network includes neuron populations to imitate the behavior of actual neuronal populations in the initiation control and termination of the saccadic burst generator . a description of the synaptic properties of the major neural sites involved in execution of a saccade provides the basis for developing quantitative computational models of the neural network . the saccade generator investigated in this work is built upon the extant research 13 13 14 16 17 . the differentiation between these two modes has been governed by the fact that when the saccade size increases more active neurons are firing synchronously to form the agonist neural input for small saccades . for large saccades however the number of active neurons firing maximally remains unchanged consistent with the time optimal controller described by enderle and wolfe . we next demonstrate features of the structure of the proposed saccade neural network to highlight the important neurological control implications . such coding manifests activities including the onset of burst firing before saccade peak firing rate and end of firing with respect to the saccade termination for each neuron on the basis of the physiological evidence . table 1 summarizes the activities in initiating controlling and terminating the burst firing through the neural network generating a saccade in the right eye . the firing rate trajectories of a medium lead burst neuron of monkey data for saccades of 4 8 12 16 and 20 are provided . the entire active agonist neurons fire maximally during the pulse interval of the saccade . for small saccades the controller is constrained by a required minimum duration of the agonist pulse . knowing this the saccade magnitude depends on the number of active neurons firing maximally in accord with the physiological evidence 3 12 . note that the number of active neurons is the only parameter that varies in the mfm among different saccades in an adaptive control strategy of the oculomotor plant . it is demonstrated 3 12 that adjusting this parameter provides significant analytical convenience in controlling the small saccades as opposed to changing the firing rate of all active neurons as a function of saccade magnitude . as motoneurons receive excitatory input from the ipsilateral ebn the burst discharge in them during a saccade is adequately similar to the ebn bursting . such burst discharge in the motoneurons is responsible for the movement of the rectus muscles during a saccade . the firing rate trajectory of the ebn is of prime importance in control of such a saccade . it is implied that the number of cells firing in the llbn is determined by the number of cells firing in the sc as long as there is a feedback error maintained by the cerebellar vermis . the neural activity within each block is represented as pulses andor steps consistent with the described burst discharge mechanism to reflect the neural operation as timing gates . it represents the sequence of events accounted for by enderle and zhou with modifications made in steps ivvii to indicate the function of local neural integrators tn and in in providing the step component to the motoneurons.the deep layers of the sc initiate a saccade based on the distance between the current position of the eye and the desired target.the ipsilateral llbn and ebn are stimulated by the contralateral sc burst cells . the following includes our modeling of the premotor and motor neurons at the circuit level . we introduce a neural circuit model that can be parameterized to match the described firing characteristics of each type of neuron . a generic neuron circuit model is introduced in this section together with the description of the modifications required to populate a neural network for control of saccades . the saccade circuitry underlies the dynamics of the above eight distinct neurons each of which contributes to the control mechanism of the saccade . each neuron s dendrite rise time constant determines the delay to emulate the postsynaptic potential propagation along the dendrite consistent with the initiation of firing with respect to the saccade onset provided in table 1 . this adjustment is intended for each neuron to contribute to the generation of the saccade by mimicking the required physiological properties . this table summarizes all the differences dendritic axonal and synaptic among eight distinct neurons whose realization is important in the time optimal control of the saccade . these models describe how the neural innervation signals from motoneurons are converted to the active state tensions to drive the agonist and antagonist muscle during the saccade assuming that there is an oculomotor plant with a given order . the saccade induced spiking activities at the premotor level are modeled with an hh model for the bursting neurons . the onset delay before saccade peak firing rate and burst termination time for the different neuron populations we arranged 100 identical muscle fibers n 1 and m 100 since this coordination provided sufficient resolution in matching the experimental data . as described the number of active neurons impacts the control of saccades instead of the variations in the firing rate of those neurons under the time optimal control strategy . in addition the number of active neurons differs from saccade to saccade as evident by the dynamics observed in the main sequence diagrams 3 12 . each active neuron exhibits the pause slide step firing trajectory as later shown in figure 11 substantiating the physiological accuracy of the agonist controller model . the number of active neurons is estimated to be 75 neurons for the 12 saccade 100 neurons for the 16 saccade and 92 neurons for the 20 saccade . table 3 lists the number of active neurons and the duration of the burst agonist pulse for the five different saccades in this work . for sample illustrations the plots of dendritic membrane potential first column axonal membrane potential second column and synaptic current pulse train third column of the ipsilateral burst neurons and in in generation of the 16 saccade recall that the train of action potentials is converted to a train of the current pulses in the presynaptic terminal of the neuron to provide excitatory or inhibitory input to the succeeding neurons based on the neural connections in figure 1 . furthermore the burst onset and offset for each premotor neuron in figure 10 agreed with its place within saccadic circuitry s hierarchical processing order in generating the final motoneuronal signals . presented in figure 11 are the ipsilateral agonist first and third rows and antagonist second and last rows burst tonic firing rates with their respective active state tensions for the saccades . the parameterized saccadic oculomotor plant for the trend of changes in muscle tensions involved in each saccade is such that neuron data derived active state tensions drive the muscle fiber oculomotor plant . the trajectory of variation in the agonist pulse magnitude among these saccades is consistent with the agonist pulse magnitude saccade magnitude characteristic for the large saccades refer to figure 1.25a in . implementing the opn dendrite and synapse models in order that this neuron stops inhibiting the ebn about 10 ms before the saccade and resumes its inhibition almost when the saccade ends was subject to numerous experimental tunings see table 1 . the computer simulations of neural circuitry herein allow synaptic stimuli to propagate through the saccade pathways so that the motoneurons ultimately drive the oculomotor plant . without such appropriate parameters the set of agonist antagonist control inputs to the muscle fiber oculomotor plant supports the time optimal controller in which the motoneurons firing rate does not determine the saccade magnitude . the application of the mfm in the oculomotor plant proves important in accommodating the constraint on the number of active neurons firing maximally in controlling the saccade magnitude . the number of the active neurons is a key parameter whose adjustment in the mfm is vital in providing the desired saccade control simulation results . it follows from our observations that the duration of the agonist burst firing and the number of active agonist neurons are integral to determining the saccade size see table 3 . it is concluded that the neural network is constrained by a minimum duration of the agonist pulse and that the most dominant factor in determination of the amplitude is the number of active neurons for the small saccades . the number of active neurons for the 16 and 20 saccades remains relatively the same although the 12 saccade aggregates fewer active neurons as seen in table 3 . the dependence of these different saccades on the agonist pulse duration has been found to be well presented by our time optimal controller . under the time optimal strategy the number of neurons that actively fire and the duration of the agonist pulse determined the saccade magnitude .", " smoking cessation with the use of electronic cigarette led to reversal of chronic idiopathic neutrophilia . the daily use of electronic cigarette may help preserve the beneficial effects of smoking cessation . chronic idiopathic neutrophilia cin is a condition characterized by asymptomatic elevation of white blood cells wbcs and neutrophil count that persists for years without any underlying disease.9 smoking has been implicated as a cause of this condition910 and leukocyte count is a predictor of future cardiovascular events.1112 to the best of our knowledge we report for the first time a case study of a subject with cin that was reversed by smoking cessation with the daily use of electronic cigarettes . in february 2012 it should be mentioned that use of electronic cigarettes was a personal choice of the patient no advice or recommendation to use it was provided by the physicians since it has not been approved as a smoking cessation method . to the best of our knowledge this is the first study which reports that smoking cessation with the use of electronic cigarette leads to reversal of chronic idiopathic neutrophilia . the most important message is that despite the daily use of electronic cigarette by this patient the beneficial effects of smoking cessation were maintained . electronic cigarettes were invented in 2003 with awareness and use increasing significantly over the past 3 years.13 they have been introduced to the market as tobacco harm reduction products and they may have a unique role in this field . until recently research on the composition toxicology and clinical effects of electronic cigarettes was scarce . vardavas et al18 found that 5 minute use of electronic cigarette produced a mild but significant elevation in pulmonary resistance.18 however no comparison with the effects of tobacco cigarettes was performed . flouris et al19 found that no elevation in wbc count was found after electronic cigarette use in comparison wbc and neutrophil counts were significantly elevated immediately after tobacco cigarette smoking.19 farsalinos et al20 studied smokers and electronic cigarette users with echocardiography before and after smoking and electronic cigarette use respectively.20 acute diastolic dysfunction was observed in smokers immediately after smoking 1 cigarette while diastolic function was preserved after using the electronic cigarette for 7 minutes . in any case regulation and specific quality standards should be implemented as the use of non pharmaceutical grade nicotine or other constituents may lead to the presence of toxic tobacco impurities in the liquids which will be subsequently inhaled by the user.14 although we can not exclude that some constituents of electronic cigarette vapor may have had beneficial effects in reducing wbc count in our patient the most probable explanation is that reversal of cin was caused by smoking cessation itself . electronic cigarette use was successful as a smoking cessation tool after two failures to quit smoking one with the use of currently approved pharmaceutical methods . the daily use of electronic cigarettes did not hinder the beneficial effects of smoking cessation in this patient . undoubtedly this case report is in no way conclusive about the effects of electronic cigarettes on health . should they advise patients who have managed to quit smoking by using electronic cigarettes like our patient to stop using them with the risk of smoking relapse and should patients who have repeatedly failed to quit smoking by currently approved methods such as the patient in this study be denied the possibility however small it may be to quit smoking by using electronic cigarettes", " based on the results of 5 randomized clinical trials rcts mechanical thrombectomy using the stent retriever has been approved as standard treatment for acute anterior circulation stroke due to occlusions of the internal carotid artery ica or the m1 segment of the middle cerebral artery mca . recent studies regarding meta analysis of the 5 rcts showed that stent retriever thrombectomy is associated with considerable improvement of functional independence compared with standard medical care . after its acceptance as an effective treatment option the next steps will be to further establish patient selection criteria and to generalize stent retriever thrombectomy to a broader class of stroke patients with acute large vessel occlusions . to further broaden treatment indications for stent retriever thrombectomy although there exist a few studies that have investigated prognostic factors that predict outcomes after stent retriever thrombectomy in patients with acute anterior circulation stroke these studies are limited by small sample size and the inclusion of patients with posterior circulation stroke 4 8 . thus this study aimed to investigate clinical imaging and procedural factors predictive of good outcome and mortality after stent retriever thrombectomy in a large cohort of patients with acute anterior circulation stroke from december 2010 to november 2015 a total of 356 consecutive patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke due to ica or mca occlusions were treated with stent retriever thrombectomy at a comprehensive regional stroke center . of 356 patients those who had a prestroke modified rankin scale mrs score 3 n11 or concomitant posterior circulation infarctions n8 or who were lost to follow up n2 we prospectively collected the following clinical imaging and procedural data of these 335 patients demographic features cerebrovascular risk factors nihss scores on admission use of iv thrombolysis time to endovascular treatment procedure time time to reperfusion

parenchymal hemorrhage or 2.961 95 ci 1.059 8.276 p0.038 were independent predictors of mortality at 3 months table 3 . the main findings of our study are summarized as follows 1 age revascularization status and parenchymal hemorrhage are significant independent predictors of not only good clinical outcome but also mortality at 3 months 2 in addition nihss score on admission is independently associated with good outcome whereas a history of previous stroke tia is independently associated with mortality . several studies have evaluated independent predictors of clinical outcome after stent retriever thrombectomy in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to intracranial large vessel occlusion 4 8 . symptomatic ich baseline dwi aspect score baseline nihss 20 and onset to recanalization 5 hours have been identified as independent predictors of mortality after stent retriever thrombectomy . the strengths of our study include a large sample size inclusion of only anterior circulation stroke and consistency in patient selection and endovascular procedures . the results of our study are in agreement with those of north american solitaire stent retriever acute stroke nasa registry which included 354 patients . our study suggests that successful recanalization is still a strong predictor of clinical outcome after endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke in this recent era of mechanical thrombectomy . in the nasa registry proximal occlusion ica or basilar artery occlusion high admission nihss score 18 and need for rescue therapy were predictors of mortality in successfully recanalized patients . interestingly a history of previous stroke tia was independently associated with mortality in our study which has not been previously reported in stent retriever thrombectomy studies . although this is a novel finding in studies regarding mechanical thrombectomy using stent retrievers a history of previous stroke tia has been found as a predictor of short term and long term mortality in patients with acute ischemic stroke compared with healthy control subjects in observational studies . in conclusion age revascularization status and parenchymal hemorrhage are independently associated with both good outcome and mortality after stent retriever thrombectomy in patients with acute anterior circulation stroke . our results suggest that achieving successful revascularization and trying to reduce parenchymal hemorrhage are priorities when performing stent retriever thrombectomy in patients with acute anterior circulation stroke . the data also suggest a novel finding that a history of previous stroke tia can be considered a predictor of mortality in patients receiving stent retriever thrombectomy .", " nonspecific ileitis crohn s disease intestinal tuberculosis or ischemic enteritis were suggested as possible causes of the bowel wall thickening and in order to evaluate the terminal ileum colonoscopic examination was performed . in addition the terminal ileum was dilated and showed diffuse concentric wall thickening of its long segments with heterogeneous contrast enhancement . in the thickened wall there appeared to be several possible diagnoses including ischemic enterocolitis caused by thromboembolism of mesenteric vessels arising from atrial fibrillation inflammatory bowel disease involving the ascending colon and terminal ileum and ischemic or infectious enteritis associated with colon cancer . at this time the hepatic flexure of the ascending colon was found to be completely obstructed by a hard concentric mass and about 15 cm of the terminal ileum just proximal to the ileocecal valve was markedly dilated and diffusely thickened . a cut section of the thickened terminal ileum revealed marked submucosal edema to a depth of approximately 10 mm though there was no evidence of mucosal lesion . microscopic examination also showed that the mucosal folds of thickened ileal loop were blunted by submucosal edema and there was extensive inflammatory reaction with infiltrations of neutrophils . 6 reported the ct findings in one case in which only nonspecific small bowel wall thickening with a small amount of ascites was noted .", " in patients with neuroblastoma we report a case where proteinuria was the initial reason for medical evaluation in a child with neuroblastoma . she had polyuria and hypostenuria diuresis 125 ml kg24 h urinalysis revealed nephrotic range proteinuria 6100 mg24 h with albuminuria 4540 mg24 h urinary loss of igg 107 mg24 h and a1 microglobulin 29.4 mg24 h mild glucosuria 39 mg dl and aminoaciduria were also found without hematuria or casts urinary ph was 7.5 and urinary density 1005 . the upper half of the right kidney showed an area of reduced perfusion while the left kidney showed abnormal tissue density . in this patient the presenting signs and symptoms of neuroblastoma included severe dehydration polyglobulia tubulointerstitial damage with acute kidney injury and renal insufficiency electrolyte and acid base unbalancing and heavy glomerular proteinuria . although diarrhea and dehydration may be observed at presentation of neuroblastoma tubular alterations are definitely unusual . we have been able to identify only one case previously a 4year old boy affected by neuroblastoma presenting with nephrotic syndrome has been described in 1979 and renal histology demonstrated membranous glomerulonephritis due to immune complex . increased vasoactive amine secretion from neuroblastoma is not infrequent and may cause elevated although usually not severe hypertension . in conclusion in our 10month old child alteration of the renal function at both the glomerular and tubular levels were the presenting features of neuroblastoma resulting from multiple pathogenic mechanisms .", " in recent years nevertheless the correlation and function of mirnas and their target genes in pathogenesis of pituitary adenomas remain largely unknown . only a small number of mirnas with their target genes in pituitary adenomas have been validated so far . in this review we summarize recent advances in the study of mirnas and their validated or potential targets in pituitary adenomas and discuss the future perspectives . mir15a and mir16 1 are the first two mirnas shown to have differential expression in pituitary adenomas . mir15a and mir16 1 genes are located at chromosome 13q14 a region which is frequently deleted in pituitary tumors . in 2005 mir15a and mir16 1 were reported to have lower expression in both gh secreting and prl secreting pituitary adenomas than in normal tissues and their downregulation was correlated with greater tumor volume and impaired secretion of p43 a potent anticancer cytokine suggesting that mir15a and mir16 1 may function as tumor suppressors and their inactivation may contribute to tumor growth in pituitary adenomas . this is in accordance with the result of a subsequent report which showed no correlation between downregulation of mir15a and gh secreting pituitary tumor size . in 2007 the most representative ones were mir212 mir026a mir150 mir152 mir191 and mir192 which were upregulated in pituitary adenomas while mir024 1 and mir098 were downregulated in tumor samples . twenty nine mirnas were identified to be able to predict pituitary adenoma histotype acth gh prl secreting adenomas and nfa . investigated the differential expression of some mirnas in acth secreting pituitary tumors . studies were conducted with the aim of investigating the aberrant expression of mirnas in gh secreting pituitary adenomas . identified totally fifty two mirnas to be differentially expressed in gh secreting pituitary adenomas . in 2012 another set of mirnas were identified to be differentially expressed in gh secreting pituitary adenomas . besides mir107 was found to be overexpressed in gh secreting and nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas and inhibited the expression of pituitary tumor suppressor gene aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein aip . identified 17 mirnas which were differentially expressed in gh secreting pituitary tumors . mirnas are also dysregulated in nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas nfa . in another study mir124a was the most upregulated mirna and mir31 was the most downregulated mirna in nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas . some reports suggested that the deregulated mirnas might also regulate cell cycle of pituitary adenomas at the post transcriptional level figure 1 . mir128a is a brain enriched mirna and was reported to be decreased in pituitary adenomas . these mirnas may take part in the regulation of cell cycle in pituitary adenomas together with other related mirnas . regarding the deregulation in pituitary adenomas mir15a and mir16 1 may exert their roles as tumor suppressors by regulating cell cycle . moreover mir26a was also overexpressed in acth secreting pituitary adenomas and plays an important role in cell cycle control by modulating protein kinase c delta . therefore it is possible that in pituitary adenomas mir15a and mir16 1 influence apoptosis by targeting multiple antiapoptotic genes . mir184 was markedly upregulated in gh secreting pituitary adenomas and was correlated with tumor diameter . these data together lead to the hypothesis that many mirnas may function in a network to regulate apoptosis in pituitary adenomas . more mirnas were deregulated between pituitary adenomas and normal pituitaries compared to carcinomas and normal pituitaries . interestingly the inhibition of mir26b and overexpression of mir128 had a synergistic effect on suppressing the tumorigenicity and invasiveness of pituitary tumors . although metastatic pituitary carcinomas are rare these data suggest that altered expression of mirnas may provide diagnostic information to distinguish pituitary adenomas and carcinomas before they metastasize . in 2007 a microarray was carried out to analyze the mirna profiles in pituitary adenomas and normal pituitary samples . in 2010 another study aimed to identify altered expression of mirnas in gh secreting pituitary adenomas . accumulating evidence demonstrates that a large number of mirnas have altered expression in pituitary adenomas and these mirnas may play important roles in tumor progression by targeting multiple genes . the molecular mechanism of the regulation of mirnas in pituitary adenomas is still a mystery . some mirnas have been demonstrated to target multiple genes indicating that they may have different roles in pituitary tumors . therefore the mirnas and their targets could regulate pituitary adenomas progression in a complex network . advances in the technology to investigate mirnas make it easier and faster to explore more exactly the roles of mirnas in pituitary adenomas . continuing study on mirnas and their targets will shed more light on mechanisms of pituitary adenomas .", " altmetrics creates a new approach to evaluating the impact of publications by considering the number of downloads shares and discussions on social networks.1 this approach does not replace the traditional bibliometric indicators such as impact factor and h index but rather focuses on new aspects of publication impact.2 although still in its infancy altmetrics has the potential to become a valid assessment strategy for the evaluation of publication impact.3 altmetric tools capture information through the use of metrics from html views and downloads of articles blog posts tweets bookmarks etc . altmetrics elucidate not only the impact of scientific research by researchers but also the impact of the research on the public through social media.25 in fact through altmetrics the impact of research can be measured at the individual article level using a combination of such data as the number of times that a particular paper has been downloaded discussed shared and cited.6 this approach allows not only researchers but also institutions to analyze postpublication activity around a paper in near real time using various online resources.5 to use this new tool we focused on the italian researchers of the simpar group which was founded in pavia in 2007 . these metrics were classified along two dimensions audience scholars or the public and type of engagement with the online research products viewed discussed saved cited.7 from impact story we were able to retrieve all altmetrics data for the 12 researcher accounts paper citations discussions views by the research community or public . through the personal profiles of altmetrics for each member of the simpar group we were able to count the number of citations times a paper was saved and discussions from the public community for each paper published . then we compared the simpar group percentages of articles cited or highly cited saved or highly saved or discussed relative to those published by single authors either written alone or in collaboration with coauthors who were not members of the simpar group by means of fisher s exact test . quantitative variables are described as median and interquartile range iqr ie the 25th and 75th percentiles and compared to collective simpar data or individual publication articles by means of a nonparametric mann the association between citations from scopus and the altmetric score or its components eg facebook posts tweets mendeley readers was expressed through a nonparametric spearman s correlation coefficient . through the personal profiles of altmetrics for each member of the simpar group we were able to count the number of citations times a paper was saved and discussions from the public community for each paper published . then we compared the simpar group percentages of

expressed through a nonparametric spearman s correlation coefficient . altmetrics demonstrated that simpar group publications were more likely to be saved 78 vs 53 p0.05 and publicly discussed 61 vs 4 p0.0001 than individual publications . moreover 15 articles from the simpar group collectively were accessed through mendeley readers median times accessed 4 iqr 111 versus 85 of the individual publications median times accessed 2 iqr 08 p0.01 . we describe the correlation between scopus citations and the single components of the analyzed alternative metrics in table 1 . we found significant correlations between the simpar group collective publications and their impact on the indicator linked to research activity mendeley readers although not to public discussion such as facebook and tweets . this is meaningful as funders universities and publishers increasingly demand indicators of the impact of science on society.8 moreover we are confident that the new metrics of medical groups could have an impact on the pain patient community as well .", " diverse vasculopathies and thrombophilia of any size and in any vessel encompass vascular accidents of arterial venous vasculitis and thrombosis in behcet s disease . we describe a case of behet s disease that was complicated by cardiac tamponade with hemorrhagic pericarditis ttp dvt coronary artery stenosis and a coronary artery pseudo aneurysm the latter of which occurred during disease evolution . considering the clinical symptoms in total the diagnosis of behcet s disease complicated by ttp and hemorrhagic pericarditis was made . the prevalence of vascular involvement in behet s disease has been reported to range from 7.7 to 60.6 . although the pathogenesis of thrombotic events in behet s disease has not been elucidated microscopic examinations of veins and arteries involved have demonstrated vasculitis . cardiac involvement in behet s disease is rare but pericarditis myocardial infarction coronary arteritis valvular regurgitation especially aortic valve regurgitation and an impaired conduction abnormalities have been reported8 . reported on the possibility of a link between behet s disease and ttp and came to the conclusion that ttp had developed due to some other cause e.g. the prevalence of arterial occlusion in behet s disease has been reported to range from 0.5 to 1.5 and can involve the coronary subclavian carotid renal pulmonary or any peripheral artery and cause myocardial infarction pulseless disease stroke hypertension respiratory failure or intermittent claudication6 . it is significant that aneurysmal rupture is the leading cause of death in behcet s disease patients6 and thus it should be deliberate to counter thrombophilia with anticoagulant therapy despite the presence of the thrombotic event . in our case several studies have been undertaken to examine graft stent implantation in behet s disease . here we report on a behcet s disease patient with rare complications related to the cardiovascular system during disease evolution . these problems included hemorrhagic pericarditis ttp dvt coronary artery stenosis and a coronary artery pseudo aneurysm . cardiovascular complications of bechet s disease must be treated with aggressive immunosuppression using a combination of corticosteroid and a cytotoxic agents . in patients with graft stent implantation as evidenced by the present case anticoagulants like coumadin may cause aneurysm formation and growth in behet s disease . therefore for patients with behet s disease the early detection of cardiovascular complications is of cardinal importance as they are the leading cause of mortality . we recommend that physicians pay close attention to even minor complaints and that physical changes be scrutinized and that regular screening protocols are established for the early detection of cardiovascular complications in behet s disease .", " the presence of an adaptive immune system in microorganisms was unanticipated when what is now known as the crispr cas systems were suggested in 2005 and subsequently demonstrated in 2007 . in the case of the acid mine drainage viral community early experiment on the role of crispr cas in virus host interaction in laboratory settings was published in 2013 using the bacterial dairy workhorse streptococcus thermophilus and its d2972 phage . by following the bacteria phage co evolution in the population it was clear that crispr spacer diversification and phage evolution was very quick and it was also discovered that certain regions of the phage genome were preferred as targets for the crispr cas system . another study on the same species demonstrated that in addition to the expected competition between crispr cas immunity and phage escape mutants there were some unanticipated results phages could establish themselves in a culture containing one but not 2 spacers targeting it bacteria without crispr cas immunity persist in cultures despite presence of a large amount of phage and bacteria with 2 spacers targeting a phage could still not establish themselves in a population of phage sensitive bacteria . the authors conclude that for a full understanding of the interaction of phage and their host bacteria a model beyond a simple iterative process of crispr cas immunity and phages escaping it is needed . unlike s. thermophilus p. aeruginosa frequently become resistant to phage not just by using its crispr cas system but also by mutating the receptor that the phage uses for infection . under nutrient rich conditions the authors demonstrated that the flood of infections during nutrient rich conditions makes a constitutive defense favorable while the crispr cas system is favored under nutrient poor conditions as the cells then only rarely encounter a phage . could the phage onslaught result in a diversity of crispr cas immunity sufficient to over power escape phage development the teams set up a study to examine the relationship between crispr diversity and the systems effectiveness by mixing and infecting cultures consisting of different number of clonal strains where each strain had a different spacer matching the phage but were otherwise identical . the ability of a population with high diversity in crispr cas immunity to successful protect themselves from viral escape mutants may be a selection pressure driving the evolution of other anti crispr strategies . though anticipated after the discovery of the crispr cas immune system it took several years for the first cases of phage encoded anti crispr proteins to be described . indeed a dms3vir phage encoding an anti crispr protein affected high diversity crispr populations in the same manner as crispr monocultures demonstrating that the usefulness of crispr cas immunity is basically nullified .", " h nmr 400 mhz dmso d6 11.55 s 1h 11.46 s 1h 7.57 dd j 9 hz j 5 hz 2h 7.237.19 m 2h 6.59 d j 3 hz 1h . c nmr 100

abdominal ultrasound exam during a medical checkup . the pre contrast ct scan revealed a 4.5 cm in diameter smooth marginated solitary heterogeneous mass occupying the pancreatic neck and body fig . in addition two metastatic lesions 5.0 4.0 cm and 4.0 3.0 cm in size were found in the iii iv and vii hepatic segments . tumor resection that included the primary pancreatic neoplasm and the right hepatic metastatic mass was carried out . during chemotherapy the ct examination was repeated and it revealed no tumor recurrence in the pancreas . to the best of our knowledge there has been no report about primary yst arising in the pancreas and especially occurring in a 57year old woman . we present here the first case of primary yst arising in the pancreas with hepatic metastasis in an adult woman . this unique case is of value for reminding radiologists and oncologists to be aware of the diagnosis of yst when a patient presents with an extremely high level of afp and an oval shaped or multilobulated heterogeneous soft tissue mass is discovered in the pancreas displaying moderate and inhomogeneous enhancement on ct images .", " the most frequently affected anatomic area in the course of ra is the hand anatomically the hand is made up of the wrist metacarpus and fingers . rheumatoid hand in the patient with a long term ra at present due to the advancement of knowledge concerning the pathogenesis of ra and the development of diagnostic methods including imaging techniques such as ultrasound us and magnetic resonance imaging mri controlling the ailments and symptoms of the disease are not the only main aims of rheumatoid arthritis management . as a result we will observe the classical image of the rheumatoid hand deformed by the disease more and more rarely . rheumatoid arthritis affects the sites in which the synovial membrane may be found articular cavities bursae and sheaths and therefore all these sites are subject to a thorough evaluation . during us examination the following are assessed articular cavities in search for the signs of synovitis and effusions bone outlines in terms of geodes and erosions tendons and their sheaths searching for the signs of synovitis effusion and tendon damage and bursae in the hand below the second compartment of the extensors in search for synovitis and effusion . the hyperplasia of the intimal layer and inflammatory edema of the subintimal layer are visible in the form of synovial thickening figs . a coexistent joint effusion is frequently observed and contrary to the thickened synovium the effusion in the articular cavities sheaths and bursae results from the malfunction of the synovial membrane which is affected by inflammation . during us examination one should specify the localization of the pathologically altered synovium and determine whether the process is generalized e.g. depending on the moment at which us examination is performed the hyperemia of the synovium may not yet be visible some single vessels may be observed and finally the most typically for ra intensive vascularization of the synovium may be present . the analysis of the vascularization of the synovial membrane in pdus is of clinical significance which is proven by the correlations between synovitis assessed in pdus and the count of th17 proinflammatory and destructive lymphocytes in the synovial fluid of patients with ra . thickening of the synovium in the druj radiocarpal and midcarpal joints synovitis thickening of the synovium of the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon sheat tenosynovitis a. thickening with vascularization of the synovium of the mcp joint synovitis . the acute and active condition manifests itself with the hyperemia of the synovial sheath and hyperemia of the tendon . we are not familiar with radiological images x ray us or mri of early phases of rheumatoid diseases and without proper clinical data we can not differentiate between them yet . it allows for the diagnosis of early inflammatory lesions in the soft tissues of the joints . due to the fact that more and more patients report with an early stage of the disease whose advancement with a high probability may be hindered by the implemented therapy the significance of us examinations increase it prevents the differentiation of rheumatoid diseases from degenerative overuse or post traumatic changes such as overlap syndrome of ra and osteoarthritis or post traumatic arthritis .", " although the pathophysiologic mechanisms of osteoarthritis remain unresolved chondrocytes in oa cartilage demonstrated morphologic changes that are characteristic features of apoptosis which suggests apoptosis plays an important role in the development of oa 36 . after he staining chondrocytes cartilage surface cartilage matrix and tide line were observed with the microscope . the ihc stainings of cartilage matrix and chondrocyte were observed and photographed using an olympus microscope . five hundred chondrocytes were counted in every slide and per 1000 chondrocytes in different periods of each group . after he staining chondrocytes cartilage surface cartilage matrix and tide line were observed with the microscope . the ihc stainings of cartilage matrix and chondrocyte were observed and photographed using an olympus microscope . five hundred chondrocytes were counted in every slide and per 1000 chondrocytes in different periods of each group . in the 6 month the superficial layer of articular cartilage shed and there was a large amount of chondrocyte hyperplasia . the chondrocytes in the ns group decreased while the chondrocytes in the ce group slightly decreased . to the in group in the 3 month the layer of the cartilage became thinner and appeared villous . in the ibp group in the 9 month the thickness of the articular cartilage became thin and deteriorated . taken together ce inhibited chondrocyte apoptosis and retained the degeneration of cartilage while in and ibp promoted chondrocyte apoptosis and aggravated the degeneration of cartilage . in the ns and ce groups the chondrocytes of articular cartilage appeared similar . in the in group the electron density of

together ce inhibited chondrocyte apoptosis and retained the degeneration of cartilage while in and ibp promoted chondrocyte apoptosis and aggravated the degeneration of cartilage . in the in group the electron density of chondrocytes significantly increased and many had lytic necrosis . the pathological changes and the chemical indicators of cartilage in rat oa models which are noted in human oa have been widely used in the oa research . late in oa the balance between synthesis and degradation of type ii collagen is destroyed and the amount of type ii collagen in the cartilage matrix markedly decreases . in our study at the 3 6 and 9 months of treatment ce had no effect on the expression of the type ii collagen in oa chondrocytes which indicates ce possibly does not interfere with the metabolism of type ii collagen in articular cartilage when it plays a role in anti inflammatory and analgesics . moreover in inhibits the expression of type ii collagen in chondrocytes decreases the synthesis of type ii collagen and restrains the metabolism of type ii collagen in degenerative cartilage . in our study a high frequency of chondrocyte apoptosis existed in articular cartilage during oa . chondrocyte apoptosis is positively associated with degree of cartilage matrix damage which is consistent with previous reports 2527 . moreover ce suppressed chondrocyte apoptosis and retained the degeneration of articular cartilage while in and ibp promoted chondrocyte apoptosis and aggravated the degeneration of articular cartilage .", " on the second day of the study the same

patients were prepared by the above method and stimulated with 400 g of thyrotropin releasing hormone trh then blood sampling for gh was conducted every 30 min for two hours to determine the paradoxical response to trh administration . the positive response to a single administration of sms 201 995 was defined as more than a 50 suppression of gh from the basal level of gh at over 4 hours from the time of injection of 50g of sms 201 995 . the positive response groups for trh and ghrh were identified as those having over a twofold increase from baseline levels within 60 min after stimulation . the other two patients patients 4 and 5 had irregular curves of gh response which were not suppressed . the paradoxical response of gh to trh stimulation showed that 3 of 4 responders patients 1 2 and 8 had a paradoxically responded curve pattern on stimulation which peaked at 30 to 60 min after stimulation . patient 5 had no response on sms and trh stimulation and had high levels of gh with stimulation of trh over 200 ng ml . the gh response to ghrh stimulation in the responder group showed a tendency to gradually increase in a time dependent fashion but the response of this group did not conform to our positive response criteria . three patients of this group noted an increasing tendency of gh response curve but the remaining patient showed a flat pattern of the gh curve at the high level over 180 ng ml . in the responder group only one responder patient 2 showed a positive pattern of the gh diurnal curve the other three did not satisfy our positive criteria . but the non responder group had three patients with positive gh patterns during the 8 hour period of the study patients 3 4 and 5 . the other two patients patients 4 and 5 had irregular curves of gh response which were not suppressed . the paradoxical response of gh to trh stimulation showed that 3 of 4 responders patients 1 2 and 8 had a paradoxically responded curve pattern on stimulation which peaked at 30 to 60 min after stimulation . patient 5 had no response on sms and trh stimulation and had high levels of gh with stimulation of trh over 200 ng ml . the gh response to ghrh stimulation in the responder group showed a tendency to gradually increase in a time dependent fashion but the response of this group did not conform to our positive response criteria . three patients of this group noted an increasing tendency of gh response curve but the remaining patient showed a flat pattern of the gh curve at the high level over 180 ng ml . in the responder group only one responder patient 2 showed a positive pattern of the gh diurnal curve the other three did not satisfy our positive criteria . observed paradoxical response of gh to trh might originate from the presence of dedifferentiated gh receptors of the gh producing cells in acromegalic patients . therefore we investigated the gh secretory patterns to various stimuli and to circadian rhythm in a group of 4 responders to sms 201 995 and a group of 4 non responders . the observed results showed that there was no correlation between gh paradoxical response to trh stimulation ghrh stimulation and sms 201 995 responsiveness . these patients might be considered to have normal or increased somatostatin levels and excessive secretion of ghrh might be the primary event .", " biomarkers for sepsis associated with the endothelial glycocalyx remain relatively unknown however and this commentary attempts to reverse this omission . given the fundamental but perhaps relatively overlooked role of the endothelial glycocalyx in regulating vascular integrity and functions central to the pathophysiology of sepsis identifying interventions aimed at protecting or repairing it might prove a promising therapeutic target . some clinically established therapies used for the treatment of sepsis such as glucose control and steroid administration and also approaches used in experimental studies such as tnf inhibition antithrombin iii infusion of albumin and avoidance of natriuretic peptide release are known to reduce glycocalyx disruption . future endeavours in the field of sepsis research which are urgently required should not only include components of the endothelial glycocalyx in the list of biomarkers but also consider their potential as therapeutic targets for the development of new therapies .", " several naturally occurring and synthetic ar inhibitors with diverse structures have been studied in experimental animals and clinical trials to determine their effectiveness in preventing cataract formation and diabetic complications . the current study aimed to evaluate the ar and age inhibitory of p. vulgaris extract . the extract was suspended in distilled water and partitioned sequentially with n hexane methylene chloride ch2cl2 ethyl acetate etoac and n butanol buoh respectively . since the etoac fraction showed the ar inhibitory activity this fraction 2.2 g was further purified by using a medium pressure liquid chromatography lichroprep rp18 glass column 36 460 mm 2540 m particle size mobile phase meoh h2o 40 to 50 flow rate 10 to 5 ml min resulted in the isolation of compounds 1 102.8 mg 2 53.3 mg 3 10.6 mg and 4 27.9 mg . the present study was conducted to identify new potential rar inhibitors from p. vulgaris which might have potential uses in the treatment of diabetic complications . in order to identify the active compounds from p. vulgaris the extract was divided into several fractions that were tested for their rar inhibitory activity . the etoac fraction had high inhibitory activity against rar with ic50 value of 2.99 0.10 g ml . previous studies used quercetin as a positive control when comparing the inhibitory activity of active compounds isolated from natural products against lens or human recombinant aldose reductase 9 30 31 . we compared the inhibition of rar and rhar by compounds 16 and quercetin a natural aldose reductase inhibitor . to determine the type of inhibition activity produced by compounds 4 and 5 a kinetic study was conducted using dl glyceraldehyde as a substrate concentration 0.11 mm at 3 different concentrations for each compound . the results indicated that the inhibition type of rhar by rosmarinic acid 4 and caffeic acid ethylene ester 5 was noncompetitive showing that the inhibitor was unable to bind to either the substrate binding region or the nadph binding region of rhar . we also studied the effects of compounds 4 and 5 on galactitol accumulation in rat erythrocytes and lenses table 3 . compounds 4 and 5 inhibited galactitol accumulation in rat erythrocyte by almost 35.5 and 31.7 at 5 g ml respectively . the etoac fraction had high inhibitory activity against age with an ic50 value of 141.34 1.27 g ml showing almost the same activity with positive control table 4 . p hydroxycinnamic acid 3 had the strongest inhibitory activity with an ic50 value of 5.94 1.01 m and caffeic acid ethylene ester 5 also had potent inhibitory activity with an ic50 value of 10.52 0.28 m compared to a positive control ic50 value of 15.34 0.40 m see tables 6 and 7 . specifically this compound exhibited the most potent inhibition with age with an ic50 of 33.16 0.54 m . these results suggest that this compound and p. vulgaris could potentially provide a new natural treatment for diabetic complications .", " the study design included a one group internal comparison in which each intersection acted as its own control through comparison of the number of pedestrian motor vehicle collisions per intersection month before and after pcs installation . motor vehicle collision records were excluded from the analysis if 1 the location code eg intersection mid block was

outside a 30m radius of the intersection where a pcs was installed 5 the collision occurred on the same day the pcs was installed and 6 the collision occurred at an intersection where there was less

at signalised intersections where a pcs was eventually installed . this study also found no negative impact of pcs on collision counts which is similar to the findings of botha et al.10 where the work of botha et al10 was limited by a small sample size low statistical power and a short post pcs installation period the sample size of this study addressed these concerns . it is an exploratory research study on the relationship between pcs and collisions in toronto . the results are based on controlled intersections where a pcs was installed over the study period and does not examine collisions that occurred at adjacent uncontrolled unchanged intersections or road segments in toronto . the installation of pcs at 1965 signalised intersections in toronto did not reduce the frequency of pedestrian motor vehicle collisions at these intersections . this is the first population based study to describe the effectiveness of pcs at reducing pedestrian motor vehicle collisions over a 10year period . this study provides evidence that the installation of pcs in toronto canada was not associated with a reduction in pedestrian motor vehicle collisions . this is the first population

were clearly related to pah it is unclear what proportion of so called pah unrelated hospitalizations were truly incidental or precipitated by the pah comorbidity to some extent . fewer differences at enrollment distinguished between patients with pah related and pah unrelated hospitalizations although patients with pah related hospitalizations presented with more severe pah at the time of first admission . the lack of differences between the pah related and pah unrelated groups at enrollment is an important point given our finding that both in hospital and postdischarge survival are significantly worse for patients hospitalized for pah related reasons despite the similar frequencies at which pah related and pah unrelated hospitalizations occur . even for patients with no hospitalizations in the first year after enrollment almost one half experience at least one hospitalization over the subsequent 3 years despite treatment of pah indicating that surviving the first

that produce intracranial hypertension imaging in recent years has been shown to detect changes involving the orbit sella and sinovenous system providing important clues to the diagnosis . we describe the case of a lady with chronic headache where magnetic resonance imaging mri showed features suggestive of iih and in addition highlight the dramatic reversal of these findings following csf drainage allowing diagnosis to be made with certainty . post lp the optic nerve straightens with some reduction in the perioptic fluid b saggital images of the sella show partial empty sella a which following

schizophrenia the symptom response is not always optimal side effects are frequent and treatment adherence is often poor 2 4 . in one study the concentration of zn in scalp hair of patients with schizophrenia was significantly lower than that in healthy volunteers 27 . reduced serum zn levels have also been reported in patients with schizophrenia 28 . to the best of our knowledge thus far the efficacy of zn in the treatment of schizophrenia has not been investigated in clinical trials . the purpose of the present study was to assess the efficacy of zn sulfate as an adjuvant therapy in the

obtained in the present trial demonstrate that adding zn to an atypical antipsychotic regimen is effective in the improvement of symptoms of schizophrenia and risk of aggression in patients with schizophrenia . the zn group had significantly greater improvement in total score of panss positive and negative symptoms and risk of aggression over the 6week trial . to the best of our knowledge this study was the first double blind and placebo controlled clinical trial investigating the efficacy of zn in the treatment of schizophrenia . so far positive effects of supplemental zn on depression 15 36 37 ocd 6 adhd 14 31 and ad 11 have been reported in other studies . this leads us to assume that the therapeutic effect observed by zn sulfate on symptoms of schizophrenia is likely to result from a pharmacodynamic mechanism . however a recent meta analysis did not find significant therapeutic benefits in addition of benzodiazepines to the antipsychotic regimen of schizophrenic

sexual partners to disclose to them and then of their own disclosure practices with partners . a subset of ocs study participants broadly representative of the demographics of hiv prevalence in ontario were then invited to be interviewed to gain further insight into perceptions of disclosure expectations and responsibilities . questions asked about recent sexual interactions and the circumstances leading to nondisclosure as well as a subsequent specific question there is a lot of debate about people s responsibility to disclose their hiv status . questions added to the two large cohort studies show the expectations of people living with hiv regarding their disclosure to sexual partners and partners disclosure to them table 2 . the most frequent overlap of responses was 15 of those who indicated it was not necessary to tell a partner because they had protected sex also checked off that they tell some partners that they were hiv positive but not others . overall 18.3 do not expect a sexual partner to disclose hiv status but this varies by sexual orientation with gay men having less expectation 26.7 followed by bisexual men 23.1 heterosexual men 10.0 and finally heterosexual women having the greatest expectation that sexual partners will disclose 5.1 p .015 . the expectation that sexual partners will not disclose is 20.3 among white people 11.1 among african and caribbean people and 8.9 among aboriginal people p .048 . between 1 and 9 report alternative strategies to disclosure including not telling any partners telling some partners and dropping hints

sex 16.4 p .0001 feel it is unnecessary to disclose because a partner should presume everyone is positive 8.0 p .002 because a partner is willing to have unprotected sex 5.5p .013 or because it is a partner s responsibility to use a condom 7.5 p .0001 . most hiv positive people in this survey then either disclose to or do not have partners who are hiv negative or of unknown status . non disclosure strategies and assumptions are reported by relatively small sets of people with some variation according to employment status sexual orientation gender ethnicity and having had a casual partner . 041 african caribbean heterosexual male 40s others experience disclosure as an obligation that runs against a tacit norm of silence around hiv questions a few times i have disclosed or they ve asked me flat out are you positive or negative and i will tell them but often it s not discussed . 013 white gay male 50s as far as i can see from people i ve talked to i d say 99.9 of the people

personal interactions.the last time was in a bathhouse situation . i like you did as much as possible without saying it to infer that you were it might sound like beating around the bush but i really did kind of like i mean do i have to fucking write it on my forehead for real i probably told more before but now i m very wary because i do nt know sometimes when i m chatting to somebody i ll kind of drop some hints and if they do nt seem to pick it up then i ll just walk away because i ll say well i do nt think this person is positive so you know what i m just going to leave it people who are hiv that i ve had discussions with also feel under siege and maybe less likely to bring up some things or just to look for totally anonymous sex where not even your name is asked . i like you did as

context where men are presumed to be largely in the know about hiv issues can lead to the inference that the other may also be an hiv positive man who is cautious about disclosing.if someone wants to do something unprotected that s a big signal . 022 white gay male 40sfrom a gay s perspective we know generally you know when i do nt ask or they do nt ask it s a given we re both hiv and we re going to have probably unprotected sex if he says i ll only play wrapped then i will respect that and play wrapped . 022 white gay male 40s from a gay s perspective we know generally you know when i do nt

sometime tacit assumptions can lead to misunderstanding or to the perception of outright deception reported by some individuals as the circumstance that led to their own exposure to hiv i asked him if he had ever been tested and like the phrasing i would have used was are you clean and then i went and got all my tests done and then he was like i did that too. 073 white queer female 20s i went in for standard blood work because it s required by our insurance company and they said well you re hiv positive and i said that s impossible because i ve only been playing around with two people and one is my partner of four years and the other one is a friend of ours . 018 white gay male 40s those interviewed for this study then point toward a number of circumstances and factors that make routine disclosure a complex and emotionally difficult accomplishment . some seek to resolve disclosure problems by pursuing other hiv positive people for sexual or romantic connection . 030 african caribbean heterosexual male 30s others believe that when having sex with a partner who is also hiv positive safer sex is less of a concern or experience a sense of relief at no longer having to feel like a pariah.i got mixed up and had a bit of a crystal meth problem and through that i met there s a whole community of guys who were just on disability never worked did nt seem to want to work again . 089 asian gay male 20s the pressure to disclose then produces a disparate array of effects in everyday interaction heightened fear of rejection that makes disclosure even harder to accomplish indirect or partial disclosure readings of tacit signs and assumptions about partners sero statuses and avoidance of the need to disclose by pursuing other hiv positive partners . 024 african caribbean gay male 40si do nt think the onus should be on the person who s positive necessarily or the person who knows that they re positive . 024 african caribbean gay male 40s i do nt think the onus should be on the person who s positive necessarily or the person who knows that they re positive . 016 white gay male 60swhat shocked me was the fact that somebody would have sex with another person without letting him or her know that they re hiv and that there s a possibility of transmission . 016 white gay male 60s what shocked me was the fact that somebody would have sex with another person without letting him or her know that they re hiv and that there s a possibility of transmission . at the same time increasing reliance on the criminal justice system to enforce a principle of near universal disclosure of hiv positive status even when transmission is unlikely presses hiv positive people into an untenable double bind they must place themselves into the risky position of heightening the possibility of rejection stigmatization and prosecution . as interviews with people living with hiv show examination of everyday disclosure decisions shows a range of incommensurable rationalities that shape these decisions such as personal ethics and morality ethical precepts circulating in the larger society the fear of rejection degree of intimacy between partners and capacity for self assertion as factors in disclosure dynamics . as well it may create a generalized expectation that hiv positive people will always disclose and therefore condom use is unnecessary because non disclosure comes to signify hiv negative status . obscured by criminalization trends is the fact that protected sex especially in a situation where treatment has succeeded in attaining an undetectable viral load in the hiv positive partner continues to be a much more reliable method of avoiding hiv as well as several other sexually transmitted infections than disclosure . the elevation of disclosure to a primary strategy for hiv prevention then exerts increasing pressure on a double bind that can not be relied on to result in decreased hiv risk and may divert attention from or undermine safe sex practice .", " the use of pharmacogenomics in patients requiring pain management can lead to more efficient opioid selection dose optimization and minimization of adrs to improve patient outcome . genetic variants such as 3435c t in p glycoprotein have been associated with variability of pain relief in cancer patients treated with morphine . clinically relevant pharmacogenomic targets for pain management the cytochrome p450 cyp system is responsible for metabolizing a wide range of therapeutic agents used for pain relief . as a result genetic polymorphisms in ugt2b7 have been shown to decrease the hepatic clearance of morphine which translates into lower dosage requirements of morphine . as a result genetic variability in the comt gene can contribute to differences in pain sensitivity and response to analgesics . the 118a g polymorphism in this gene results in less effective opioid analgesia as reported with cancer patients with homozygous variant alleles gg who required higher morphine doses for pain relief than homozygous wild type aa participants . finally a significant relationship between the degree of pain relief and the 118a g genotypes was shown in cancer patients being treated with morphine over the first 2 months of therapy . in the first 7 days of morphine treatment patients homozygous for the wild type allele aa had more pronounced decrease in pain from baseline than those who were homozygous variants gg whose response was almost undetectable . pharmacogenomic polymorphisms are definitely important in the interindividual variability in the analgesic effects and occurrence of adrs of commonly used medications prescribed for pain management but genetic factors will provide only a partial answer to the interindividual variability observed . other factors including biological variations ethnicity age and gender environmental factors smoking status co morbidity and co medications potential for drug drug interactions must be considered along with the genetic variations because together they all affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of medications used for pain management . additional studies are also needed to characterize the combined effects of multiple genes along with demographic and clinical variables in selecting the appropriate opioid and predicting the appropriate opioid dose in patients with pain . in the near future pharmacogenomic approaches in pain management could lead to individualized therapy to best select the appropriate analgesic from the onset to provide sustained efficacy with the lowest side effect profile .", " studied temporal recalibration by exposing participants to 3 min of sound and light flashes with a constant time lag after which an av toj or av simultaneity task was performed . following exposure observers were given av test stimuli and judged whether the sound or the light came first or whether the sound and light were simultaneous or successive . the results showed that the point of subjective simultaneity pss the point of perceived temporal alignment between the sound and the light was shifted in the direction of the exposure lag . so following exposure to a train of sound first stimulus pairs participants perceived sound first trials as more simultaneous than after light first exposure . the authors adapted participants to asynchronous tone flash stimulus pairs and later tested them on the bounce illusion sekuler et al . tactile temporal recalibration by exposing participants to streams of brief auditory and tactile stimuli presented in synchrony or else with the auditory stimulus leading by 75 ms . rather than a shift in the pss they observed that the jnd to resolve audio tactile temporal order was larger after exposure to the desynchronized streams than after exposure to the synchronous streams . the goal of the present study was to explore whether spatial disparity between a sound and light affects temporal recalibration . in their study a visual toj task was used with a sound presented before the first and after the second light . they embedded two sounds that normally enhance sensitivity on the visual temporal order judgement task in a sequence of flanker sounds which either had the same or different frequency rhythm or location . by combining principles of auditory grouping with intersensory pairing they also demonstrated that the capture sounds could counter intuitively be more effective when their locations differed from that of the lights rather than when they came from the same position thus demonstrating that sound location mattered for auditory grouping but not intersensory pairing . participants were exposed for 3 min to a train of asynchronous sounds and lights that came either from the same or a different location . first we could test whether temporal recalibration is affected by spatial disparity between the sounds and lights . observing an after effect following exposure to spatially disparate sound light pairs would provide strong evidence that spatial co occurrence is even at this early stage not necessary for intersensory pairing to occur . here we tested whether spatial similarity between the exposure and test sound affects after effects . the subject was exposed to a sound light pair with 100 ms temporal offset either sound first or light first . sounds of

program nxsensor available at that locates nxss in dna and defines regions where nucleosomes are unlikely to be formed because of the presence of such sequences and their spacing at distances less than the number of base pairs in the nucleosome . the nxsensor program annotates individual dna regions by marking nxss and then examining their spacing to find sequences between nxss that are 147 bp in length on the assumption that nucleosomes are unlikely to form in such regions . to test the general validity of the nxss chosen and to test the ability of the nxsensor program to find and annotate such sequences the dna sequences of positioned nucleosomes listed in the nucleosome positioning region database nprd were examined 18 . these two sets of genes were chosen in order to assess the potential distribution of nucleosomes in promoters of genes that are used differently in different tissues to substantiate the conclusions of other researchers who have recently investigated this question using different approaches and to demonstrate further the usefulness of the nxsensor tool . in cases where no oligo capped cdna clones were available from the dbtss 21 of 100 hk genes 36 of 100 ts genes nucleosome segments option of nxsensor annotates the submitted sequence by highlighting in gray the segments available for nucleosome binding leaving open the segments unlikely to be bound to nucleosomes by virtue of the number and positions of nxss figure 1 and supplementary figure 1 . nxscore defined as the number of nxss in a window of 147 bp at a given position within the 2000 base promoter region estimates the likelihood that nucleosomes are excluded from promoter regions at different distances from the tss . a direct comparison of the average number of nxss per window of 147 bases in hk and ts promoter regions is shown in figure 2 . there was a significant difference between hk gene promoters and ts gene promoters in the mean number of nxss in the specific 147 bp window centered on the tss hk 2.10 and ts 0.82 p 0.01 kolmogorov supplementary figure 2 gives an illustrative example of 10 000 bases around the tss of a hk gene in which nxsensor analysis suggests that essentially only the tss region is free of nucleosomes . figure 2 also shows that the mean number of nxss in this window for the hk genes was significantly higher than that expected for random sequence dna with the same base composition as the hk gene promoter regions 2.10 for hk genes 0.53 for the corresponding random sequence dna p 0.0014 . in contrast the mean number of nxss in this window for the ts genes was hardly different from the nxss expected in random sequence dna having the ts promoter base composition 0.82 for ts genes 0.22 for the corresponding random sequence dna p 0.06 . from nxsensor output we obtained accessibility scores as shown in figure 3a there was a significant difference between the distributions of accessibility scores of hk genes and of ts genes the hk genes having significantly higher accessibility scores than the ts genes p 0.01 kolmogorov further analysis was conducted using a modified accessibility score acc50 which includes sequences at least 50 bp in length likely to be nucleosome free . nucleosome formation potential scores have recently been used to demonstrate differences in the intergenic regions 28 and more specifically in the promoter regions 29 of human hk and ts genes . in a set of hk and ts promoter region dna sequences nxsensor analysis has demonstrated that the promoter regions of hk genes are likely to be relatively nucleosome free a finding that may help to explain the wide tissue distribution of their expression . this is in contrast to those of ts genes whose promoter regions contain sequences more favorable for nucleosome formation 2829 and which are therefore likely to require additional ts transcription factors to modify or displace nucleosomes before the genes can be expressed . the greater frequency of nxss of the g c3n23 type in hk gene promoter regions compared with ts gene promoter regions is partly a reflection of the higher gc content of the former 56.86 g c in hk 50.44 g c in ts . these two observations show that the frequency of both types of nxs in hk gene promoters is higher than would be expected from their base composition suggesting a functional significance possibly related to nucleosome exclusion . the minimum length of nucleosome free sequence can be increased to accommodate the space required for larger protein complexes an approach we took to show that the region immediately surrounding tsss of hk genes is likely to be more accessible to the basal transcription apparatus than is the corresponding region of ts genes .", " cases of primary colonic malt lymphoma reported in korea have presented as multiple submucosal tumors one case4 a nonpedunculated protruding polypoid mass four cases5678 obstructive lesions of the colon caused by mucosal edema or a tumor two cases910 or mucosal discoloration one case.11 here we report the case of a colonic malt lymphoma presenting as a semipedunculated polyp that was removed by endoscopic mucosal resection emr . malt lymphoma a subtype of non hodgkin lymphoma is classified as an extranodal marginal zone b cell lymphoma and is a lymphoepithelial lesion characterized by epithelial infiltration by lymphoplasma cells.12 malt lymphoma of the stomach is known to be associated with helicobacter pylori infection11 whereas nongastric malt lymphomas have been associated with borrelia burgdorferi chlamydia psittaci hepatitis c virus campylobacter jejuni and autoimmune disease.12 colonic malt lymphoma occurs at an average age of 59.8 years and shows no sex preference . however in some rare cases intestinal obstruction or intussusception can appear.9101314 systemic symptoms such as fever and weight loss are rare because most malt lymphomas are well localized and slow growing.12 according to endoscopic findings a malt lymphoma of the colon usually appears as a sessile protruding lesion or ulcerative lesion and the former is approximately 10 times more common than the latter.1415 sites of tumor growth have been reported to be the cecum 71.5 rectum 16.9 and ascending colon 6.2 however the sigmoid colon is only rarely affected.16 eight cases have been reported in korea and these are summarized in table 1 . a malt lymphoma can be diagnosed during surgery or endoscopic biopsy . however malt lymphoma usually presents as a single lesion whereas mantle cell lymphoma presents as multiple lymphomatous polyposis in the gastrointestinal tract and without lymphoepithelial lesions.18 immunohistochemically these two types can be differentiated by the cyclin d1 status because malt lymphomas and mantle cell lymphomas are immunonegative and immunopositive for cyclin d1 respectively.14 in our case histological findings showed that lymphoepithelial lesions were caused by the invasion of the mucosa by atypical lymphocytes and that they were cyclin d1 negative with a ki67 labeling index of 10 to 20 which indicated a diagnosis of low grade malt lymphoma . in the described case malt lymphoma presented as a semipedunculated polyp during colonoscopy and diagnosis and treatment planning were performed on the basis of the results of emr . more case reports and studies about colonic malt lymphoma presenting with variable morphology are needed to establish guidelines for the treatment of colonic malt lymphomas in the near future .", " in the histological qualitative analysis the graft

again in pregnancy the pro oxidant effects of chronic al exposure disrupt normal development in baby rats . however one of the most sensitive targets of al toxicity is the nervous system . neurotoxic effects of al have been indicated from various treatments with different salts of al that have resulted in oxidative damage to a range of cellular biomolecules such as lipids proteins and nucleic acids . at the same time although al absorption from the diet is low in animals and human al can form complexes with citrate and transferrin which can then cross the blood brain barrier to affect the brain . after systemic intravenous al exposure in rats and rabbits the extracellular al concentrations were seen to increase primarily in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of the brain . from further studies in rats the neurochemical changes caused by al in the brain depend on the duration of the exposure and are region specific with memory and learning disorders being reported in mice al has been shown to cause oxidative stress in the brain . when applied to cultured human brain cells according to the time and concentration of the al exposure reductions in cell growth rates were seen . in terms of the effects of al on the functions of the brain in the rat it was reported that the impaired neural function caused by al is related to its damage to intracellular ca homeostasis . this is again focused on the hippocampus with spongiform changes to the neurons seen which appear to be an important mechanism in al neurotoxicity . of particular relevance for the developmental aspects investigated in the present study the use of the al radioisotope have provided a tracer to demonstrate that following its subcutaneous injection in pregnant and lactating rats considerable amounts were then found in the brain and particularly the cell nucleus fraction of both the mother and foetus . indeed an earlier study investigating the effects of al in the ontogenetic development of cholinergic and serotonin neurotransmitter receptors in the brain demonstrated that not only is the time of exposure to al important for the effects seen but also the timing of the exposure . in the present study we therefore investigated the oxidative and histopathological damage induced by al during the development of the chick brain as applied from the beginning of the incubation period of eggs of ross broiler chicks . in the present study we focused in particular on the neurotoxic effects of al in terms of the growth and development of the brain with the exposure of developing chicks to al . indeed in an in vitro study of the toxic effects of al on human embryonic cerebral neurocytes increases in lipid peroxides were seen which were indicative of the neurotoxic effects of al being caused by lipid peroxidation and the resultant damage to the membranes . similarly as indicated above with the developing mouse brain al exposure of the foetus via al treatment of the mother leads to inhibitory effects on post partum development in general seen as decreased weight and body length in the pups and delayed neurobehavioral development . from a biochemical viewpoint in the developing rat exposed to al from the treated mother through lactation increased lipid peroxidation was seen in both the cerebrum and cerebellum of pup brains which was accompanied by decreases in superoxide dismutase and catalase activities . thus these effects of al have been seen at the level of the cerebral cortex 3135373841 hippocampus cerebellum medulla oblongata hypothalamus and brain stem . thus the biochemical data for al treatment in this chick embryonic development model are in parallel with these indicators of increased lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage although at this level it remains to be seen within which regions of the developing chick brain these neurotoxic effects might be focused . similarly histopathological examinations of the hippocampus in 2 rat models following al treatment showed marked changes in general brain histology as indicated by an increased number of vacuolated spaces and more specifically effects on the neuronal connectivity in the hippocampus . with these al effects seen on the hippocampus a brain damage model for the investigation of learning and memory functions was recently reported that was established via intragastric administration of elemental al in adult rats . thus various studies in the literature using some specific adult animal models support these neurotoxic effects of al seen in the present study for this model of the developing chick brain .", " the risk of rd is 4 times higher in patients who have undergone cataract surgery 5 6 . even in a successful rd surgery with a clinically normal macular area poor visual acuity va color vision defects and metamorphopsia have been described in successful postoperative rd macula on surgeries suggesting the existence of microstructural retina damage . the purpose of this report is to analyze those macula on rd cases that were anatomical successful treated but experienced loss of vision at the third month of follow up . for this present analysis only patients with a macula on rd at the time of the surgery and the macula on during the entire follow up were included . cases of preoperative pvr grade c1 or higher according to the retina society classification and posttraumatic rd were excluded . group 2 g2 n 53 included macula on patients with reattached retina and who experienced visual loss at the third month of follow up . the main preoperative characteristics recorded for g2 g3 and g4 were retinal breaks type tear hole dialysis and giant tear size of retinal breaks in clock hours extension of rd in quadrants presence of preoperative pvr less than grade c previous aphakia previous vitreous hemorrhage posterior vitreous detachment myopia and preoperative visual acuity table 1 . in g1 345 eyes 96.6 95ci 9498.2 had reattached retinas at the end of follow up . the preoperative va in g1 was 20100 in 44 patients 12.3 95ci 8.9 15.7 between 20100 and 2040 in 79 eyes 22.1 95ci 17.8 26.4 and 2040 in 234 eyes 65.6 95ci 60.6 70.5 table 2 . the postoperative va in this group at the end of the follow up was 20100 in 37 eyes 10.4 95ci 7.2 13.5 between 20100 and 2040 in 80 eyes 22.4 95ci 18.1 26.7 and 2040 in 240 eyes 67.2 95ci 62.4 72.1 . in g2 table 1 which included phakic and pseudophakic eyes with reattached retinas and visual loss the final va 0.23 0.14 was lower than the initial va 0.65 0.25 p 0.0001 paired t test despite reattachment of the retina . in the preoperative va evaluation 82.1 of eyes n 32 had 2040 and none of them had 20100 but at the end of the third month 30.8 n 12 had 20100 . while there are published data regarding the improvement of anatomical results of rd surgery there are few reports showing whether or not rd surgery results in functional improvement 911 13 14 23 24 and to the best of our knowledge there is only a report regarding visual loss in macula on rd after successful surgery . for rd certain variables are thought to be significant predictors for functional outcome for instance the status of the macula which is the most important factor macular elevation when detached and other factors such as age of the patient 9 25 poor initial vision 9 25 and interval between onset of rd and surgery 23 2729 . however we have experienced macula on rd cases in which despite successful surgery the visual results were not favorable . in this study 53 out of 357 patients 14.9 95ci 11.419.1 meeting the inclusion criteria experienced a worsening of va after rd surgery although the macula was attached . the american academy of ophthalmology has recognized that the status of the macula is the major factor related to visual prognosis . it is acknowledged that the time interval to surgery is crucial to prevent progression of subretinal fluid into the macula and disruption of the photoreceptors causing a possible loss of va in some cases . for our patients with macula on rds the evaluations were made only by indirect ophthalmoscopy or fundus biomicroscopy at 24 or 48 hours prior to the surgery . it is possible that systematic analysis of the status of the macula by oct may increase the number of macula off patients and also that structural changes in patients with visual loss could be detected . as mentioned we did not perform oct on patients preoperatively to rule out a subclinical extension of subretinal fluid under the fovea a reason which could explain why some eyes with similar alterations have functional results significantly better than others . neither epiretinal membranes nor cystoid macular edema which are also causes of visual loss after rd surgery was identified in the follow up . first is that the study design was not intended to solve the question of vision loss in patients with macula on rd but in view of the lack of reports on va loss after macula on rd surgery we have considered that our data could be interesting .", " in particular ros are involved in the diclofenac induced apoptosis of cultured gastric cells as well as in nephrotoxicity in vivo 9 10 furthermore an oxidative injury causes the mitochondrial permeability transition in diclofenac treated hepatocytes . in this paper we have investigated the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in the mechanism of diclofenac induced apoptosis in the neuroblastoma cell line sh sy5y . our data show that the treatment of the neuroblastoma cell line sh sy5y with diclofenac induces a decrease in sod2 protein level and an increase of the ros concentration . to analyse the time dependent increase of apoptosis sh sy5y cells were exposed to 150 m diclofenac and analysed at different times . therefore we have decided to investigate whether diclofenac affects the intracellular ros levels also in sh sy5y cells using the fluorescent probe dcfh da . indeed when these cells were incubated with diclofenac and dcfh da at different times an early increase of the ros level was detected with respect to control cells furthermore ros production progressively continued at least up to 4 hours figure 2 . as sod2 is the primary antioxidant enzyme in mitochondria protecting cells from oxidative injuries we have evaluated the role exerted by this enzyme in sh sy5y cells in the course of diclofenac treatment . to this aim the dose and time dependent effects of this drug on sod2 protein levels of sh sy5y cells were analysed in the experiments reported in figure 3 . when these neuronal cells were incubated for 24 hours with increasing diclofenac concentrations a dose dependent decrease of the sod2 protein level was observed as evaluated by western blotting using antibodies against human sod2 figure 3a . to investigate the possibility that the reduction of the sod2 protein levels corresponded also to a decrease in sod activity the protein extracts obtained from cells incubated with 150 m diclofenac were analysed at different times using a sod activity gel which allows the detection of the activity of both mitochondrial sod2 and cytosolic sod1 . we also evaluated whether the diclofenac induced decrease of sod2 levels activity depends on a down regulation of the corresponding mrna . to this aim sh sy5y cells were incubated in the presence or in the absence of 150 m diclofenac for 4 8 and 24 hours . the data presented in figure 5 indicate that the diclofenac treatment did not significantly alter the mrna levels of sod2 at all times investigated . when sh sy5y cells were treated with 150 m diclofenac the sod2 protein level was significantly reduced . in particular in the presence of 10 m sstrx the apoptosis of the diclofenac treated cells was reduced at all times investigated . to better evaluate the molecular mechanisms underlying the diclofenac induced apoptosis in sh sy5y cells the efficiency of the mitochondrial function was evaluated through measurements of its membrane potential using the fluorescent probe r123 . as shown in figure 8 the mitochondrial incorporation of r123 in sh sy5y cells treated with 150 m diclofenac underwent a significant reduction compared to that measured on untreated cells . a deeper insight on the involvement of mitochondria in the diclofenac induced apoptosis was realised with a western blotting analysis aimed at the evaluation of the cytochrome c release from mitochondria . interestingly the cytochrome c was already present after a 8hour incubation mainly in the cytosolic fraction of diclofenac treated cells moreover the amount of this mitochondrial marker in the cytosol significantly increased after a 24hour treatment figure 9a . this behaviour was confirmed by the concomitant analysis on the mitochondrial fraction where a reduction of the cytochrome c level was observed in the diclofenac treated cells figure 9b . these data indicate that cytochrome c is released from the mitochondria as a consequence of the diclofenac treatment of sh sy5y cells . for these reasons in our in vitro studies we have used a diclofenac concentration of 150 m because this value corresponded to the maximal concentration of this compound not causing cytotoxicity as determined by cytotoxicity assays on sh sy5y cells . an alteration of the ros levels was already demonstrated in diclofenac induced apoptosis in gastric and renal cells 9 10 . these results prompted us to evaluate the downstream effects of altered ros levels in the course of diclofenac treatment of sh sy5y cells . our data on sh sy5y cells show that diclofenac impairs sod2 functions thus suggesting that this enzyme is involved in the apoptotic mechanism induced by the drug . in particular this process is associated to a significant and concomitant reduction of both protein level and enzymatic activity of sod2 whereas rt pcr experiments showed that the corresponding mrna levels are not affected by the diclofenac treatment . therefore a transcriptional regulation of the sod2 gene by diclofenac could be excluded probably an increased degradation of the protein levels could explain the reduced activity of the enzyme . the increased ros level the low functionality of the mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme sod2 together with a partial recovery of sod2 properties by a heterelogous thioredoxin strongly suggest the involvement of mitochondria in the diclofenac induced apoptosis of sh sy5y cells . also in our system the diclofenac treatment induces an early mitochondrial hypopolarization correlated to an increase of the intracellular ros levels both events representing typical features of the onset of mitochondrial apoptosis . our data showed that cytochrome c translocates from the mitochondria to the cytosol during the diclofenac treatment of sh sy5y cells . this finding together with the mitochondrial membrane depolarization provides a more direct link between mitochondria and diclofenac induced apoptosis thus confirming that the programmed cell death in sh sy5y follows the mitochondrial pathway .", " there are no reports of illnesses caused by e. coli in farmed fish but resistant strains may be selected due to the presence of antibiotics in the culture environment leading to the dissemination by mobile genetic elements of

resistance was potentially chromosomal or plasmidial and d determine the multiple antibiotic resistance index of strains isolated from gills muscle and body surface . the susceptibility of the e. coli strains was tested in relation to several families of antibiotics including the aminoglycoside family amikacin ami 30 g and gentamicin gen 10 g the carbapenem family imipenem imp 30 g the cephalosporin family cephalothin cet 30 g and cefotaxime ctx 30 g the fluoroquinolone family ciprofloxacin cip 5 g the monobactam family aztreonam atm 30 g the penicillin family ampicillin amp 30 g the quinolone family nalidixic acid nal 30 g the sulfonamide family sulfametoxazol trimetoprim sut 25 g and the tetracycline family tetracycline tc 30 g . the multiple antibiotic resistance mar index was determined for the total number of e. coli strains from each type of tissue sampled gills muscle and body surface using the formula ab c where a is the total resistance score of the strains b is the total number of families of antibiotics tested and c is the number of strains from each type of tissue sampled . forty four of the isolates were confirmed to be e. coli 25 56.82 of which were isolated from gills 15 34.09 from the body surface and 4 9.09 from muscle . eleven e. coli strains isolated from gills and body surface were resistant to amp sut and tc especially to last of these gills n 4 surface n 3 . add that e. coli is commonly found in the gut of the tilapia thus to these authors its presence in the muscle is an indication of poor handling practices . on the occurrence of e. coli in the gut of farmed nile tilapia the isolated strains were susceptible to ami atm ctx and gen matching our own findings and supporting the notion that these antibiotics are little used in aquaculture . not surprisingly tendencia and dela pea observed that the indiscriminate use of antibiotics in aquaculture has been paralleled by a significant increase in the number of reports of resistant bacteria isolated from aquaculture stock . the overall high antibiotic susceptibility of e. coli strains isolated from fresh marketed nile tilapia was satisfactory although the occasional finding of plasmid mediated resistance points to the need for close microbiological surveillance of the farming handling and marketing conditions of aquaculture products .", " the high dopamine level in this tumor is caused by a deficiency in dopamine beta hydroxylase which converts dopamine to norepinephrine . only two original articles and five case reports have reported the occurrence of dopamine secreting paragangliomas in the retroperitoneum around the adrenal glands 2 8 . our preoperative diagnosis was a dopamine producing paraganglioma in the right retroperitoneum . an immunohistochemical study showed that the tumor was positive for neuroendocrine markers such as cd56 synaptophysin and chromogranin . in consequence the clinical presentation of this tumor is different from that of a classical pheochromocytoma that secretes norepinephrine and epinephrine . as a result the patients with exclusively dopamine producing paraganglioma are mostly asymptomatic at initial diagnosis . clinicians should not rule out the possibility of this rare tumor when evaluating adrenal masses with normal serum norepinephrine epinephrine and urinary vma levels even if the radiologic images strongly suggest a pheochromocytoma . dopamine secreting paragangliomas are more likely to present malignant features than classic catecholamine secreting type paragangliomas or pheochromocytomas . this rare tumor tends to be diagnosed in patients who are asymptomatic and the tumor is detected later than tumors that secrete norepinepnrine epinephrine or both . concerning the biochemical features one report suggests that the decreased activity of dopamine hydroxylase results in poor differentiation of this tumor which may explain why the dopamine secreting type shows advanced malignant features .", " an evaluation of the national hospital discharge survey and census date for vte in the united states reported an annual incidence of 0.49 per 10000 with peak rates in the neonatal period and adolescence.12 the majority of children with vte have multiple risk factors for thromboembolic disease at presentation such as catheter related thrombosis infection and congenital prothrombotic disorders.3 a pe is a very rare event in children but the mortality rate is reported to be approximately 10.4 hypereosinophilia is rarely associated with a pe in adults however this condition has not been reported in children . he had leukocytosis with eosinophilia peak ratio 35 thrombocytopenia minimum 33000mm and an elevated c reactive protein concentration 15.5 mg dl . on physical examination he had tachycardia 100 beats per minute tachypnea 39 breaths per minute and rales in the right lung field . the biochemical profile on admission was as follows hemoglobin 9.9 g dl white blood cell wbc count 19080mm with 32.8 eosinophils platelet count 64000mm erythrocyte sedimentation rate 6 mm hr and c reactive protein 9.2 mg dl . a diffuse decrease in perfusion in the right lung and a focal decrease in perfusion in the superior segment of the left lower lung the patient showed no evidence of allergic disease and parasitic infection for the elevated eosinophil count in the peripheral blood and bone marrow . his general condition gradually improved with the concomitant resolution of the pulmonary thromboembolism and pulmonary hypertension . fifteen months after admission the peripheral blood examination revealed the following findings hemoglobin 14.8 g dl wbc count 5920mm with 4.2 eosinophils and platelet count 230000mm . the patient had a high percentage of eosinophils at the onset of the thromboembolism . in conclusion we have presented a case of a pulmonary thromboembolism which was accompanied by idiopathic hypereosinophila in a child .", " the extent of association between anxiety depression and social support to hemodialysis patients has seldom been the subject of systematic enquiry . purpose of this study was to explore the effect of perceived social support on the levels of anxiety and depression of hemodialysis patients . the multidimensional scale of perceived social support mspss which has been translated and culturally adapted to the greek standards 11 12 was used to evaluate the perceived social support of hemodialysis patients . to test the existence of association between levels of anxiety depression and social support multinomial logistic regression was performed to estimate the effect of social support on the levels of anxiety depression dependent variable adjusted for potential confounders . descriptive statistics for social support and levels of anxiety depression of patients undergoing hemodialysis n258 table 3 presents the results of the association between social support and levels of anxiety depression . there was a statistically significant association between anxiety depression and social support from significant others family and friends p0001 for all associations . in particular patients with high levels of anxiety and depression felt less support from their significant others family and friends . association between social support and levels of anxiety depression of patients undergoing hemodialysis n258 . lastly multinomial logistic regression was performed to assess the effect of social support on the levels of anxiety and depression adjusted to various potential confounding factors affecting anxiety and depression . after adjusting for confounders effect of social support on the levels of anxiety depression of hemodialysis patients n258 . furthermore we conclude that after adjusting for confounding factors statistically significant effect of social support from friends we had on anxiety levels p0004 and more specifically an one point increase in the support from friends reduces by 57 the chances that patients will have high levels of anxiety in relation to not having at all anxiety . from table 2 we conclude that patients felt highly supported from their significant others and their family median 6 for both subscales and less from their friends median 4.5 neutral support levels . descriptive statistics for social support and levels of anxiety depression of patients undergoing hemodialysis n258 table 3 presents the results of the association between social support and levels of anxiety depression . there was a statistically significant association between anxiety depression and social support from significant others family and friends p0001 for all associations . in particular patients with high levels of anxiety and depression felt less support from their significant others family and friends . association between social support and levels of anxiety depression of patients undergoing hemodialysis n258 . lastly multinomial logistic regression was performed to assess the effect of social support on the levels of anxiety and depression adjusted to various potential confounding factors affecting anxiety and depression . after adjusting for confounders effect of social support on the levels of anxiety depression of hemodialysis patients n258 . furthermore we conclude that after adjusting for confounding factors statistically significant effect of social support from friends we had on anxiety levels p0004 and more specifically an one point increase in the support from friends reduces by 57 the chances that patients will have high levels of anxiety in relation to not having at all anxiety . the results also revealed that patients with high levels of anxiety and depression felt less support from their significant others family and friends . 26 illustrated that persistently high anxiety and depression are associated with reduced perceived social support . 27 demonstrated that depressive symptoms were associated with lack of perceived social support .", " chest x ray revealed massively dilated esophagus along the right cardiac border figure 1 . ct of the chest showed esophageal body dilatation filled with food remaining that compressed the left atrium figure 2 . antero posterior chest x ray that shows poorly defined borders at the median and lower right lobe and

suitable organ as well as to gather sufficient pre clinical data . previously the standard method for preoperative angiographic evaluation of the donor vascular system was conventional angiography whose disadvantages include being invasive and time consuming as well as the fact that it requires the use of ionizing radiation and large amounts of contrast agents . the goal of this study was to confirm the feasibility of using mdcta to evaluate the vascular system of micropigs and establish standard reference values for the vascular diameter and anatomy which would be useful for selection of suitable donor organs in the future . the diameter of the main arteries was assessed from the most appropriate point of the segment 11.5 cm from the ostium using the workstation electronic cursor . in addition both a morphological evaluation and measurement of the diameter of the svc and inferior vena cava ivc were also performed . the diameter of the main arteries was assessed from the most appropriate point of the segment 11.5 cm from the ostium using the workstation electronic cursor . in the present study we measured the diameters of the major systemic vessels and compared those data to previously published human data table 1 . the mean diameters of the micropig ascending and descending thoracic aorta aortic arch and svc were 1.69 0.12 cm 1.23 0.11 cm 1.50 0.07 cm and 1.93 0.33 cm respectively . the mean diameters of these vessels were 0.85 0.06 cm 0.52 0.08 cm 0.68 0.05 cm 0.38 0.05 cm and 1.65 0.201.59 there were no anatomical variations in the micropigs in relation to humans however the diameter of the abdominal aorta was significantly smaller than in humans fig . in all six micropigs examined the external and internal iliac arteries arose directly from the aorta . accurate preoperative imaging of donor vasculature is of great importance because vascular variations such as accessory arteries and early branching are particularly important when determining optimal organ extraction procedures and the type of anastomosis . furthermore imaging evaluation of vascular systems using mdcta plays a critical role in solid organ transplantation to facilitate the selection of suitable donors planning the surgical procedure and revealing any co existing pathology . in this study we performed anatomical evaluations and diameter measurements of the major systemic vessels in micropigs using 64channel mdcta . in addition the morphology of the major micropig vessels did not reveal significant differences when compared to those of humans except for in the case of the iliac artery . in all micropigs evaluated the external and internal iliac arteries arose directly from the aorta . in addition the smaller diameter of micropig arteries compared to human vessels may be problematic in terms of perioperative complications . for example hepatic arteries with diameters less than 3 mm are considered to present a high surgical risk for liver transplantation thus accurate preoperative evaluation of the arterial diameter is essential for successful organ transplantation . in addition mdcta has been reported to be as accurate as renal angiography for evaluating the arterial anatomy and more sensitive for detecting venous and parenchymal structures . therefore mdcta is a suitable method to evaluate the anatomy of vascular structures of potential xenotransplantation donors as well as human recipients . we have determined that 64channel mdcta allows accurate evaluation of the major systemic vasculature in micropigs .", " add the appropriate pre

for improving appropriateness in test request and result interpretation 8 and finally d the risks for patient safety related to previous issues 9 . as recently highlighted by tate and coll clinical laboratory testing is now a global activity and laboratories no longer work in isolation therefore there is an increasing awareness of the importance and urgency to achieve harmonization in all steps of the total testing process ttp for ensuring comparability and interchangeability of laboratory information . the importance to standardize patient preparation and sample collection requirements to minimize the uncertainty from the pre analytical phase has already activated efforts to provide better evidence and recommendations . although the terms standardization and harmonization define two distinct albeit closely linked concepts in laboratory medicine the final goal is the same the equivalence of measurement results among different routine measurement procedures over time and space according to defined analytical and clinical quality specifications 22 . over the past two decades several clinical laboratory tests have been standardized through the development of reference measurement procedures the ifcc playing a major role in this project . a major lesson we learnt is that standardization and harmonization should not be applied only to clinical chemistry measurands but to the whole field of laboratory medicine including molecular diagnostics 31 . therefore the debate on harmonization should not be limited to clinical chemistry scientists but should involve all

whether exendin4 a glp1 receptor agonist exerts cytoprotective effects in pancreatic cells under lipotoxic condition had not been determined completely . therefore the aim of the present study was to investigate the potential antiapoptotic and prosurvival actions of exendin4 in pancreatic cells under a chronic lipotoxic condition and the underlying signaling pathways involved . min6 cells were cultured in a high glucose 25 mm serum free dmem with 0.5 bsa or 0.4 mm palmitate added 0.5 bsa with or without erk12 inhibitor in the presence or absence of exendin4 . to determine the effects of exendin4 on cell survival and proliferation min6 cells were incubated in the 0.5 bsa bsa and 0.4 mm palmitate added 0.5 bsa pa with or without increasing concentrations of exendin4 1500 nm ex for 24 h. cell viability and proliferation were assessed by the mtt assay and an elisa based brdu incorporation kit respectively . exendin4 treatment reversed palmitate induced reduction of cell viability and 100 nm exendin4 displayed a major effect of restoring the cell viability by 27 p 0.01 versus pa . exendin4 treatment alone showed a nonsignificant promotion to cell survival and 100 nm exendin4 provided the best potentiation 112 p 0.21 versus bsa . exendin4 treatment alone displayed a nonsignificant increase in cell proliferation and 100 nm exendin4 provided the greatest tendency 120 p 0.11 versus bsa . 100 nm exendin4 treatment with pa presence resulted in a significant decrease of apoptosis 87 p 0.01 pa ex versus pa . we investigated the effect of exendin4 on erk12 phosphorylation under palmitate treatment by detecting the ratio of phosphorylated erk12 expression to total erk12 expression figure 2a . we also determined the role of the erk12 inhibitor on the cytoprotective effect of exendin4 by mtt assay and hoechst33258 assay figures 2d and 2e . consistent with the aforementioned results exendin4 treatment promoted cell survival 95.3 3.7 versus 68.4 6.9 p 0.01 ex pa versus pa and prevented apoptosis of min6 cells 21.2 2.1 versus 33.5 3.7 p 0.01 ex pa versus pa under lipotoxic condition whereas pd98059 suppressed this promotion of cell survival 71.0 4.6 versus 95.3 3.7 p 0.05 ex pd pa versus ex pa and attenuated the restore of apoptosis 29.2 3.2 versus 21.2 2.1 p 0.05 ex pd pa versus ex pa under lipotoxic condition . all these results strongly suggested that exendin4 protected min6 cells against lipotoxicity at least in part via activation of erk12 signaling pathway . moreover whether exendin4 protects cells against lipotoxicity remains to be determined . in the present study we found that exendin4 inhibited palmitate induced apoptosis via activating erk12 pathway and also through inhibiting mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in the min6 cells . in this study we demonstrated that treatment with exendin4 a glp1 agonist protected pancreatic cell from palmitate induced toxicity by enhancing proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis in a dose dependent manner figure 1 . further treatment with the erk12 inhibitor pd98059 blocked this protective effect of exendin4 figure 2 . these data indicate that exendin4 exerted cytoprotective effect on pancreatic cells against lipotoxicity at least in part via the erk12 pathway . in our study we found both erk12 activation and enhanced bcl2 expression induced by exendin4 treatment under lipotoxic condition . in conclusion it is likely that exendin4 induced erk12 activation is an important pathway by which exendin4 exerts antiapoptotic actions against palmitate induced lipotoxicity . besides the potential cytoprotective effect of exendin4 on cells involves the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway by upregulating bcl2 . because lipotoxicity is supposed to be responsible for cell loss in the pathological process of obesity associated type 2 diabetes the antilipotoxic effects on residual cells of exendin4 may arouse interest considering its therapeutic utilization in type 2 diabetes treatment .", " this drawing is shown to highlight the fact that an mrna assay read out represents the outcome of a long series of steps each of which potentially contributing to the overall variability of the quantification operation . one of the common goals of mrna quantification is to correlate a change in a subset of mrnas with a change in biological phenotype . figure 1 shows the events between the original specimen to be investigated and the rna assay readout thus illuminating possible sources of technical variability . whether the precisions and accuracies of the measurements of a transcript by means of 2 different probes are close enough to make inter microarray data analyses relevant is still a matter of legitimate debate.11 it is common practice in the literature to refer to observed microarray measurements as gene expression levels . 2 reasonable questions to ask are whether the various labeling steps alter the original distribution of the mrnas samples and if they do to what extent does this occur in order to address these questions an experiment could be designed utilizing a large quantity of rna from distinct contrasted biological systems . the various labeled nucleic acids would then be assayed in replicates to the same type of microarray such that the only source of variability is the actual rna labeling procedure everything else remaining constant . the scope of the experiment was to assess to what extent the liver cells activity as measured by the level of protein coding rna is changing with regards to the perturbation . inferring a bonafide relationship between changes in the level of a given mrna molecule level with the change in the biological response under study requires providing evidence that the observed variation is explained mainly by the biological factor and not by a confounding event . this report shows that where the assay was performed ie in which laboratory andor which method of rna labeling was used represent unexpected co factors that actually mask the source of biological variability . stated differently the series of procedures starting from the extraction of rna out of the biosample up to the microarray readout is not without disturbing the original distribution of rna occurring in the biological sample . the amount of light intensity unit of measurement in the microarray were converted to a value of relative abundance of a mrna molecule through the data reduction procedure reported by izarrzi et al.17 data processing and analyses were performed with affymetrix genechip

correlates with the biological condition the data for each set was processed according to the same series of transformations depicted in the figure 3 i extraction of numerical values from the raw image tiff file with the affymetrix genechip command console software16 ii normalization according to the quantile normalization and iii summarization of individual probes values into a single mrna level value as described by irizarri et al.17 this quantile normalization assumes that the overall quantity of mrna across the whole range of binned values has to be consistent across similar biological systems . the outcome of these data transformation is a data matrix with the 3 conditions each represented by 5 replicates and 40000 observations ie the affymetrix probe sets representative of their cognate mrna . figure 4 shows a series of diagnostic plots commonly used to evaluate the molecular integrity of the mrna quantified in the assay . there were 3 feeding conditions with 5 each laboratory has initiated the quantification with the same source of rna . as shown in the figure 2b the rna samples branched out to different experimental paths from the step following the rna extraction and prior to the rna labeling procedure . if we conceptually group all the finite experimental steps that span from the end of the rna extraction up to the image acquisition step into a single experimental event the data set in hands was associated with 2 factors the biological factor ie the feeding conditions and the technical factor ie the rna labeling procedure . in addition based on prior knowledge of the regulation of gene expression it is reasonable to state that the mrna level data matrix is not made of 40000 independent events and that instead there is a fair amount of redundancy . the principle components analysis pca plots in figure 4 suggest that the rna content of the liver for these 3 groups of animals was also different and the data itself which is the output of a series of molecular transformations has kept that difference . altogether these initial explorations allowed for the conclusion that the rna molecules quantified in this study were not degraded and were suitable for subsequent correlation studies . therefore it looked as if one could confidently infer which mrna molecules exhibited a change correlating with the perturbation brought in by the different feeding conditions . the data points clustered with regards to the laboratory where the rna has been processed . these differences in the rna labeling how subtle they might seem obviously did modify the final nucleic acids composition mix applied to the microarray . while the plots of the figure 4 show that the 5 data sets contained biologically meaningful informational contents the plots in figures 5 and 6 and results in table 1 indicate that any post rna extraction manipulations potentially modify the original rna composition . when each laboratory data set is considered

microarray quality control maqc advised the research community that overall data sets collected from various platforms perform relatively in concordance to each other.10 2 comments might be added to the current recommendations of the maqc group i no study was performed with respect to the other component of the high throughput rna measurement ie the preparation of the labeled rna ii despite some overlap between the results return from the same biological sample from 2 distinct assay platforms there remains a large fraction of observations that are due to the idiosyncrasy of the measurement . the overlap between the 5 data sets shown in the table 1 are likely to be the genuinely differential mrna levels correlating with the environmental challenge submitted to the biological system . the fact that no other significant gene ontology classes were retrieved suggests that the remaining subset of different mrna levels recorded in the data sets are stochastic events caused by the various methods applied to label the rna . the latest update on that matter released by the fda study group called the microarray quality control maqc advised the research community that overall data sets collected from various platforms perform relatively in concordance to each other.10 2 comments might be added to the current recommendations of the maqc group i no study was performed with respect to the other component of the high throughput rna measurement ie the preparation of the labeled rna ii despite some overlap between the results return from the same biological sample from 2 distinct assay platforms there remains a large fraction of observations that are due to the idiosyncrasy of the measurement . the overlap between the 5 data sets shown in the table 1 are likely to be the genuinely differential mrna levels correlating with the environmental challenge submitted to the biological system . the fact that no other significant gene ontology classes were retrieved suggests that the remaining subset of different mrna levels recorded in the data sets are stochastic events caused by the various methods applied to label the rna .", " this study was conducted to investigate the following hypotheses and questions 1 does cold gel pack reduce the pain associated with deep breathing and coughing db and c after cardiac surgery 2 what sensations do patients have during the application of cold gel packs over sternal incision dressing 3 do patients undergoing open heart surgery prefer cold therapy prior to db and c this study was a randomized controlled trial rct with crossover design which was conducted in the cardiac surgery intensive care unit icu at a university affiliated hospital in urmia iran . data were gathered between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. in order to reduce variablity among patients cold therapy was applied on the first post surgical day when they were oriented to place and time and able to report pain . all patients performed four episodes of dbandc two with cold gel pack and two without it every 2 h. the seqence of gel pack application was randomized so that half of the patients were given gel pack for 15 min followed by a period of no treatment so called washout period and then they were not given gel pack . the following open ended questions were asked every 5 min during each session of using cold gel pack to assess patients perception of cold therapy how does the gel pack feel on your chest can you describe the sensation to me to assess their preferences about cold therapy the following questions were asked at the end of the fourth session do you prefer cold therapy prior to dbandc data collection instruments used in this research were as follows a patient profile form that had been specifically designed for the study was completed by the patients . during the fifteen minutes15 min of gel pack application the patients were asked to describe the sensation he shethey felt during gel pack application . there were 50 patients 35 males and 15 females recruited for this study from post cardiac surgery icu and no side effects or complications due to the cold therapy via gel pack were reported . average pain scores between the group that started with the gel pack mean m 4.56 standard deviation sd 1.64 and the group that started without the gel pack m 5.36 sd 1.7 were not significantly different t 1.7 df 48 p 0.1 . the interaction between intervention and time was significant p 0.001 table 2 and indicated that the pain scores after db and c were significantly lower when patients used the gel pack . means and standard deviations of pain intensity scores pre and post db and c interactions between intervention session and time found with rm anova at the first time of applying cold gel pack 48 96 patients reported feeling coolness and 2 4 patients felt numbness and at the second time of applying cold gel pack 37 74 patients reported feeling coolness and 4 8 patients felt cold 9 18 experienced numbness and no one experienced tingling . in this study pain scores after dbandc were lower with gel pack compared to without gel pack in all four sessions . in a similar study in which participants underwent four episodes of dbandc two with the gel pack and two without it similar results were obtained with cold therapy in various conditions such as chest tube removal soft tissue injuries hernia and orthopedic injuries . patients in this study reported their pain as moderate m 3.8110 when using the gel pack as compared to severe pain m 6.1810 reported without the gel pack . application of cold gel packs resulted in decreased skin temperature and the feeling of coolness cold and numbess in patients . cooling the sternum by the cold gel packs seems to be an appealing method for pain management and is perceived as being effective for pain reduction . application of cold gel pack was effective for reducing incisional pain associated with db and c in cardiac surgery patients .", " symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia tn is caused by a demonstrable structural lesion other than vascular compression typically posterior fossa tumors or multiple sclerosis 1 2 . this pain may be either persistent or intermittent sometimes occurring in brief attacks that may reproduce tn features . there was no evidence of a vascular contact at the root entry zone of the right trigeminal nerve.fig . at this moment we found the same neurologic signs he presented at onset though milder including some sensory impairment on the right side of his face . two days after leaving the icu our patient started having brief electric shock like pains in the whole distribution of the first division v1 of the right trigeminal nerve . he had experienced sudden hemifacial numbness 1 year before and mri demonstrated an old ischemic lesion at the root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve . reported a female patient who suddenly developed a neuralgic pain in her left chin and cheek . mri showed an acute pontine infarction just at the root entry zone of the right trigeminal nerve . therefore wallenberg syndrome is a typical cause of central post stroke pain and this pain may occasionally take the attributes of a symptomatic tn . facial pain was always ipsilateral to the infarction and was mostly localized in the periorbital region . these patients reported short pain attacks lasting seconds to minutes and three of them also had persistent pain . although a diagnosis of tn was not made the shortest pain attacks i.e . our patient also had neuralgiform pain attacks in association with a wallenberg s syndrome . the painful paroxysms were brief and intense fulfilling ichd ii diagnostic criteria for symptomatic tn . in conclusion ischemic lesions covering the trigeminal spinal tract and nucleus at the lower levels of the medulla seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of the pain .", " primary hyperparathyroidism phpt is a disease characterized by hypercalcemia due to autonomous production of parathyroid hormone pth . phpt is the third most common endocrine disorder in the west after diabetes mellitus and thyroid disorders . with the advent of multichannel biochemical screening in the 1970s the clinical profiles of phpt remarkably differ with regions of the world . in developing countries such as india phpt is still uncommonly diagnosed overtly symptomatic disease with skeletal muscular and renal manifestations . in this study we describe the clinical characteristics biochemical profile and outcome of 78 patients with phpt seen over a period of two decades at a single center from the kashmir valley . all patients who underwent evaluation and surgery for phpt from january 1996 to december 2015 at sher i kashmir institute of medical sciences were included in the study . a total of 78 patients were identified during the two decades of whom 29 patients were studied retrospectively 19962012 and remaining 49 patients were studied prospectively 20122015 . the diagnosis of phpt was based on the following i persistent elevation of serum calcium above the upper limit of normal range 10.5 mg dl ii increased intact pth ipth and iii histological evidence after parathyroid surgery of parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia . evaluation of the patients included the measurement of serum total calcium inorganic phosphorus total alkaline phosphatase alp ipth 25hydroxy vitamin d 25ohd serum albumin and 24 hour urinary calcium and creatinine . about one fourth 19 24.38 of our patients had both renal and skeletal manifestations . the surgical success cure for phpt is defined by the maintenance of eucalcemia at the arbitrarily accepted interval of 6 months after surgery . one of these patients had men1 phpt and acromegaly she underwent the removal of all four parathyroid glands . the surgical success cure for phpt is defined by the maintenance of eucalcemia at the arbitrarily accepted interval of 6 months after surgery . one of these patients had men1 phpt and acromegaly she underwent the removal of all four parathyroid glands . a systematic review of phpt in india has reported fractures in 40 and brown tumors in 42 patients . a recent indian study reported fractures in 25.8 of phpt patients and brown tumors in none . our results reflect a changing trend in the presentation of phpt in india wherein the overt skeletal disease in the form of fractures and brown tumors is on the decline . the remarkably low prevalence of fractures in our series probably is due to earlier diagnosis of phpt for last few years more than half of our subjects were enrolled from 2013 onwards . the frequency of specific radiological manifestations of phpt in the united states declined from 23 in the 1960s to a remarkably low 2 in the 1990s . a previous indian study has reported hypophosphatemia in 65 patients with phpt but another indian study has reported a normal mean serum phosphorus in phpt patients . the mean serum ipth level in our patients was 377.6 pg ml which is lower than that reported by previous indian studies . elevated alp has been consistently reported by other indian series due to high prevalence of bone disease in phpt patients . we found a strong correlation of parathyroid gland weight with serum calcium and ipth as has been reported previously . in addition vitamin d may not be the only significant factor in the development of bone disease in phpt patients other factors could be playing a significant role . consistent with the data about recurrent phpt on long term follow up revealing recurrence rates of zero to 41.6 none of the 41 patients in our series on whom follow up was available for 19 years had recurrence of phpt . in conclusion our study reflects a changing trend in the clinical profile of phpt in india .", " increasing evidence suggest that oxidative stress is a key contributor to the pathogenesis of pd which causes damage to nucleic acids both dna and rna proteins lipids and other cellular macromolecules whose functions are indispensable for cell survival . the most frequent dna lesion generated by oxidative stress is 8oxo78dihydroguanine 8oxodg the oxidized form of guanine often associated with neurodegenerative diseases including pd and alzheimer s disease ad . 8oxodg has also been implicated in an event called transcriptional mutagenesis tm whereby a misincorporated adenine in the transcribing mrna leads to the generation of mutated species of protein figure 1 . it is well documented that oxidative dna damage accumulates in ageing brains and this accumulation is significantly increased in brains of patients with pd and ad compared to their age matched controls . these increased levels of dna damage are also corroborated by decrease in the dna repair capacity of specific enzymes such as 8oxodg dna glycosylase1 ogg1 . moreover compared with replicating cells neurons that are post mitotic cells might be even more vulnerable to 8oxodg mediated tm as pathogenic effects caused by mutant species generated through tm events could be accumulated over a lifetime . in the following review we discuss the importance of oxidative damage in pd and its scope in the pathogenesis of the disease through 8oxodg mediated tm events . oxidation of proteins can disrupt the active site of enzymes lead to conformational change disrupt protein protein interactions and alter their binding capacity to dna eventually threatening cell survival . in addition increased levels of oxidative damage to dna and rna bases have been consistent with the neurodegenerative conditions like pd ad and als . the origin of oxidative stress and subsequent accumulation of damage can not only be attributed to the overproduction of ros but also to the inefficient cellular defense and repair machinery against oxidative stress . as discussed previously accumulation of ros induced dna damage like oxidation of bases and single strand breaks have been implicated in the etiology of ad pd als and other neurological disorders . neuronal dysfunctions have been linked to mutations or differential expression of base excision repair enzymes like ogg1 xrcc1 single strand break repair enzymes like tdp1 aprataxin and double strand break repair enzymes like atm and nbs1 . together these evidences strongly suggest that oxidative stress mediated damage to cellular macromolecules including dna coupled with inefficient repair leads to progressive neurodegeneration as seen in ad pd als and others . the high metabolic activity of neurons along with their long life span makes them highly susceptible to oxidative damage . although the exact causes for this selective vulnerability is yet to be elucidated da metabolism itself has been considered as a major culprit for selective degeneration . under conditions of pd nigral neurons appear to be in an exaggerated oxidative stress causing severe damage to cellular macromolecules . dna damage by oxidative stress can result in the production of either nonbulky dna lesions like 8oxodg that can be repaired by the base excision repair pathway or bulky dna lesions which are generally repaired by the nucleotide excision repair pathway . 8oxodg the most frequent dna lesion caused by oxidative stress is often associated with neurodegenerative diseases including pd . immunocytochemical analysis of 8oxodg revealed a significant increase of this dna oxidation marker in the substantia nigra of patients with pd although the extent of nuclear 8oxodg accumulation is not as high as mitochondrial 8oxodg . together it suggests that 8oxodg lesion is often bypassed by rna polymerase ii without efficient detection by the transcription coupled repair or the base excision repair machinery generating transcription mutant species and contributing to the pathogenesis of various diseases including cancer neurodegeneration or cardiovascular disease . 8oxodg derived tm species may trigger this process leading to the pathogenesis of pd . together we propose a hypothetical model by which 8oxodg lesions in the protein coding region of snca could yield a small amount of tm protein species with higher aggregation propensity that potentially serve as a seeding for accelerating the aggregation of wild type syn leading to the self propagation of aggregates and causing degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway in pd figure 5 . comprehensive investigation on age dependent changes in syn mrna profiles as well as identification of tm species supported by functional studies on mutant proteins will definitely add a new dimension to the understanding of syn pathology in conjunction with oxidative stress .", " a recent study on balance and pilates demonstrated that pilates can be effective for enhancing both static and dynamic equilibrium capacity in university students in a 16week mat exercise course13 . in another study by changgiun14 based on these findings we hypothesized that pilates exercise training could be an effective post stroke rehabilitation method to address impairments frequently encountered by patients with stroke such as flexibility somatosensory loss muscular strength and balance15161718 . currently most of the studies on pilates training programs have focused on orthopedic remedial exercise192021 or balance improvement in the elderly16 21 22 . reported that a 5week pilates training course for the elderly contributed to greater benefits in static and dynamic balance compared to usual activity16 . therefore the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of an 8week mat based pilates exercise training program on the static and dynamic balance abilities of patients with chronic stroke . to verify the effects of the 8week pilates training course on the static and dynamic balance of patients with chronic stroke two data collection protocols were conducted one week before and after the training . we examined the effects of pilates exercise training on static and dynamic balance in patients with chronic stroke . to our knowledge this investigation is the first to show improvements in static and dynamic balance following pilates training in this population . an 8week pilates training course contributed to a 40 improvement in a p cop sway in the elderly28 . reported that a 5week pilates training course led to a 1622 improvement in m l cop sway p0.001 during challenging balance tasks16 . given that cop variables in the m l direction are closely related to the risk of falls32 33 the improvement of cop variables in this direction increases the expectation that pilates training may have an influence on the reduction of fall risk in patients with chronic stroke . to our knowledge this is the first study using pilates training as an intervention to improve static and dynamic balance in patients with chronic stroke . despite the documented effects on balance pilates training has not yet been applied to the rehabilitation of patients with chronic stroke . however as a result of this study the 8week pilates training program has been proven fully effective for the treatment of static and dynamic balance in patients with chronic stroke . as pilates training for patients with chronic stroke has not been reported this study could only be compared to studies of pilates training for the elderly . gait parameters or emg activity that may be used to assess static and dynamic balance improvements after pilates training . therefore follow up studies should be performed to investigate the impact of pilates training on gait parameters or lower limb emg activity related to balance measures . this study proved that an 8week pilates training program improved the static and dynamic balance of patients with chronic stroke . therefore if these training parameters are used in the clinic when it becomes appropriate for the patient a pilates program can be an effective treatment for the recovery of walking ability which is the highest objective of rehabilitation for patients with chronic stroke . given these results pilates training should be considered as a rehabilitation intervention for balance improvement in patients with chronic stroke .", " there are several approaches for heterotopic cervical pregnancy management and generally the purpose of conservative management is fertility preservation surgical treatments including uterine artery ligation and embolization foley catheter insertion and cervical curettage with or without cerclage while medical treatments include transvaginal potassium chloride kcl or methotrexate mtx injection . reported the first live birth of a heterotopic cervical pregnancy which was managed with transvaginal ultrasound guided selective reduction with kcl . we present the case of a rare event of a heterotopic pregnancy in which it was possible to maintain the intrauterine pregnancy iup to term without complications and reviewed the literature to suggest the best treatment for a successful pregnancy outcome . heterotopic cervical pregnancy is extremely rare and most cases are associated with assisted reproductive technology . early diagnosis of heterotopic cervical pregnancy can provide the opportunity for successful conservative management . therefore we reviewed the literature to identify the best treatment of heterotopic cervical pregnancy for a successful pregnancy outcome . only four cases of heterotopic cervical pregnancy had been conceived spontaneously and naturally 4 7 the other patients had received infertility treatment . although a general treatment strategy can not be suggested because of the small number of cases complete removal of the cervical conception should be considered for a successful pregnancy outcome .", " despite the increased prevalence of weight concern and weight control practices among teenagers obesity has been increasing steadily 1 2 . healthy or overweight individuals who perceive themselves as overweight or fat are more likely to engage in weight reduction activities whereas individuals with an excess body weight who do not perceive themselves overweight will not involve themselves in weight loss behaviours 11 12 . evidence supports that there is a decline in physical activity levels and consumption of fruits and vegetables and breakfast during adolescence among teenagers who perceive themselves as overweight . body weight perception is influenced by a number of factors including age gender family peers media and ethnicity 16 17 . females are more inclined to perceive themselves as overweight and engage in undue weight loss practices 12 20 . teenagers adopt behaviours and attitudes that prevail among their peers and pressure to be thin has a negative impact on body weight perception . given the implications of body weight perception on weight control behaviours this issue needs to be examined among local teenagers . the aim of the study is to investigate body weight perception among male and female teenagers aged between 13 to 18 years of age using the conceptual framework adapted from wang et al . the objectives of the study are to investigate the relationship of actual body weight status and body weight perception among teenagers and to document the impact of body weight perception and weight control practices among teenagers . based on body mass index bmi table 1 16.6 was underweight 10.0 in boys versus 23.3 in girls 11.7 were overweight 16.7 in boys versus 4.4 in girls and the rest of the participants 71.7 were of normal weight 73.3 in boys versus 70.0 in girls . body weight overestimation was reported by 61.1 of the girls and 14.4 of boys . among participants with a normal or underweight bmi normal weight and underweight girls had a more inaccurate self evaluation of their current weight status with 58.3 of them finding themselves to be overweight compared to 10.7 of normal weight and underweight boys . more than twice as many girls participants 61.1 were involved in weight loss practices compared to boys 25.6 . the purpose of the study was to investigate body weight perception and weight control practices among teenagers and the outcome of the study supports the general trend that exists . consistent with other studies the outcome of this survey indicated that body weight exaggeration was more prevalent in girls than boys . among the students who were involved in weight control the prevalence of weight loss practices was higher among girls 61.1 girls versus 25.6 boys . a large proportion 88.5 of teenagers engaged in weight reduction activities perceived themselves as overweight even though only 19.2 of them actually have a bmi above the 85th percentile on the growth chart . documented that those adolescents who reported trying to lose weight did not have higher physical activity level or fruit and vegetable intake than others . the majority of weight loss teens 95.8 expressed some body dissatisfaction in that they perceived themselves overweight and this could partly explain their poor engagement in physical activity . in light of the high prevalence of body weight misperception existing among the teenagers and the fact that body weight perception motivated weight control behaviours promotion of healthy body image perception and healthy eating by schools and health organisations is important .", " in addition to using the bmi despite its limitations large scale research must rely heavily on self reported obesity estimates due to economic and logistical constraints even though these estimates are distorted by reporting bias and error 7 8 . as a result of the bias and error self reported values underestimate the prevalence of obesity and consequently overestimate associations between excess body fat and chronic diseases 79 . as direct bmi measurements which are the gold standard for bmi data are an expensive method of data collection researchers have recently developed and recommended the use of correction equations based on measured data to correct self reported values 7 1015 . therefore although connor gorber and colleagues 7 15 generated correction equations in 2008 for canadians in general and reassessed them in 2011 given that they are population specific they may not hold in atypical regions of canada such as atlantic canada which has unique sociodemographic characteristics and the highest obesity rates in the country . this study involved a secondary data analysis of a large national representative survey specifically the canadian community health survey cchs 2007 2008 to answer the following main research question how well do the national correction equations correct self reported estimates of obesity in atlantic canada and is there a significant difference between atlantic canadian and national correction equations in yielding corrected obesity estimates that are closer to measured data as compared to self reported values the study was approved by the interdisciplinary committee on ethics in human research at memorial university . the correction model namely bmimeasured b0 b1bmiself reported error employed in this study was equivalent to that of connor gorber and colleagues model 4 . table 2 displays information on the direction and magnitude of bias and error in self reported bmi for both sexes in atlantic canada . mean bmi values based on self reported height and weight data were significantly lower p .0001 than those based on measurements for both sexes . for both equations among men who were underweight or normal weight both self reported and corrected bmi means were not significantly different than their measured counterpart . with respect to overweight or obese men and women the corrected bmi means were more accurate i.e. while recognizing their deficiencies researchers use self reported bmi data out of necessity in large surveys such as the cchs in canada and the national health interview survey in the united states . initial attempts to correct bmi values based on self report led plankey et al . to publicize in 1997 that prediction equations do not eliminate systematic error in self reported bmi data . although corrected estimates are not usually identical to direct measurements in recent years bmi correction equations have been more successful at bridging the gap between self reported numbers and measurements 7 915 . since the dawn of correction equations reporting bias and error have doubled in canada which improves the odds of having corrected bmi values that are significantly closer to physical measurements than their corresponding self reported figures 7 16 . in addition as observed in this and another canadian study while the equations bring self reported overweight and obesity estimates closer to measured values which is important in this line of research 7 8 23 it should be noted that this process skews the underweight and normal weight data . both correction equations significantly improved the accuracy of self reported atlantic canadian obesity data . the success of the correction equations used herein also corroborates current assertions by international researchers 7 1015 that these equations provide better obesity estimates than those based on self report . canadian regional statistics on levels of obesity are normally derived from self report questionnaires on account of sample size limitations for measured data . the application of the national correction equations should strengthen research conducted with self reported atlantic canadian obesity data . although a sampling weight created by statistics canada was used to adjust for differential participation rates if the characteristics of non respondents such as mean bmi were significantly different than respondents then non response bias may have tainted the study . also the results of this study add to a small but accumulating body of research supporting the efficacy of bmi correction equations . in light of reports that self reported bmi statistics underestimate the prevalence of obesity and overestimate associations between obesity and chronic diseases 7 8 23 we strongly recommend the use of correction equations to other researchers analysing obesity data collected by self report . in particular given the nature of bmi correction equations we recommend that canadian researchers use the national correction equations in the absence of measured data or compute their own correction equations if they have measured and self reported obesity data .", " damage to these structures including the communication tracts from hemorrhages infarctions and tumors can result in memory disturbances.12 in addition to these structures valenstein et al . we report on a patient who developed both verbal and visual memory deficits after an acute infarction of the retrosplenial cortex . we considered that the amnesia of our patient was due to the retrosplenial lesion because memory related structures other than the retrosplenium were intact . although the mild perfusion delay to the left pca territory might have contributed to his amnesia there were no significant changes in the relative cerebral blood volume and cerebral blood flow compared with the corresponding contralateral regions fig . however we could not exclude the possibility of other small infarctions being present in the areas related to the memory function because we did observe point lesions in the left central thalamus and left pca territory . in contrast there are reported cases of a single right retrosplenial lesion causing both visual and verbal memory deficits.5 there is strong evidence that the right medial temporal lobe is involved in navigation and it now appears that input of the hippocampus and related structures receive from and convey to the right retrosplenial cortex has a similar spatial preference while the left medial temporal and left retrosplenial cortices appear primarily concerned with more general aspects of episodic memory.346 however there are recent studies that can explain the presence of both visual and verbal amnesias in our case . although bilateral retrosplenial lesions tend to have a poor prognosis retrosplenial amnesia generally recovers rapidly.48 each retrosplenium receives major inputs from the contralateral retrosplenium the orbital and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex the anterior cingulate cortex parahippocampal cortex superior temporal sulcus precuneus claustrum and the anterior and lateral thalamic nuclei.9 therefore a good prognosis may be partly due to functional substitution of the counterpart retrosplenium or other parts of the cerebrum . however in the case of yasuda et al.5 which showed a poor prognosis the lesion encroached the retrosplenium more posteriorly although the size and location of the cerebral infarction were similar to those in our case .", " the asthma quality of life questionnaire aqlq is a disease specific instrument that was developed in 1992 specifically for use in clinical studies . the aqlq comprises domains assessing multiple aspects of the daily life of asthma patients and assesses their physical and emotional status thus allowing assessment of the subjective experience of asthma . questionnaires have been developed in order to assess the level of asthma control and studies have assessed the correlation between asthma control and qol . given the importance of this issue the objective of the present study was to identify and characterize factors associated with qol in patients with severe asthma treated at a referral center in the city of salvador as well as to determine the association of qol related factors with aqlq scores overall and individual domain scores . this was a cross sectional study to assess the qol of patients with severe asthma . the level of asthma control was assessed with the acq which was administered at the same time point as was the aqlq . the following data were collected from the aforementioned database sociodemographic data gender age level of education race and occupation clinical data history of smoking history of pulmonary tuberculosis presence of other respiratory diseases diagnosis of refractory asthma bmi presence of comorbidities percent predicted fev1 and acq scores clinical data on pharmacotherapy starting dose of ics types of inhalers number of inhalers and number of drugs used and qol data aqlq scores . finally the factors associated with qol in the study sample were identified and characterized and their association with the overall aqlq score and individual aqlq domain scores was determined . there was a statistically significant difference between the level of asthma control mean acq scores and the overall aqlq score p 0.01 . asthma control acq scores was found to show statistically significant differences with aqlq emotional function and symptoms domain scores table 4 . the acq score is indirectly related to the pharmacological treatment of asthma because the latter is aimed at controlling the disease reducing airway remodeling and reducing mortality . therefore the association of those variables with qol was assessed with the aqlq . the level of asthma control as measured by the acq was found to be a protective factor for the overall aqlq score and for aqlq symptoms and emotional function domain scores . other studies have shown an association between well controlled asthma and better qol patients with well controlled asthma having higher overall aqlq scores . with regard to the goals established by the clinical protocols and treatment guidelines for asthma control improving the qol of patients with severe asthma is as important as choosing the appropriate pharmaceutical interventions and drug therapies given that qol reflects how patients perceive asthma management outcomes and how they live with the disease . obtiveram se as

effects of the other variables included in the table the results of this study indicate that pharmacists knowledge and attitudes are strongly associated with dawmp . one possibility is that pharmacists feel competent to undertake dawmp particularly in the case of minor infections . when the pharmacist knew the patient complacency this increased the probability of dawmp which is consistent with another study conducted in the same setting . medical prescribing is influenced by patients expectations and a similar pattern of behaviour could well arise in the dispensing process particularly in countries like spain where patients are more prone to use antibiotics even for treating minor complaints andor viral illnesses . another possible limitation is that the percentage of pharmacists who acknowledged dawmp might be underestimated . these interventions could emphasize i the high level of dawmp responsibility ii the importance of resistance and its association with antibiotic use in outpatients insufficient knowledge and indifference and iii pharmacist patient communication through health education complacency . these interventions could emphasize i the high

the most severe end of the spectrum morphea may progress for years resulting in significant atrophy joint contractures and functional cosmetic and psychologic disabilities . epidemiologic data suggest that morphea progresses to systemic sclerosis in 0.95.7 of patients.2 morphea shows a great variety in its clinical presentation and has been classified into circumscribed linear including scleroderma en coup de sabre generalized pansclerotic and mixed variant morphea.3 the therapeutic options include the use of topical or oral corticosteroids vitamin d analogs calcitriol tacrolimus psoralen and ultraviolet a puva photochemotherapy uva1 cyclosporin penicillamine antimalarial drugs and methotrexate mtx.48 although treatment algorithms for morphea subtypes have been suggested by fett and werth there are still no consistent recommendations for the treatment of morphea based on the disease characteristics.910 this study attempts to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of mtx in refractory generalized morphea . clinical characteristics of patients were recorded comprising the disease duration past treatments for morphea and extracutaneous manifestations of the disease while family history of autoimmune diseases was also indicated . treatment was ceased in cases of very good improvement lack of improvement progressive disease or not manageable adverse events based on the judgment of our clinical team . a physician s global assessment pga scale was also used to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment with mtx after 6 9 and 12 months of therapy based on the improvement of the above mentioned 3 criteria . treatment failure was defined as no improvement in any of the 3 criteria andor appearance of the disease activity function that is worsening of the sclerosis presence of lilac ring increase of lesion size and presence of new lesions within previous visit . clinical characteristics of patients were recorded comprising the disease duration past treatments

patients in this study had a mean disease duration of 27 months before the initiation of mtx treatment . after 12 months of therapy very good response was achieved in 6 patients 30 and good response in 10 patients 50 . during the follow up period no new skin lesions of generalized morphea appeared and no exacerbation of the disease was observed . it is a well accepted practice to use systemic medications to treat severe and disabling forms of morphea including lesions resistant to topical therapy either in a cosmetically significant site face scalp and transverse a joint or with deep subcutaneous involvement.15 mtx has been studied as a treatment option for both morphea and systemic sclerosis . in a cohort study kroft et al have demonstrated the efficacy of mtx for various sclerotic skin diseases ls eosinophilic fasciitis and pseudoscleroderma in adult patients.21 in another study improvement was observed in adult patients with severe morphea treated with pulsed intravenous corticosteroids plus mtx.22 van den hoogen et al have shown that mtx therapy in systemic sclerosis resulted in reduction of skin thickness and improvement in general well being.23 similar findings have been reported by pope et al.24 in addition a recent retrospective chart review of adult patients with morphea treated with mtx showed that younger age at treatment initiation was associated with higher rates of disease remission suggesting that early treatment should be preferred in morphea.25 the mechanism of action of mtx is not fully understood .", " healthy subjects had 1

good quality scans were included in the analysis . compared with glaucoma suspect and healthy subjects glaucoma patients had significantly lower iops p 0.001 and p 0.042 respectively and they had also thinner central corneas compared with the glaucoma suspect group p 0.040 . statistically significant differences were found between glaucoma patients and healthy subjects for all ocular parameters except for disc area . visual field mean deviation and psd were not significantly different between glaucoma suspects and healthy controls p 0.819 and p 0.870 respectively . however glaucoma suspects had on average thinner rnfl and smaller rim areas compared with healthy subjects p 0.05 for both . the wivd values were significantly lower in glaucoma eyes 46.2 followed by glaucoma suspect eyes 51.3

analyses were completed comparing healthy subjects and glaucoma patients and healthy subjects and glaucoma suspect patients using the mean of both eyes in the analysis . overall the auroc se for discriminating between healthy and glaucomatous participants was highest for wivd 0.87 0.05 followed by rnfl thickness 0.87 0.04 and cpvd 0.71 0.08 . the auroc for differentiating between healthy and glaucoma suspects was highest for wivd 0.70 0.11 followed by cpvd 0.62 0.10 and rnfl thickness 0.62 0.09 . in the current study we demonstrated that oct a vessel density measured in the rnfl the most superficial layer of the retina distinguishes among groups of glaucoma glaucoma suspect and healthy participants . specifically wivd performs as well as rnfl thickness for discriminating between healthy and glaucoma patients and for differentiating between the healthy and glaucoma suspect groups . in the present study the diagnostic accuracy of vessel density measurements were evaluated for differentiating glaucoma eyes from healthy eyes as well as glaucoma patients from healthy subjects . regardless of whether the analysis was completed with the participant as the unit of analysis or whether the eye was the unit of analysis the same conclusion was drawn vessel density measures have similar diagnostic accuracy as rnfl thickness for glaucoma and glaucoma suspect detection . these results are consistent with previous reports that showed differences in oct a microvasculature between glaucoma and healthy groups in the optic disc and peripapillary region . these findings that oct a vessel density measurements and oct based rnfl thickness measurements have a similar auroc for glaucoma detection are also consistent with other studies reporting high auroc for both peripapillary vessel density measures in a thicker slab from ilm to rpe and sd oct rnfl thickness measurements aurocs 0.94 and 0.97 respectively . an unexpected finding in the current study was the significantly better diagnostic accuracy of wivd compared with cpvd for differentiating between healthy and glaucoma groups . finally because the study population comprises a high proportion of early glaucoma patients the larger measurement area may be detecting early vessel dropout associated with focal rnfl damage in early glaucoma that is more apparent in the peripapillary retina farther from the circumpapillary region included in cpvd . a number of methods have been used to document differences in blood flow between glaucoma and normal eyes but none have been appropriate for routine clinical use . moreover it is unlikely that the main finding that vessel density measures performed as well as rnfl thickness for differentiating between healthy and glaucoma participants would be affected by the age of the healthy controls as the same subjects are used in all analyses . the current study demonstrated that oct a vessel density is lower in glaucoma patients compared with healthy controls and glaucoma suspects and has a similar diagnostic accuracy to rnfl thickness for discriminating healthy subjects from glaucoma suspects and glaucoma patients . this study is unique in that it compared the diagnostic accuracy of oct a measures and standard sd oct rnfl thickness for discriminating between healthy glaucoma suspect and glaucoma patients . longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether a lower vessel density found in glaucoma patients precedes or follows optic nerve damage and whether this information can be used to improve glaucoma management .", " we report a case illustrating that wg may present with localized cutaneous manifestations preceding systemic disease . our patient initially presented with a localized rash on the truncus but his condition was insidiously complicated by malaise fever and progression of the cutaneous lesions and ultimately a diagnosis of systemic wg was established . as in our case the clinical course of wg is characterized by an initial or localized phase which may affect any organ followed by a generalized or systemic phase in approximately 80 of cases . in wg specific cutaneous lesions are seen in approximately 15 of cases and are usually associated with renal disease and musculoskeletal affection but this was not noted in our patient . however like wg these conditions often present with varying and uncharacteristic symptoms and signs and as in our case dermatological evaluation may provide valuable diagnostic information . we report a case illustrating that patients with wg may initially present with localized cutaneous symptoms and signs preceding serious systemic disease . dermatologists therefore need to be aware of wg as a possible differential diagnosis especially in patients presenting with characteristic skin manifestations and accompanying systemic symptoms and signs .", " if surgery is indicated video assisted thoracoscopic surgery vats using an endoscopic linear cutter to resect the involved blebs is currently the most popular treatment . thanks to the increased experience with therapeutic thoracoscopy that we have gained in recent years we used the technique of thoracoscopic suturing to imbricate the blebs without resection to treat the air leakage in psp patients and report here our early results . because of no abnormal pulmonary disease except for the attack of pneumothorax the surgical indications included recurrences in 11 episodes 10 patients prolonged air leakage for more than 5 days in 4 episodes 4 patients and apical blebs seen on radiography in 2 episodes 2 patients . after the full exploration of the lung surface the involved blebs were sutured with an absorbable 3 0 vicryl polyglactin suture ethicon endo surgery inc cincinatti oh . the suture puncture of the leaking blebs instead of the normal tissue in the prior operation was condemned . nevertheless using the endosuturing method to treat spontaneous pneumothorax was only reported by yim in 1995 in the english literature . although no general agreement exists about the best time for surgical intervention ie after the first or second episode vats therapy is now accepted as a definite treatment even in the first episode . the recurrence rate after the vats operation is reported to be high between 13.7 and 20 due to newly formed blebs or bullae unidentified during operation . the cause of recurrence is thought to be improper suturing with direct puncture of the blebs during the operation and thus the leakage area is not repaired well . during reoperation by vats the air leak was found near the previous sutured area which adhered intensively to the parietal pleura . the vats wedge closure of the blebs by suturing without resection of the involved blebs is a feasible and effective alternative treatment for primary spontaneous pneumothorax if cost of the endo stapler is regarded as a major problem .", " sestamibi scan revealed right inferior parathyroid adenoma and

palpation ultrasonography usg ct mri nuclear scintigraphy and combination of these tests . ct and mri scans provide excellent spatial resolution but often miss a small parathyroid adenoma . to conclude our patient had an ectopic parathyroid adenoma resulting in failed initial surgery .", " poor results such as these were replicated throughout the early and mid twentieth century and soon recognized to be secondary to cord manipulation during a laminectomy only posterior approach1718 . consequently several posterolateral and anterior approaches were developed to avoid cord manipulation such as lateral extracavitary12 and its variant costotransversectomy15 transthoracic transpleural16 transpedicular23 video assisted thoracoscopic19 and transthoracic retropleural either open20 or minimally invasive28 . given the limited visualization of the anterior dura afforded by posterolateral approaches and the frequently calcified nature of tdhs the preferred approach for midline tdhs is anteriorly through the thoracic cavity either transpleural or as recently described retropleural31029 . we present a case in which the application of intraoperative ultrasound us enabled us to successfully perform a transpedicular approach for a midline calcified tdh and discuss its potential applications and deficiencies . at this point the ultrasound probe ust9120 3.75 10 mhz multi frequency convex probe hitachi aloka tokyo japan was brought into the field and utilized to localize the anterior tdh thus confirming the t7 8 level again fig . the left t7 inferior articular process

laminectomy fig . at this point the ultrasound probe ust9120 3.75 10 mhz multi frequency convex probe hitachi aloka tokyo japan was brought into the field and utilized to localize the anterior tdh

the latest development in anterior approaches for tdh has been the minimally invasive mis lateral approach through a tubular channel . a chest tube may or may not be required depending on the surgeon s preference neurological outcomes have been very good and ebl better or equivalent to vats32829 . however visualization of the anterior dura is limited and posterolateral approaches have created a set of complications of their own especially inadequate anterior decompression of the spinal cord9 . this is however the first time it is applied to a transpedicular approach to assess cord decompression in a midline calcified tdh as such it is applicable to any open posterolateral approach and should be considered an important surgical adjunct . posterolateral approaches especially the transpedicular approaches have become the procedure of choice for off midline tdhs . the utilization of intraoperative us further expands its application to encompass midline calcified tdhs while enabling the surgeon to avoid cord manipulation . it is still unclear to us if this technique could be applied to every midline tdh particularly those suspected of having an intradural component only continued utilization will answer this question . this is a viable alternative of midline tdhs especially for surgeons unfamiliar with tubular techniques or patients who can not risk the potential complications of an anterior approach .", " acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis ahle is a rare fatal disease presenting with an acute onset of neurological abnormalities . in this disease an acute rapidly progressive hemorrhage in the white matter leads to a fulminant clinical course . the acute onset of a rapidly progressive neurological disorder with asymmetric involvement of the brain polymorphonuclear predominant peripheral leukocytosis cerebrospinal fluid csf pleocytosis and specific findings in the serial computed tomography scans or magnetic resonance imaging mri are the main criteria for the diagnosis . with a diagnosis of ahle our patient was treated with methylprednisolone 20 mg kg pulse therapy intravenous immunoglobulin ivig acyclovir 30 mg kg d and plasmapheresis 3hour sessions for 3 times . it is a more severe form of adem and is characterized by a fulminant clinical course . considering clinical and imaging findings the differential diagnosis of this disease are hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease infectious encephalitis meningitis vasculitis fulminant multiple sclerosis other causes of adem and venous sinus thrombosis . it is very difficult to distinguish other causes of adem from ahle based on clinical and mri findings and diagnosis is basically made via biopsy . in addition ahle presents more acutely and has larger and more edematous lesions with features of hemorrhage . in our patient several findings including acute fulminant course of the disease a history of parotiditis csf profiles indicative immunological and bacteriological tests and mri results strongly supported the diagnosis of ahle . still as there is evidence that ahle might have a biphasic presentation our patient should be followed up for a longer time period with several mris .", " though the overall accuracy of gleason grade on needle biopsies was found to be good in predicting prostatectomy specimen grade upgrading and downgrading large difference 2 points between biopsy derived and post prostatectomy gleason scores pgs may confuse the clinicians in consulting the patients . according to the 2005 international society of urological pathology isup consensus on gleason grading of prostatic carcinoma 8 bgs was defined as summation of primary gs and highest grade gs of all biopsy cores and pgs was defined as summation of primary and secondary gs in the prostate specimen . in group c the number of biopsy core was significantly lower but tumor volume in the pathology specimen was significantly higher and tumor was more widely distributed in the prostate specimen than the control group b p 0.001 which were different aspects from group a table 3 . of the patients in group a 73.3 diagnosed as prostate cancer of bgs 9 or 10 and their pgs fell into pgs 7 or 8 . it has been noted that there is 2040 of discrepancy between bgs and pgs in the pathology of prostate cancer 6 7 9 . interestingly in the univariate analysis the result of current study demonstrated that the patients with this large difference between gs of pre and post prostatectomy showed worse clinicopathological findings and worse prognosis in biochemical failure than the control group irrespective of increase or decrease of the pgs compared with bgs . therefore bgs of the patients in group a rather than pgs may reflect prognosis and should be considered as one of the important prognostic factors together with pathological stage . in these patients a recent study of 301 patients with low risk prostate cancer clinical stage t1c t2a psa 10 ng ml and bgs 6 who underwent an extended 10core prostate needle biopsy in men assessed with 10 12 cores the rate of gs upgrading was 47.9 which was significantly higher than 23.5 in 18 cores 17 . thus insufficient number of prostate sampling especially in small prostate containing aggressive cancer might cause gleason upgrading . however multivariate analysis showed clinical significance not in the difference of bgs and pgs but in well known prognostic factors of prostate cancer such as spsa bgs or pgs itself pt stage and surgical margin . in the clinical settings even if both of the clinicians and the patients would be confused with the somewhat large discrepancy in bgs and pgs it can be ignored compared with other well known prognostic clinicopathological factors . however the clinicians had better kept in mind that many of these patients who showed large discrepancy in bgs and pgs might have other unfavorable clinicopathological factors of prostate cancer . in summary clinical

the effectiveness of sputum induction in obtaining good quality sputum in children with clinically suspected alrti in the everyday busy general hospital setting . sputum samples were cultured for 48 hours using routine microbiological procedures . to assess the agreement between sputum and nasopharyngeal bacterial cultures a simple coefficient was calculated . sputum samples were cultured for 48 hours using routine microbiological procedures . to assess the agreement between sputum and nasopharyngeal bacterial cultures a simple coefficient was calculated . in 15 sputum samples a bacterial pathogen was also found in the concomitant nasopharyngeal culture 19 nasopharyngeal cultures yielded bacterial pathogens that were not found in concomitant sputum cultures . no significant associations between the sputum and nasopharyngeal bacterial yield were found with the exception of haemophilus influenzae 0.538 . this study shows that good quality sputum samples could be obtained by an induced sputum collection procedure in our everyday busy general hospital setting in 91 of children with clinically suspected alrti . bacterial pathogens were found in 25 of induced sputum samples . in 29 of positive sputum cultures the bacterial pathogen was found only in sputum and not in the concomitant nasopharyngeal aspirate culture suggesting its origin from the lower respiratory tract . the relatively low percentage of bacterial pathogens detected from induced sputum samples is probably a result of the fact that many alrtis were in fact viral infections as is common in young children . induced sputum not only identifies bacterial pathogens but can also help exclude bacterial infections and thus reduce overtreatment with antibiotics when comparing our results with those of a similar study performed by mermond et al there is a difference in bacterial sputum yield 25 vs 50 . another limitation of our study is that we can not rule out the possibility that occasionally the induced sputum did not reflect the etiology of the alrti because we did not compare the induced sputum cultures with material retrieved directly from the lungs by bronchoalveolar lavage or thoracocentesis which would obviously have been unethical to perform in these non critically ill children . it is likely that many bacteria cultured from induced sputum during an acute respiratory tract infection play a causative role .", " compared to a sample of 70year old population of uppsala sweden subjects of this study had lower mean daytime sbp with 9 mmhg mean dbp and pp with 5 mmhg but the same variability standard deviation . compared to a sample age 73 6 from a population of madrid spain at daytime mean values of sbp dbp pp and sd were very similar with only 1 2 mmhg differences . compared to younger elderly 5059 and 6069 y subjects of this study had similar daytime and nighttime sbp but lower daytime dbp with 7 mmhg and nighttime dbp with 3 mmhg . compared to the subgroup at age 6069 y subjects of this study had lower daytime sbp with mean 12 mmhg daytime dbp with 10 mmhg the same nighttime sbp and lower dbp with 3 mmhg . compared to the subgroup at age 5059 y subjects of this study had lower daytime sbp with mean 3 mmhg daytime dbp with 5 mmhg higher nighttime sbp with 6 mmhg and lower dbp with 2 mmhg . when hypertension was defined with the same criteria at age 81 table 2 left columns the values of abpm examined the same year differed between the groups and presented in hypertensive subjects higher daytime sbp and pp and higher nocturnal sbp and pp and higher pre and postawakening sbp but we have previously shown that blood pressure dynamics differed in these study subjects during the followup . those who presented higher clinic bp levels at age 68 were prone to have declining sbp until age 81 . in addition abi levels at age 68 correlated negatively with future sbp variability and with pulse pressure at daytime presenting the lowest abi levels in subjects with highest daytime sbp variability and pulse pressure . the time course of abi between age 68 and 82 showed that the largest abi decline was reflected by higher daytime and nighttime systolic variability that is sd sbp and by higher pp as well as by higher pre and postawakening sbp levels but not by daytime or nighttime sbp dbp levels at age 82 . compared to latter studies performed in cohorts aged 7079 y octogenarians from our study had generally lower daytime levels of sbp dbp and in some cases even lower nighttime sbp dbp levels . this age related threshold of abpm values could be supported by our observation that the higher level of office bp or suffering from hypertension at age 68 did not predict higher abpm neither daytime nor nighttime at age 82 . by analyzing abpm values in hypertensive and normotensive subjects at age 82 we could conclude that low values of abpm in the whole cohort were partly due to low abpm values in those men who were hypertensive at age 68 and at the same time developed decline of clinic bp until their 80ties . abpm could also adequately express the grade of atherosclerotic process at age 82 by higher nighttime and preawakening bp levels higher nighttime bp variability and pp values in those men who had higher grade of carotid stenosis lower abi and extended abi decline during the 14year followup . possible explanation of the lower abpm values in the very elderly compared to the younger population samples could be a selective mortality of those subjects from our cohort who died before age 68 that is before the first followup due to early hypertension metabolic syndrome intensive smoking and advanced atherosclerosis . similarly lower abi level at age 68 predicted higher daytime sbp variability and pp and not the absolute abpm values . at age 81 subjects defined as hypertensive expressed higher nighttime and daytime sbp post and preawakening sbp and above all higher pp . the values of clinic bp at age 81 correlated with values of abpm mainly clinic dbp high values which were reflected by higher daytime and nighttime sbp dbp sd sbp and pre and postawakening sbp as well as daytime pp . it suggests that in very elderly men clinic dbp seems to express overall 24h bp profile in a more adequate way that clinic sbp and that diurnal pp should be used as an important complement to both clinic and diurnal bp measurements . nocturnal values of abpm could be used as a risk factor or marker of vascular burden in the octogenarian men . in conclusion in a population sample cohort of 82year old men high daytime and nighttime abpm measurements reflected increasing office bp and aggravating atherosclerosis only in the last decade .", " the frontier of regenerative medicine nowadays is represented by the mesenchymal stem cells mscs overcoming the ethical problems thanks to the use of mesenchymal stem cells from adult patient and with the increasingly sophisticated technology to support their manipulation mscs are undoubtedly the future of medicine regenerative and they are showing perspectives unimaginable just a few years ago . most recent studies are aimed to tissues regeneration using mscs taken from sites that are even more accessible and rich in stem cells the oral cavity turned out to be an important source of mscs with the advantage to be easily accessible to the surgeon thus avoiding to increase the morbidity of the patient . the regenerative medicine involves the use of biomaterials growth factors and stem cells 17 . regeneration of the tissues exists naturally due to the presence of stem cells with the potential to self regenerate and differentiate into one of more specialized cell types . in the last decade several improvements have been produced in the comprehension of stem cells properties in view of the fact that these cells have an important role in the repair of every organ and tissue . recently orofacial and dental tissues have acquired interest as a further accessible source of mesenchymal stem cells 33 due to the fact that the oral area is rich in mscs table 1 . today every cell population which has the following characteristics independently of its tissue source is usually referred as mscs i they adhere to plastic and have a fibroblast like morphology ii they have the capacity of self renewal and could differentiate into cells of the mesenchymal lineage such as osteocytes chondrocytes and adipocytes . research related to msc from oral origin began in 2000 37 and every year numerous investigations have demonstrated that oral tissues which are simply available for dentists are a rich source for mesenchymal stem cells 3338 . these cells possess phenotypic characteristics similar to those of bmscs 39 and they have definitive stem cell properties such as self renewal and multi differentiation capacity and can form the dentin pulp structure when transplanted into immunocompromised mice 40 . the periodontal ligament is another adult mscs source in dental tissue and periodontal ligament stem cells pdlscs were isolated from extracted teeth 48 . have isolated mesenchymal stem cells from the gingiva these mscs exhibited higher clonogenicity self renewal and multipotent differentiation capacity similar to that of bmscs 54 . the mscs contained within the bone marrow aspiration from the iliac crest and liposuction from extra oral tissue are not easily accessible stem cells . in addition even if impacted wisdom teeth could be a mesenchymal stem cell source these mscs are present in a low percentage and can therefore be difficult to isolate purify and expand . it was reported that mscs isolated from whole bone marrow aspirates in combination with scaffolds and growth factors are able to repair cranial defects in several animal models 58 60 . the identification of msc residing in the oral cavity tissues increases clinical interest in mscs as a cell source for regeneration of other connective tissues such as cementum dentin and periodontal ligament pdl . many research studies research have been performed to assess the capacity of dental derived mscs to enhance periodontal regeneration . have demonstrated that human pdlscs were able to generate a cementum pdl like structures when transplanted into immunocompromised mice and consequently transplantation of pdlscs could be considered as a therapeutic approach for regeneration of tissues damaged by periodontal diseases 48 . starting from 2000 in only fifteen years researchers have changed the face of the tissues engineering and the expectation of quality of life in more than 2 billions of patients undergone to a regenerative surgery the challenge is to continue to make the patient s life better to make the surgery more predictable and to simply replace damaged or degenerated tissues with mscs from dental and oral sources .", " recent genome wide association studies gwas and other human genetic studies have localized

logtg . we found that the number of risk alleles correlated strongly with the blood lipid levels for all four parameters . the aim of this study was to identify associations between 144 snps selected from published gwas and blood lipid levels in the latvian population . this is the first report in which many genetic loci involved in a number of lipid related metabolic pathways were simultaneously studied in a relatively large group representing the latvian population 420 males 853 females for detailed data see table 1 . our study has convincingly identified associations between 16 of the 139 most strongly associated snps and one or more blood lipid parameters . in our previous case control study we reported strong associations between 10 snps in cetp and reduced hdl cholesterol radovica et al . in this study we confirmed this strong evidence for this association between the cetp gene and hdl cholesterol levels and discovered the new association of two snps at the mlxipl locus table 2 using quantitative analyses . moreover haplotype analyses also confirmed the associations demonstrated in our previous study radovica et al . supporting the association between snps in the mlxipl locus and hdl cholesterol their relationship within the lipid metabolic pathways is not as direct as that of the snp cetp association . we also found that a snp in the tomm40 locus is associated with increased ldl cholesterol levels table 2 . since the number of associated snps was found in cetp and mlxipl gene we estimated the association of individual haplotypes with all lipid levels . we found four pairs of snps that showed probable interactions in their associations with blood lipid parameters . for a more detailed analysis and to find other strongly associated snps at our test loci we performed imputation for 11 loci that contained five or more snps celsr2 apob hmgcr mlxipl lpl apoa15 kntc1niacr1 lipc cetp and tomm40apoe . we found many imputed snps in the cetp gene that were associated with changes in hdl cholesterol levels although none of these associations was stronger than those of the originally genotyped snps fig these results again agree well with those of our previous study in that cetp is the strongest and most common genetic factor to influence hdl cholesterol levels in the latvian population . imputed snps at another three loci apob lpl and tomm40 were significantly associated with one or more lipid trait fig . to achieve our aim we performed an allele dosage association test with nominally associated snps each representing one haploblock for all four blood lipid parameters to calculate the influence of the number of risk alleles on lipid levels . there was a strong correlation between the number of risk alleles and the plasma lipid levels for all four lipid parameters fig . therefore it is possible that the discovery and inclusion of additional lipid influencing snps in similar analyses will lead to the development of prognostic tests for dyslipidemia and the prescription of appropriate drugs . the results of this study confirm that of all the genes included in the analysis cetp mlxipl and tomm40 are the genetic factors that most strongly influence the plasma lipid levels in our study population . we have also shown that these risk alleles have strong cumulative effects on all lipid parameters . cadcoronary artery

and conjugated bilirubin of 1.25 mg dl . the liver enzymes including total and direct bilirubin worsened while awaiting results from the biopsies . despite steroids his total bilirubin on hd 20 had increased up to 9.22 mg dl with conjugated bilirubin of 5.76 mg dl . older regimens such as mopp mechlorethamine vincristine procarbazine prednisone are less effective than abvd.23 there is a paucity of data and published case reports for treatment of patients with hl and severely impaired liver function as this patient presented . case reports have been published using chemotherapy agents for patients with hl presenting with high bilirubin levels.46 many of the active agents used in treatment for hl require extensive dose reduction for severe liver impairment table 3 . liver involvement is uncommon at presentation in patients with hl and is exceptionally rare in the absence of splenic involvement.78 the hepatic involvement could range from hepatic infiltration by lymphoma to biliary obstruction by lymph node masses or infiltration of the common bile duct.911 the lfts in our case revealed a cholestatic picture with high alkaline phosphatase and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia . vanishing bile duct syndrome as a cause of jaundice has also been reported to be associated with hl.41213 in one case report bilirubin level normalized after two cycles of mopp one cycle of reduced dose pvag prednisone vinblastine was excluded due to potential neurotoxicity doxorubicin and gemcitabine followed by six cycles of full dose pv ag from 5.4 to 0.15 mg dl.4 however the treatment course in that case was complicated with prolonged fever pancytopenia severe peripheral polyneuropathy and toxic interstitial pneumonitis requiring intensive care after receiving two cycles of mopp . a retrospective study has shown that gemcitabine combined with vinorelbine or cisplatinum and steroid is an effective treatment option with a manageable toxicity profile in patients with post transplant progression of hl and in patients eligible for allogeneic or second autologous stem cell transplantation as a pre transplant option.18 manufacturer drug package insert and phase i pharmacokinetic trials of gemcitabine in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction have demonstrated that dose adjustments are not necessary for elevated transaminases nor elevated bilirubin and creatinine levels.1920 finally chromosomal abnormalities in hl have not been well studied to characterize a coherent cytogenetic picture.21 recent studies have designated some common chromosomal aberrations including gains of short arm of chromosome 2 involving rel oncogene locus122 and chromosomal breakpoints involving immunoglobulin loci.23 frequent occurrence of abnormalities involving 1p 1q and 6q chromosomal arms was shown in a case series.21 the cytogenetic studies in our case were not typical for hl except 6q involvement and the clinical significance of these chromosomal findings and its disappearance in complete remission still remains to be elucidated . in summary we present an unusual case of hl with severe hepatic impairment splenomegaly and multiple chromosomal abnormalities which was treated successfully with gemcitabine and steroids to initially improve lfts such that six cycles of abvd could be given .", " in total 548 patients 91.3 had preoperative wbc counts under

correlation with cancer free survival or overall survival . thus in the current study regardless of the preoperative and postoperative inflammatory status the groups were classified by the normalization of wbc count . these results demonstrate that the differences in surgical methods according to stage did not affect the postoperative wbc count or dsnlc . in a univariate analysis the presence of increased wbcs in the preoperative stages did not affect the duration of disease free survival or overall survival . in this study an early operative increase in wbc correlates with increased innate immunity and this increase is predictive of a poorer outcome for colorectal cancer more so than monocyte or nlr increase which only shows an increase in innate immunity at one point of time . preoperative wbc count shows a correlation with an increase of cancer stage with the exception of stage iv . in addition patients receiving preoperative radiation show statistically significant shorter periods for normalization of wbc counts compared to patients not receiving radiation therapy . postoperative increase in wbc count has many contributory factors such as cancer cell itself surgical complications radiation therapy chemotherapy and surgical methods . wbc count decrease was observed in cases that had preoperative radiation or chemotherapy . in addition the wbc count normalization period after surgery did not correlate with the presence of combined resection but rather correlated with the duration of postoperative hospital stay . in this study three factors surgical approach method preoperative radiation therapy and postoperative hospital stay were found to be associated with the difference in time of the period of normalization of wbc count . thus we can conclude that preoperativeand postoperative inflammatory response and period unfavorably affect the metastatic microenvironment .", " tailgut cysts also known as retrotrectal cystic hamartomas are

role in differential diagnostics between retrorectal tumors and planning the surgical management of retrorectal lesions including tailgut cysts . cect report suggested the lesion most likely to represent tailgut duplication cyst retrorectal cystic hamartoma . bilobed retrorectal cyst axial view of retro rectal tailgut cyst following discussion it was decided that surgical excision of this lesion was the most appropriate course of action given its symptomatology and uncertain malignant potential . despite the fact that the majority of tailgut cysts are benign and can very rarely undergo malignant transformation and then most common histopathologic diagnoses are adenocarcinoma or carcinoid . due to the location of tailgut cysts almost all of them are palpable on rectal examination as extrinsic contained fluctuant masses . rarely they may identify a sacrococcygeal anomaly associated with tailgut cysts . the appearance of a tailgut cyst on ct imaging is usually of a well defined thin walled uni or multi locular nonenhancing lesion in the retrorectal space . mri has become the modality of choice to image tailgut cysts because of its multiplanar imaging capability allowing imaging of surgically relevant planes as well as its good soft tissue contrast . the anatomical position and rarity of the tailgut cyst lead to difficulty firstly in diagnosis the lesion is often misdiagnosed and secondly in surgical management the condition is often suboptimally managed .", " the aim of this review article as a tribute to ibn al nafis was to introduce his valuable but

for preventing thrombus formation in patients with acute coronary syndromes including those with st segment elevation myocardial infarction stemi non stemi nstemi or unstable angina . thus fondaparinux has a favorable tolerability profile particularly with regard to the risk of major bleeding . in the oasis5 trial fondaparinux has been shown to reduce major bleeding with similar short term efficacy as enoxaparin and lowers death and stroke during long term follow up in patients with acute coronary syndromes undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention . on comparison with a heparin based therapy fondaparinux reduce mortality ischemic events and major bleeding across the full spectrum of acute coronary syndromes . there are few reports of heparin induced thrombocytopenia hit related to fondaparinux in a patient previously exposed to unfractionated heparin ufh and delayed onset hit caused during its prophylaxis . major bleeding is known to exist with the use of fondaparinux in previously exposed heparin user but to best of our knowledge there exist no isolated case report presenting with fondaparinux induced major bleeding in elderly postmenopausal women prescribed for recently diagnosed nstemi . we hereby report a rare case of fondaparinux induced major bleeding in a 58year old postmenopausal woman a known hypertensive and type 2 diabetes mellitus t2

operative assessment of dental occlusion was required orotracheal intubation was not indicated with nasotracheal intubation also being inappropriate due to his nasoorbitoethmoidal fracture . prior to intubation the universal connector of a reinforced endotracheal tube ett was detached gently from the tube and reattached so that it could be easily disconnected during the procedure fig . the stay suture was removed and the ett with a pilot balloon was retracted from the oral cavity removed via the mouth and brought back to the orotracheal position . following orotracheal intubation with a reinforced ett internal diameter 7.5 mm the tube was removed through the submental area using the aforementioned method . as intra operative assessment of dental occlusion was required orotracheal intubation was not indicated with nasotracheal intubation also being inappropriate due to his nasoorbitoethmoidal fracture . prior to intubation the universal connector of a reinforced endotracheal tube ett was detached gently from the tube and reattached so that it could be easily disconnected during the procedure fig . the stay suture was removed and the ett with a pilot balloon was retracted from the oral cavity removed via the mouth and brought back to the orotracheal position . following orotracheal intubation with a reinforced ett internal diameter 7.5 mm the tube was removed through the submental area using the aforementioned method . although orotracheal intubation is the most frequently used route in securing the airway it interferes with the surgical field and disturbs intra operative assessment of dental occlusion . submental intubation is also applied to bimaxillary orthognathic surgeries with simultaneous rhinoplasty or orthognathic surgeries in patients with large pharyngeal flaps or other anatomic anomalies precluding nasotracheal intubation . as he was healthy with the exception of his nasoorbitoethmoidal fracture and did not require prolonged ventilatory support the decision to choose submental intubation over tracheostomy had greater significance . in the second case nevertheless submental intubation was chosen because of his alert mental status in addition to his unrequired use of long term airway support . in comparison the complications associated with submental intubation are less severe and lower in frequency . submental intubation removes the ett from the surgical field thereby providing a clear surgical field that also assists in preventing injuries of the ett . the submental intubation technique is a reliable alternative to tracheostomy in patients undergoing complex maxillofacial surgeries who do not require prolonged ventilatory support .", " fluoroquinolones are widely used antimicrobials which cause cutaneous adverse

in drosophila knowledge of the cellular basis for sperm tail elongation is necessary . we have undertaken a cell biological approach to identify the mechanism of sperm tail elongation in drosophila . two giant mitochondria elongate together with microtubules and push cell membrane of elongating sperm tail . through genetic perturbation of mitochondrial functions we discovered that mitochondria play an essential role in sperm tail elongation . during spermatid elongation giant mitochondrial lobes elongate in parallel to the axoneme to fill the entire length of sperm tail fig . another double membrane organelle nucleus showing similar morphological diversification in sperm across species is also likely serving as an alternative shaping tool for sperm morphogenesis . having outlined the process of sperm tail elongation we are in the position of starting a comparative analysis of spermatid elongation in drosophila melanogaster strains with long and short sperm . in addition gigantic sperms in drosophilidae appear to have multiple evolutional origins it will be of interest to search for the crucial process that may have permitted the appearance of long sperm by asking which step of sperm elongation differs most between closely related species of long and short sperm . measurement of the size of spermatocyte and nebenkern speed of elongation time required to reach full length and requirement of microtubules and mitochondria should clarify whether the mitochondria driven elongation mechanism is used in other drosophilidae species with extremely long sperms . thus the sperm elongation mechanism described in this report might be a general system for facilitating sperm size variation among insects with giant mitochondria thereby enhancing sexual selection and reproductive isolation .", " since most manufacturers of direct resin based restorative materials do not provide details about the photoinitiators contained in their products narrow blue led light spectra emission is ideal for photopolymerization of camphorquinone containing materials but this may not be such efficient when other photoinitiators such as 1phenyl12propanedione are present in very light composite shades high color value used for repair of bleached teeth . while many publications have discussed the physical properties of led light cured materials few have investigated the color stability of resin based restorative materials when cured with qth and led lights . monowave and polywave led lcus and qth lcus have not previously been compared in terms of efficiency in curing resin cement under indirect restorative materials . the purpose of this study was therefore to evaluate the effect of color changes in a resin cement material polymerized under different restorations using different light polymerizing units . the hypothesis of this study would be different curing systems and different interface materials effects the resin cement color stability at different time interval . the color of each specimen was measured three times before polymerization and twice after polymerization 2040 s for qth and monowave led and 36 s for polywave led using a colorimeter shade eye nnc shofu

in table 2 . results of three way anova both interface materials ceramic and composite resin are induced less color change than the control group p 0.05 . this study investigated the color of indirect composite or ceramic restoration after cementation with resin cement using differently lcus . since contemporary led lights provide superior irradiance expanded lifetime little light output degradation over time to qth light led lights are expected to optimally polymerize resin materials as or even more effectively than qth . in the current study color changes in specimens polymerized with monowave led were statistically greater than those in halogen based polymerizing units and polywave led lcus p 0.05 . this may explain the color changes in the specimens polymerized with polywave led lcus used in this study being greater than the color change values in specimens polymerized with monowave led lcus . has shown that high intensity led unit is more effective than qth units during polymerization of dual cure cement trough ceramic material . has reported that led units emit more homogenous light and thus yield more uniform distribution of surface hardness knoop hardness number of a resin composite than halogen units . considering the methodology applied and the limitations of this in vitro study it can be concluded that different curing units and interface materials have a significant effect on the final color of resin cement . more studies are now needed to evaluate the efficiency of polymerization of mono polywave led lcus and to evaluate the effect of different interface materials on color stability of resin cement .", " in the most teaching centers formal training provided to a beginner who learns the procedure under the supervision of an expert who intervenes only at if complications occur or the duration of surgery is too long.456 in a stepwise training program phacoemulsification surgery is divided into various steps and proficiency in one step leads to next step under the guidance and supervision of an expert trainer.7 some centers in the developed world use simulators.89 the road to sics aided by phacoemulsification is said to be slippery with vitreous . numerous studies of resident training focus on preserving the posterior capsule and limiting vitreous loss.710111213 a novel technique of reverse method of training in which the final steps of the surgical technique are taught first and the initial steps are taught last was attempted in brazil.14 however it has never been compared to the traditional start to finish supervised method of teaching phacoemulsification surgery . the aim of the study was to compare start to finish or conventional method to the reverse method of training with regards to posterior capsular rupture pcr in phacoemulsification surgery at a teaching institute . the incidence of pcr depends on the level of skill of a surgeon hence surgeons learning phacoemulsification surgery in the institution were divided into two groups . beginners were thus not novice surgeons who were performing cataract surgery for the 1 time but had some experience with manual sics and were now upgrading their skills for phacoemulsification . they were supervised by 3 trainers 2 female each of whom had an experience of at least 8000 cataract surgeries of at least 1000 were phacoemulsification cases . twelve surgeons taught with the reverse method later performed 722 phacoemulsification surgeries trainee group next 31 100 cases and pcr occurred in 31 4.3 cases p 0.705 chi square test for comparison between trainees of the two groups . a study assessing the difficulty of the various steps of phacoemulsification surgery reported an incidence of pcr of 9.16 the most difficult steps were phacoemulsification of the nucleus and capsulorhexis.16 the steps considered most challenging that carried the greatest risks were emulsification of the nucleus and cortex aspiration . thomas observed two residents in early stage of learning phacoemulsification and noted an incidence of pcr of 10 although they were familiar with sics.13 hennig stated that in unsupervised learning formal training and stepwise formal training the incidence of pcr was 15 10 and 4.8 respectively thus advocating stepwise formal training for beginner.4 studies of complications during surgical residency training from germany and usa reported an incidence of pcr of 3.8 and 3.1 respectively during phacoemulsification training.710 reports from taiwan and usa evaluating the learning curve of phacoemulsification in resident surgeons reported an incidence of pcr of 4.9 and 5.1 respectively.1112 the us study noticed that the incidence of pcr decreased from 5.1 to 1.9 after 80 surgeries indicating safety and efficiency improved with experience . the brazilian council of ophthalmology in partnership with alcon brazil used the reverse method to teach phacoemulsification surgery . the incidence of pcr in this study was 13.1.14 india has a large pool of young ophthalmologists who need phacoemulsification training.17 the feedback from residency training programs showed that surgical training for residents was considered inadequate by many of the respondents.18 one reason is that the residency chief believed surgical teaching may compromise on the quality of patient care.1920 many young ophthalmologists therefore seek special phacoemulsification training after the completion of their residency and fellowship programs . in addition our beginners were surgeons with some experience in manual sics and not residents performing cataract surgery for the 1 time or those who were only familiar with ecce .", " this study considered the usefulness of the subject performed task spt manipulation in improving wm in early ad and healthy older adult controls in a task measuring the ability to verbally repeat short sequences of instructions . in general research shows that enacted encoding facilitates later memory performance relative to control conditions in which no enactment occurs during encoding . spt has been found to enhance recall in several clinical groups including parkinson s disease and autism spectrum disorder asd yet research with ad participants has generated mixed findings . the first study to investigate spt in individuals with ad failed to find an enactment effect on ltm and of those studies that have observed an effect the majority have found it in instances of cued recall but not free recall . in contrast the most recent study to investigate the enactment effect in mild ad patients demonstrated superior recall for spt relative to verbal only encoding tasks in free recall as well as in semantic cued recall and object cued recall . in fact this study demonstrated that the benefit of object cued recall was greater for ad patients than neurologically intact older adults thus highlighting encoding specificity as a principle that might enhance recall in ad . to summarize the present study examines the advantage of spt over verbal only encoding tasks in individuals with early ad using a recently developed wm task . as the instruction task has been shown to rely heavily on wm abilities and because patients with early ad have wm deficits we predicted that this group would perform poorer relative to an older adult control group . it was expected that healthy older adult control participants would show a substantial benefit of encoding based enactment . in contrast if instead the benefit of enacted encoding relies more on automatic nonstrategic and multimodal encoding we predict that spt will enhance remembering in ad patients as well as older adult controls . this revealed a main effect of group f127 14.16 p 0.001 and p 0.34 such that older adult control participants recalled significantly more elements from the action object instruction sequences than did ad patients . in order to explore the group length interaction data was collapsed across encoding condition and paired samples t tests indicated that increasing sequence length had a greater effect on the recall performance of older adult controls than it did on ad participants t29 7.08 p 0.001 and d 1.38 and t27 2.95 p 0.006 and d 0.56 respectively . this study examined the memory performance of individuals with early ad and older adult controls on an instruction task that required the temporary storage in wm and subsequent recall of action object sequences following self enactment spt or a baseline control condition vt . the primary focus of the present study was to establish whether the wm performance of ad patients would benefit from self enactment at encoding . the findings reveal that verbal recall in both older adults and individuals with ad was significantly facilitated by the performance of actions on objects at encoding . more generally the basic task of following and recalling instructions might be useful in detecting early stage ad . what implications might these findings have both for the enactment effect in wm and for the nature of the cognitive deficit in ad wojcik et al . found no memory improvement from spt on free recall tasks they showed that ad patients experience an enactment effect in semantic cued recall . this suggests that patients require support at both encoding and retrieval in order for enhanced recall via self performance . our results demonstrate a positive encoding based enactment effect in wm across older adults and patients with early ad . findings also support previous research which shows that recall is facilitated in ad by the availability of cues at both encoding and retrieval .", " he had a past history of myocardial infarction mi two years back and was advised

knowledge this is the first case report describing incidentally detected mesenteric pseudocyst of small bowel in gastric cancer patients .", " most conducted studies in iran have reported the hev prevalence in specific groups and studies on hev prevalence in general populations are limited . hev prevalence information in general population can be a better indicator of the public health and hygiene . no data is available so far on the prevalence of hev among general population of ahvaz city therefore this study was conducted to determine the prevalence of hev among adults in south west of iran . to estimate the prevalence of anti hev igg and igm antibodies in the general population of ahvaz city 510 blood samples from the adult population of ahvaz city were collected randomly using the multistage cluster sampling method from february to july 2014 . with regard to gender and race 86206 41.7 in the male group and 149304 49 in the female group were positive for anti hev igg antibodies . epidemiological studies in different parts of the world show the wide variation in hev prevalence patterns though the hev seroprevalence rates are higher among less developed countries . in 2005 reported hev seroprevalence rate of 3.8 among general population in isfahan province iran . study hev prevalence was 9.3 in general population of tehran . the prevalence of hev was reported to be 7.8 in khorramabad city in 2009 . regarding hev prevalence among the general population of other countries the overall hev prevalence rate was reported to be 22.5 among general population in bangladesh by labrique et al . in the present study we investigated the hev seroprevalence among adult population in ahvaz city and found that anti hev igg and igm seroprevalence were 46.1 and 1.4 respectively . our data showed that the anti hev igg prevalence rate among adult population in ahvaz is 46.1 the highest rate reported in different parts of iran . in conclusion high anti hev igg seroprevalence of 46.1 was observed among the adults population living in ahvaz city of iran . determination of hev prevalence in different regions can be used for the purpose of hev epidemiology by developing a prevalence map on the base of hev geographical distribution . in addition to epidemiological purposes hev prevalence information is important in evaluating the public health and hygiene and in identifying the major route of hev transmission in iran .", " in this regard studies have illustrated a considerably high diagnostic value of ultrasonography in detection of thoracic fractures even higher than that of chest radiography 8 10 12 . nevertheless still no comprehensive review has been carried out comparing the diagnostic values of chest ultrasonography and radiography in

the present meta analysis sensitivity of chest ultrasonography in detection of thoracic bone fractures following trauma was prominently higher than radiography 97 vs. 77 . on this basis and according to calculated likelihood ratios a negative result of ultrasonography in detection of thoracic fracture is more reliable than radiography negative likelihood ratio0.03 while a positive result of chest radiography is more reliable than ultrasonography positive likelihood ratio774.63 . subgroup analysis of diagnostic accuracy for chest radiography and ultrasonography in detection of thoracic bone fractures p value 0.1 was considered as significant for heterogeneity ci confidence interval . ultrasonography had a higher sensitivity in diagnosis of rib fractures rather than other chest wall bones while the type of fracture had no effect on diagnostic value of radiography . some narrative review articles and qualitative systematic reviews are indicative of the potential benefit of ultrasonography in detection of chest wall fractures . in this regard chan in his systematic review conducted on studies indexed in medline declares that ultrasonography has a higher sensitivity in detection of thoracic bone fractures compared to radiography 13 . base on the findings of the present meta analysis screening performance characteristic of ultrasonography in detection of thoracic

intervention trials spanning 7 countries sabate et al . the average bmi of participants in the present trial is 33.2 4.4 and lipid regulating effects were not observed as a result of a walnut supplemented ad libitum diet . we observed a beneficial trend in blood pressure reduction at the end of the walnut supplemented ad libitum diet phase when compared with the ad libitum diet alone . our observations correspond with other nut and walnut consumption trials that have observed either a positive or a neutral influence on blood pressure responsiveness with increased consumption . the lack of weight increase seen during the walnut enriched phase of the trial could be explained by participants partially substituting walnuts for other foods in the diet and by walnuts ability to increase energy expenditures while providing a high satiety and low metabolizable energy source . of note waist circumference declined during the walnut study phase despite a higher calorie intake . lastly this trial showed that a walnut enriched ad libitum diet does not change fasting plasma glucose fasting insulin and homa ir levels when compared with the control diet . we acknowledge that our study has several limitations the most important being the absence of a prescribed standardized diet which would then allow us to attribute the findings to the only independent variable under investigation

who do not handle orthopoxviruses could be vaccinated in the same fashion as other health care and public health workers who have at least 1 recent since 2003 documented successful vaccination 5 . most barriers to revaccination were related to medical conditions compromised immunity andor exfoliative skin disorders that place vaccinees at high risk for adverse events to the currently licensed smallpox vaccine . the risk to the us population from a release of smallpox this reduced risk stems not from a lower threat from terrorism but from the existence of a stockpile of the new acam2000 smallpox vaccine in addition to a cadre of health care and public health professionals who could be revaccinated quickly and mobilized accordingly 12 . future opportunities may arise to challenge the vaccine with the actual virus to measure vaccine efficacy and provide sound recommendations to protect all public health and health care responders against smallpox 13 .", " herein we describe the case of a patient suffering acute ischemic stroke due to paradoxical embolization of dense fibrous material through a pfo following transvenous lead extraction tle . thrombi can be detected on the leads in around 30 of patients by toe and intracardiac ultrasound 2 3 and findings of asymptomatic pulmonary emboli in up to 15 of patients as well as increased pulmonary pressure point toward a high rate of subclinical embolism in patients with cardiovascular implantable electronic devices cieds 1 3 4 . one particular concern is the risk of systemic thromboembolism in patients with intracardiac shunts and cieds in all shunts other than pfos the risk of systemic thromboembolism is doubled 5 and such conditions are at present considered a contraindication for endocardial lead placement 6 . although the rate of stroke seems to be low 0.1 during tle our case highlights the potentially dramatic consequences of systemic embolization even in the absence of visible vegetations on the leads . the use of distal embolization protection devices during tle in patients with vegetations has been reported in several cases whether in the pulmonary 11 or systemic circulation 12 . however the efficacy of these devices seems limited by the risk of delayed embolism as demonstrated in our case and because residual dense fibrinous tissue probably persists for several days or weeks . based on our case and these considerations we believe paradoxical embolism causing stroke is a real concern in patients with pfos undergoing tle .", " postural control evaluation and training are important contributors to the rehabilitation of balance walking ability and other daily living activities performed by stroke patients3 4 . limits of stability los the maximum center of gravity displacement possible without loss of balance are also reduced in stroke patients . damage to the central nervous system function directly affects posture movement and thus balance ability . reduced muscle strength and mobility the hemiparesis that often results from stroke tends to force patients to complete movements using a compensation strategy e.g. however this behavior does not require postural control so nervous impulses to the affected side reduce which further hinders functional recovery of the affected side in rehabilitation121314 . this means that techniques which oblige stroke patients to practice centralized postural and balance control on the affected side will have considerable impact on the stroke patients recovery of balance walking and other mobility related functions . this study reports the results of two subjects who used the device for movement control training of the affected side . the tools used to evaluate performance were the berg balance scale bbs15 16 14 balance tasks scored on a five point 04 scale with 0 representing the poorest performance the motor assessment scale mas17 which evaluates motor function on a seven point 06 scale in this study only items relevant to standing balance were used and the newly developed device was used to evaluate the cop distribution . the evaluation included the cop motion distribution of the left and right feet and whole body while standing with the eyes open for one minute and standing with the eyes closed for one minute . the effect on balance performance training using the device was assessed using two patients . the bbs improvement of case a was 19.44 and that of case b was 11.9 showing that the interactive game used in this study can help stroke patients improve their balancing ability on the

the right affected side presumably because the patient habitually supported standing with the healthy side . patient a showed considerable improvement in static standing balance control with his eyes open . it is our opinion that patient a made significant progress in all aspects of balance because testing occurred after a shorter recovery period and patient a had not recovered as much mobility as patient b leading to larger training effects . in summary an interactive game with dual force and different side ratio developed for this study can help stroke patients train their balance on their stroke affected side but this method is only effective for patients who have recently experienced stroke and offers little benefit to patients who have recovered a significant degree of mobility .", " the cag repeats are translated into polyglutamine tracts in protein products and the entire group of resulting disorders is known as the polyglutamine polyq diseases . the expanded repeats are thought to exert their pathogenic effects at the protein level mainly through a gain of toxic function by the mutant protein . in dm1 the gain of toxic function by mutant transcript containing cug repeats 1comparison of the lengths of the cag repeat tracts that occur in polyq disease related transcripts and the cug repeats in the transcript responsible for dm1 . in this review we first discuss the main cellular and molecular hallmarks of the mutant protein and mutant rna gain of function mechanisms from studies of polyq diseases and dm1 pathogenesis . we then present recent findings indicating that transcripts containing expanded cag repeats might also be toxic and contribute to the pathogenesis of polyq disorders . finally we focus on the experimental models used to demonstrate rna toxicity in polyq diseases . we discuss the features of these models and propose generating new cellular and animal models dedicated to elucidating the toxic effects triggered by mutant rna and protein in polyq diseases . the protein products of genes that undergo mutations leading to polyq diseases differ in their cellular functions and cover a wide range of molecular weights . the cellular hallmarks of polyq diseases are nuclear and cytoplasmic amyloid like aggregates formed by mutant proteins their proteolytic fragments 35 36 or by fragments translated from aberrantly spliced shorter mrnas that sequester other proteins predominantly those containing unstructured regions 24 28 38 . however in efforts aimed at demonstrating rna toxicity in polyq diseases reference to dm1 and other rna

between the cag and cug repeats in transcripts 10 17 the first compelling experimental evidence for such an involvement was provided in 2008 by bonini and colleagues . thus it is likely that the pathogenesis of polyq disorders involves at least to some extent the primary elements of the rna gain of function mechanism that is well characterized in dm1 . the recent study by chan and colleagues revealed that cag repeat expansion induces nucleolar stress in polyglutamine diseases demonstrating that the expanded cag repeat rna interacts directly with nucleolin and that this interaction triggers a number of aberrant downstream cellular processes eventually leading to cell apoptosis . collectively several mechanisms of rna toxicity have been revealed that may likely participate in the pathogenesis of polyq diseases however the entire scale of toxic rna contribution to the disorders and the range of cellular processes and pathways altered by mutant transcripts remain unknown . various genetic models have been used to demonstrate the first examples of cag repeat rna toxicity described in the previous section . although more relevant and potentially more informative than the fly systems transgenic mouse models have less frequently been used and human cellular models have been used for this purpose only twice.table 1characteristics of model systems used for the

express the cag repeat mutation within the sequence context of the entire human gene with sufficient upstream and downstream regulatory sequences to ensure the proper spatial and temporal expression of the human gene at natural levels 72 76 . a serious difficulty in identifying the involvement of rna toxicity in polyq diseases is the overlap with the polyq toxicity in models expressing cag repeats from the orf and placing the repeat in the untranslated sequence of a heterologous gene is frequently used to overcome this difficulty and trace the effects of mutant rna . however preventing transcript translation by the mutation of the start codon in a polyq disease gene or its cdna resolves this problem while preserving the natural sequence context and expression level for the repeats . with these in vitro and in vivo models critical experiments using both transcriptome wide and more focused candidate approaches have to be done to obtain clear cut answers regarding the role of mutant transcripts in the pathogenesis of polyq diseases.fig . 2four types of models that can be used to separate rna toxicity and protein toxicity in the investigation of the pathogenesis of cag repeat

expanded cag repeat containing transcript and a polyq containing protein are marked in red a transcript containing expanded caa repeats presumed to be nontoxic is marked in blue research on rna toxicity in polyq diseases is still in its infancy . nevertheless most of the genetic models provided in table 1 have succeeded in demonstrating the first examples of rna toxicity caused by expanded cag repeats . the studies performed thus far have revealed the involvement of several cellular processes and pathways in cag repeat rna toxicity . finally depending on the scale and repeat length thresholds for the various pathogenic mechanisms triggered by mutant rna these factors may impact the causative therapeutic approaches to combat polyq diseases to a higher or lower extent .", " the move was prompted by the failure of prowess shock a large international study to confirm the benefit reported from the original trial prowess protein c worldwide evaluation in severe sepsis 10 years ago . most drugs are approved after two positive phase 3 trials but exceptions are made when there are impressive supporting data there is a compelling unmet clinical need or the trial results are particularly impressive . so while we might lament that a sepsis drug was one of the unlucky ones the fundamental drug approval process that led to drotrecogin approval does not seem too lenient wrong or unreasonable . that said it is a shame that prowess was stopped early something outside the control of the fda as early stopping biases toward an overestimate of treatment effect . thus we now have an original trial suggesting benefit in both low and high severity risk with a constant relative risk reduction but variable absolute reduction and two subsequent trials mimicking the low and high ends of the original trial but failed to repeat the positive findings . if the combined estimate from the literature is say a non significant 2 to 3 reduction in mortality would we be interested in confirming whether such an effect was significant that would normally depend on the cost of one more much larger confirmatory trial our desire to tolerate non fatal bleeding side effects and the resulting financial impact both per patient cost effectiveness and global increase in spending of adopting the drug should the benefit be confirmed . eli lilly and company no doubt considered the potentially very large cost of another trial the fact that regulatory agencies and the field of critical care might be so skeptical as to threaten the ability to conduct another trial or adopt its results into practice or both and the likelihood that the trial would be negative . whether the action of eli lilly and company has left a drug that could cut sepsis mortality by 2 to 3 on the table is something we will now likely never know . our ability to make wiser choices about drugs would be enhanced if we could conduct larger trials more rapidly . the author gratefully acknowledges shamly

caused by brushing of acrylic resin denture bases polymerized by different methods may result in mass loss surface roughness loss of surface polishing problems on denture adaptation due the loss of surface details and difficulty on the maintenance of denture hygiene7212227 . investigating the abrasion resistance of different denture resins together with the abrasiveness of different dentifrices is of clinical interest to help selecting the most appropriate materials and methods for denture cleansing with no significant damage to the denture base . the aim of this study was to evaluate the mass loss of four commercially available heat polymerized acrylic resins after simulated toothbrushing with three different dentifrices . the tested null hypothesis was that different denture resins and dentifrices produce different mass loss after toothbrushing . the acrylic resins and dentifrices used in this study are presented in tables 1 and 2 respectively . in group 1 control the specimens were brushed with distilled water in group 2 the specimens were brushed with a dentifrice indicated for natural teeth colgate in groups 3 and 4 the specimens were brushed with dentifrices specific for complete dentures bonyplus and dentu creme respectively . the specimens were subjected to a linear toothbrush abrasion movement with a rate of 356 brush strokes forth and back per minute totalizing 35600 brush strokes for each specimen which is representative of 2 years of denture cleansing13 . it is thus important to evaluate the abrasion resistance to brushing of heat polymerized acrylic resins used for fabrication of denture bases . this confirms the importance of the abrasive agent s particles form size and distribution on the abrasive capacity of dentifrices412 . some studies have demonstrated the importance of dentifrice abrasiveness on promoting an efficient cleansing because brushing with water alone does not remove stains and organic deposits from dentures1314 . during the brushing procedure the specimens were kept immersed in dentifrice slurry for 100 min and some water sorption could occur . an important question concerns the clinical relevance of the abrasion produced by dentifrices on dentures . based on the obtained results and within the limitations of an in vitro study it may be concluded that differences exist among heat polymerized acrylic resins concerning abrasion resistance and that dentifrices specific for denture cleansing tend to cause less damage to acrylic resin surface .", " for these reasons the dkk1lrp6 interaction can be considered as a potentially interesting therapeutic intervention point and dkk1 a potential drug target for the treatment of bone and neurodegenerative disorders . a small molecule nci8642 has been described as an inhibitor of the interaction between dkk1 and one of its receptors lrp5 as well as an inhibitor of dkk1 activity in reducing wntcatenin signaling activation . each batch of dkk1 cm was functionally titrated in order to determine the volume of cm that gives about 50 inhibition of wnt signaling . for binding and kinetic assays dkk1 rd systems diluted in hbs ep at concentration ranging from 3 to 54 nm was injected for 180 sec at the flow rate of 20 l min over lrp6 either directly immobilized or captured via protein a as described before . for inhibition analysis dkk1 54 nm diluted in hbs ep buffer ph 7.4 was incubated with nci8642 at concentration from 5 to 20 m . in order to determine if nci8642 was also able to disrupt the binding of dkk1 to lrp6 a recombinant hek293 cell line stably expressing lrp6 was generated hek293lrp6 . when conditioned medium cm containing dkk1 was incubated on cells expressing lrp6 and the cell bound dkk1 was detected by immunofluorescence a strong membrane signal was observed in hek293lrp6 cells figure 1a panel b while it was almost absent on the parental hek293 cells figure 1a panel a . when dkk1 cm was supplemented with 100 m nci8642 the binding of dkk1 figure 1a panel d was reduced compared to the dmso treated control figure 1a panel c . in order to obtain a quantitative measure of the dkk1lrp6 interaction a construct coding for human dkk1 fused to a secreted domain of alkaline phosphatase was generated ap dkk1 and used to establish a stable hek293 cell line secreting ap dkk1 in the culture medium . the ap tag at the c terminus does not impair dkk1 binding to lrp6 as shown by immunofluorescence of cell bound ap dkk1 on hek293lrp6 figure 1a panels e and f . the binding of ap dkk1 to hek293lrp6 quantified by enzymatic ap assay was reduced when ap dkk1 was incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of nci8642 . the binding of dkk1 was reduced in a concentration dependent manner compared to dmso sample figure 1b . the lrp6dkk1 interaction was also verified using recombinant dkk1 cm instead of commercial recombinant dkk1 figure 2b . we also analyzed the effect of nci8642 on the binding of dkk1 to lrp6 to determine whether the compound could interfere with the interaction between dkk1 and lrp6 . when dkk1 was injected together with nci8642 after 1hour incubation at 25c we observed a consistent reduction of dkk1 binding on lrp6 with 5 m and 10 m compound and even a complete binding inhibition at the concentration of 20 m figures 2d and 2eupper panel . on the contrary sequential injections of 20 m nci8642 and 54 nm dkk1 did not inhibit the dkk1lrp6 interaction . nci8642 was not able to displace dkk1 when injected after it and dkk1 could still bind to lrp6 when injected after nci8642 at the concentration of 20 m figure 2emiddle and lower panels . for the purpose of compound testing the dilution factor of dkk1 cm was chosen in order to have about 50 inhibition of wnt signaling figure 3b open symbols . when nci8642 was added to the cells together with dkk1 and then the cells were stimulated with wnt3a the measured ic50 of the compound is 12.6 m pic50 4.9 stdev 0.2 n 5 independent measurements in good agreement with the binding data and the reporter assay figures 5a and 5b . recently the lrp5dkk1 interaction has been targeted with monoclonal anti dkk1 antibodies 39 40 . our study confirmed that nci8642 acts as a dkk1 inhibitor and we extended the finding to the interaction of dkk1 to lrp6 . in fact the small molecule caused the displacement of dkk1 from lrp6 overexpressed in hek293 cells as shown both by immunofluorescence and quantitative enzymatic assay . interestingly the compound was able to block dkk1 binding only when injected together with dkk1 and not when injected sequentially after dkk1 which is probably due to the high affinity of dkk1 for lrp6 compared with the micromolar affinity of nci8642 for lpr6 figures 2c and 2e . nci8642 is also functionally active in the inhibition of dkk1 activity on wnt signaling mediated by lrp56 as demonstrated by the tcf luc and catenin assays in two different cellular backgrounds . in fact nci8642 blocked dkk1 binding on lrp6 both in lrp6 overexpressing cells and in spr analysis .", " these interventions improve overall communication abilities but questions have been asked whether they

clinician and their participant partners . clinicians and participants were rotated during each day s session in order to provide a balance in communication partners . the treatment plan included identifying individual baseline linguistic strengths suggested hierarchy of most beneficial cues behaviors to constrain and specific linguistic targets or goals . from the second day onwards clinicians promoted individualized support with cues at a linguistic level suitable for each person and continued data tracking . if the other participants responded positively and the communicative exchange was successful clinicians were instructed not to correct communicative success is more important than the sentence accuracy . whenever clinicians were observed to manage cards for the participant this consistent with the current standards of care the no intervention group did not receive any specific treatment and the participants were asked to continue all previous activities as usual . after randomization sealed study charts containing all pre intervention testing results nat were funneled through the study biostatistician cjl to the therapists . all participants received nat which included 1 the boston naming test bnt 2 the controlled oral word association test 3 the semantic fluency test sft 4 the complex ideation subtest from the boston diagnostic aphasia examination bdae 5 the peabody picture vocabulary test iii ppvt iii and 6 the mini communicative activities log mini cal which is a subjective measure of communicative abilities . the study coordinators who were extensively trained in the use of these measures and blinded to group assignment administered the nat measures within 1 week prior to ciat and again during both the first week the twelfth week following ciat completion . the primary analysis used independent samples t tests to examine the differences in nat scores at each time point between the intervention and control groups and effect sizes and 95 confidence intervals the secondary analysis was an ad hoc analysis comparing the characteristics of patients who demonstrated a response or change in nat scores to patients who did not . there were 24 patients enrolled in the study 14 in the intervention group and 10 in the control group see consort diagram . patients who received ciat scored higher on the mini cal at 12 weeks after intervention compared to the control group mean 31 vs. 23 difference8 95 ci 1.3 to 13.5 p0.019 . there were 24 patients enrolled in the study 14 in the intervention group and 10 in the control group see consort diagram . finally a significant improvement was noted in the mini cal results for the ciat group compared to controls . this indicates that at least subjectively the patients in ciat group perceived more improvement over time than participants in the control group . only in the original study were participants randomized to treatment group however unlike the current study the personnel collecting linguistic data were not blinded to treatment assignment in any of these studies . and the results of the subsequent studies including ours the questions of training intensity and social interactions between participants and participants and clinicians need to be considered both can contribute to improved communicative abilities via increased verbal communication practice . a future study enrolling a highly variable group of participants would require a sample size of only 62 per treatment group to show a significant advantage of ciat over passive observation . also the outcome measures should include measures of pre and post intervention discourse and assess changes in the severity of aphasia using e.g. modest improvements were noted in the ciat group on the collected objective tests that were not noted in the control group forming the basis for estimating effect sizes needed for a comprehensive study .", " this case is more unusual as the patient was a known case of recurrent patellar dislocation and presented with an atraumatic locked and vertically rotated patellar dislocation . a 14year old healthy male child with previous history of recurrent lateral dislocation of patella presented to accident emergency department with complaints of inability to walk or bear weight on his left lower limb after he spontaneously dislocated his patella while running on uneven ground . radiographs revealed a laterally displaced and vertically rotated patella along its long axis with the medial patellar edge locked and dipping into the lateral gutter . a case of locked patellar dislocation with vertical axis rotation was first described in literature by cooper in 1844 . locked vertical dislocation of patella is a rare entity and poses a therapeutic challenge in which closed reduction often requires a general anaesthetic or may require an open procedure . we report an unusual case of lateral recurrent dislocation of patella in a 14year old healthy child who presented with vertically rotated and locked patella without any history of trauma which required an open reduction along with proximal extensor apparatus realignment procedure . standard anteroposterior and lateral plain radiographs were taken which showed a laterally displaced and vertically rotated patella along its long axis with the medial patellar edge locked and dipping into the lateral gutter fig . a decision for open reduction the patella was found to be locked with its articular surface facing laterally and the medial edge of patella locked past the lateral femoral condyle and wedged into the lateral gutter . vertical patellar dislocations pose a therapeutic challenge to the orthopaedic surgeons and are difficult to reduce by closed methods . most of the patellar dislocations are seen with direct blow to the medial aspect of patella with knee in near extension or due to indirect force causing sudden contraction of quadriceps muscles while the knee is stretched in valgus and the tight quadriceps act as a bow string and prevents relocation . in this report we review a case of lateral dislocation of patella which is of interest in that it was vertically rotated locked dislocation of patella which was atraumatic i.e with no direct trauma to the patella in an individual with a history of recurrent dislocation of patella .", " importantly recent studies have found dysfunctions of iad are similar to other types of addictive disorders such as substance abuse disorders and pathological gambling 710 . people experiencing iad showed clinical features such as craving withdrawal and tolerance 7 8 increased impulsiveness and impaired cognitive performance in tasks involving risky decision making . as similar with the abnormalities in the dopaminergic neural system in individuals with substance related addiction the role of dopaminergic neural system in iad also has been elucidated in a few researches 1214 . in a recent study people with iad were found to have altered resting state glucose metabolism in several brain regions including the major dopamine projection areas such as the striatum and orbitofrontal region . in a positron emission tomography pet imaging study reduced levels of dopamine d2 receptor in subdivisions of the striatum including the bilateral dorsal caudate and right putamen were found in the individuals with iad . taken together these findings suggest that iad may also be partly due to impaired dopaminergic neural systems similar to substance related addiction . in the present study we used single photon emission tomography spect with the radiotracer tc trodat1 to investigate striatal dat density to identify potential presynaptic abnormalities in iad subjects compared to age matched healthy controls . as shown in figure 1 and table 1 dat expression level of striatum was significantly decreased in iad subjects . to develop effective methods for intervention and treatment of iad it will first require establishing a clear understanding of the underlying neurobiological mechanisms . we found that dat expression level of striatum was significantly decreased and the values of v w and ra of the corpus striatum in iad subjects were greatly reduced . the imaging results provided the direct viewing proof of altered availability of dat in brain of people with iad . taken together the reduced dats found in our study may indicate the neuropathologic damage to the dopaminergic neural system caused by iad . according to our knowledge this is the first imaging study to examine the abnormality of dat in the brain of iad subjects . the results from this study provide evidence that iad may induce significant dat losses in the brain and these findings suggest that iad is associated with dysfunctions in the dopaminergic brain systems and are consistent with previous reports in various types of addictions either with or without substances 2123 37 . our findings support the claim that iad may share similar neurobiological abnormalities with other addictive disorders .", " we describe a case of acute transient encephalopathy in a patient treated with ceftriaxonefor enteric fever infection . the patient was hospitalized and started on ceftriaxone 1 g iv daily and intravenous fluids . in fact the temporal association of the encephalopathy induction and resolution with ceftriaxone administration and withdrawal makes this antibiotic highly likely to be responsible for the encephalopathy . we describe a case of ceftriaxone induced acute reversible encephalopathy in a patient treated for enteric fever infection .", " therefore the present preliminary study investigated the effects of mld in subjects with psychological stress and greater relative right frontal eeg activation with mld expected to shift eeg patterns toward symmetry . the subjects included 52 university students chosen according to the following criteria 1 no history of mental illness 2 not currently taking any medication known to affect eeg signals and 3 no known heart or muscle related disease . eeg data were acquired for 5 min before and immediately following mld . mld generally caused an activation shift from the right hemisphere to the left hemisphere in all frontal electrode pairs analyzed in this study . in this preliminary study frontal lobe eeg activity patterns in response to mld of the neck were examined to better understand alpha wave processing in subjects with psychological stress . mld application acts as a very light stimulator against psychological stress we predicted that mld would be associated with frontal eeg asymmetry and state and specifically result in greater left frontal hemisphere activation in the alpha frequency band . recent studies have suggested that greater left sided anterior activation indexed by decreased alpha activity in the left hemisphere is associated with a higher degree of positive affectivity a feeling of well being and a reduction in anxiety28 32 . our results indicate that mld is associated with a significant increase in left sided anterior activation thus supporting our hypothesis that mld can attenuate frontal eeg asymmetry . firstly this study only examined the acute electrophysiological changes produced after mld in subjects with psychological stress . in conclusion our preliminary study showed that mld can significantly increase left sided anterior activation .", " an expanded group documentclass12ptminimal usepackageamsmath usepackagewasysym

.", " as in railway construction projects and scientific and military expeditions across malaria zones quinine was the mainstay of the campaign being used for both treatment and prevention . there was something else that drew his attention workers who had taken quinine regularly and had no symptoms in xerm were struck by malaria when they visited rio for a few days without taking the alkaloid . perfect contrast the workers who took quinine and the women children and other migrants almost as numerous as the workers who took no quinine and were totally attacked by malaria. it says that when exposed to the constant action of quinine over a more or less lengthy period of time the parasite became adaptation opportunity for the haematozoa as they fed on blood with different degrees of chemical richness. in a third explanatory hypothesis neiva highlights the relationship between non infected individuals and victims of relapses in a situation of homogeneous chemical richness supposing that the haematozoa got accustomed to the alkaloid when they encountered it in high concentrations throughout the whole man the resistant plasmodium races were formed by their cultivation in a quinine rich environment both in man and in vectors as such growing from gametes accustomed to living in media where quinine was always present the haematozoa in another cycle from ookinete to the final feeding that released the sporozoite in the bloodstream already continued to develop even in the presence of quinine . while this may not have been the first time such a phenomenon had been observed by tropical medicine it seems to have been the first theory in the scientific literature on malaria to explain it . from his experience in xerm neiva concluded that constant quinine administration amongst malarial population groups when it is not administered equally to all the inhabitants will give the haematozoa the means to acquire specific resistance to the point of splitting into different races. in other words he believed resistance to be a phenomenon which from a clinical perspective was manifested in the failure of quinine to cure patients but whose origin lay in the development of parasite strains resistant to the drug . there the director of the instituto de manguinhos noted that huge doses of quinine up to 3 g a day still failed to prevent malaria from breaking out amongst people working on the railway . some patients continued to contain parasites in their blood 24h after an intravenous dose of 6 g of the alkaloid despite noting this he did not make any progress in his theoretical formulations about this biological phenomenon which would go on to intrigue german researchers with broad experience in malaria prevention and treatment . he was journeying along the coast of south america as a ship s doctor on a vessel owned by the hamburg it is therefore more than likely that giemsa prowazek and rodenwaldt learnt of neiva s observations of quinine resistance in rio de janeiro s swampy lowlands before he systematised and published his findings in the first volume of memrias do instituto oswaldo cruz . in an article also published in 1910 they stated that they had been prepared for some quinine resistance in the malaria contracted in inland brazil but they had been taken aback by its strength . several colleagues wrote rodenwaldt in 1919 will still remember the time when a malaria diagnosis in the tropics or at home would somehow lift our spirits about the patient for we were certain we could help and promise a definite cure. the first form resulting from the repeated effect of quinine on the plasmodium was correlated to the prolonged use of the alkaloid in malaria treatment . this would partially explain the resistance seen in the cases from the amazon including the peruvian amazon where quinine had been used to fight malaria for centuries . according to werner research by gustav giemsa and heinrich schaumann had demonstrated that the level of alkaloid in human blood was too low for a new generation of resistant parasites to develop from the fertilisation of the insect . according to nocht 1919 the trypanosomes resistance to drugs was stable and was maintained after many passages while quinine resistance disappeared in plasmodia after prolonged interruption of medication in the same host . new theories emerged during the first world war where the havoc wreaked by malaria in the balkans turkey and syria made resistance to quinine a top priority . the action of quinine often left much to be desired both therapeutically and prophylactically wrote the army physician wilhelm hoffmann as he weighed up the impact of malaria on german troops . some doctors even defended the idea that in regions like macedonia albania or the taurus mountains there was a different form of malaria that could not be treated with quinine . certain authors suggested that many supposed cases of biological quinine resistance were not just down to human resistance and the inadequate use of the drug but also to the general state of the patients who suffered from malnutrition stress and fatigue because of the physical and emotional impact of the war . at the time of the war few german doctors were familiar with the clinical aspects of malaria and how to treat and prevent it because according to rodenwaldt having been eliminated from germany half a century ago except for small enclaves malaria was no more than a curiosity in medical teaching before the war. ultimately the war served as a great experimental field for malaria research and especially for evaluating the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of quinine. apart from the hypothesis that there was a specific form of the disease in the balkans and turkey other theories were also put forward to account for the failure of treatment or prevention using quinine . in a bid to make some sense of the arguments and opinions that abounded martin mayer distinguished two forms of resistance chininabstmpfung dulling or insensitivity to quinine due to factors within the patient s body that made the individual unresponsive to the alkaloid and chiningewhnung adaptation to quinine referring to what took place inside the parasite . gustav giemsa and joseph halberkann from the hamburg institute questioned these results the excretion of quinine did not prove that it had failed to exert any action against the parasite in the organism . the fact is that the parasite s or human organism s resistance to quinine involved complex issues that were beyond the grasp of medical science at the time . if before the war neiva and werner spoke of a property developed in the parasites during the war the phenomenon started to be related to the inefficacy of the alkaloid caused by incorrect prophylaxis organic factors like immunity the social resistance of troops ascribable to the drug s side effects and so on . in an attempt to avoid the ambiguity suggested by the word resistance martin mayer from the hamburg institute proposed a distinction between insensitivity to quinine referring to the patient s organism and quinine adaptation a characteristic developed by the parasite . repulsion theory proposed by julius morgenroth in 1917 was that quinine would build up inside erythrocytes and would there repel the parasites by chemostatic action preventing them from penetrating the cell . when it came to the life cycle of the plasmodium the process by which it resisted immune reactions and the effects of quinine remaining quiescent in the organism until the disease relapsed was still a mystery . in a chapter on malaria in the respected handbuch der tropenkrankheiten handbook on tropical diseases by carl mense published between 1917 and 1918 races in certain regions like brazil which could have existed previously or have developed in response to the overuse of the drug . ziemann had summarised the different explanations but had made no progress in developing a theory thereby corroborating nocht and mhlens statements that the abundant literature on malaria published after the war discussed specific problems concerning the epidemiology physiopathology treatment and prevention of the disease but failed to put forward any satisfactory solution for most of the enigmas the doctors on the front line had been faced with . however the idea that the parasite acquired resistance to the alkaloid during its life cycle in humans andor in mosquitoes and that it was able to transmit resistance to its offspring was refuted by ernst rodenwaldt who in 1919 wrote one of the most robust works on the subject presented as a thesis to the university of heidelberg . let us then examine the ideas he galvanised to explain the complex biological process by which the malaria parasites became resistant to quinine . upon reaching germany he decided to enrol at the medicine department of heidelberg university where he wrote a thesis about the question that had intrigued him since he had been in africa the resistance of the malaria plasmodium to quinine . in einfhrung in die experimentellen vererbungslehre introduction to the experimental doctrines of inheritance a book published in 1914 and re edited in 1919 baur mentions the resistance of the plasmodium to quinine . he did not see this property as being an inheritance of acquired modifications in this case as in others it is naturally far more reasonable to concede that isolated races of malaria parasites had differing resistances to quinine and that by treating an infected person with the drug a more resistant race that already existed was simply cultivated in the pure form . in this case as in others it is naturally far more reasonable to concede that isolated races of malaria parasites had differing resistances to quinine and that by treating an infected person with the drug a more resistant race that already existed was simply cultivated in the pure form . they both held that the parasite developed resistance to quinine over several generations maintaining or increasing its resistant features in its passage through mosquitoes . rodenwaldt believed that plasmodium strains that had different levels of susceptibility to quinine but the same physical features emerged spontaneously in nature . selection took place when quinine was used in too small quantities in regions where malaria was widespread and where the arrival of non immune people provoked more virulent forms of the disease . the incomplete prevention or cure of patients contributed to the development of chronic malaria as in the regions where growing resistance to quinine had been observed . this dependence of the selection of quinine resistant races on the greater or lesser efficacy of therapeutic treatments explained why the problem did not occur in regions like germany where malaria had been endemic for a long time or italy which had had a systematic process for fighting the disease for some time the main consequence of treatment in a country with doctors and where the people are used to the therapy until the disease is eradicated was that the selection of quinine resistant races was prevented because the use of high doses of quinine until the parasites were killed made it impossible for epidemic levels to be reached . the main consequence of treatment in a country with doctors and where the people are used to the therapy until the disease is eradicated was that the selection of quinine resistant races was prevented because the use of high doses of quinine until the parasites were killed made it impossible for epidemic levels to be reached . in the tropics selection did not take place because the native population had a degree of immunity to the disease and almost never took quinine while europeans were generally treated correctly . in the balkans and turkey the environment was war ravaged crossed by people who were physically and psychically weakened where troops came into contact with villages rife with chronic malaria and other diseases and where army doctors had little familiarity with treating malaria a key ingredient in view of the importance rodenwaldt gave to the correct administration of preventive and therapeutic quinine in his theory . in 1919 in the archiv fr schiffs und tropen hygiene rodenwaldt published an article about the plasmodium s resistance to quinine . the material researched for this paper is not yet enough to analyse these discussions about the problem of quinine resistant malaria in any great depth . as a physician and hygiene adviser in turkey and syria schilling had observed several cases of malaria that showed resistance to mounting doses of quinine . according to schilling the conditions that neiva nocht werner mhlens and others have presented as being propitious for the development of quinine resistant races are valid . the conditions that neiva nocht werner mhlens and others have presented as being propitious for the development of quinine resistant races are valid . later in 1921 schilling modified his view slightly bringing it more into line with rodenwaldt s i have reached the idea of parasite races that are resistant to quinine by practical means in a severely affected population which received an unreliable supply of the alkaloid with the process observed not being due to developed and inherited resistance but rather to selection and increased virulence especially in more lethal and resistant parasite strains . i have reached the idea of parasite races that are resistant to quinine by practical means in a severely affected population which received an unreliable supply of the alkaloid with the process observed not being due to developed and inherited resistance but rather to selection and increased virulence especially in more lethal and resistant parasite strains . in this study we show that quinine resistance was already recorded in the early decades of the twentieth century in some regions of brazil giving rise to different theories to explain it . the theory of the development of quinine resistant races of the plasmodium put forward by arthur neiva would appear to be the first scientific work in the literature about malaria that attempted to give an explanation for the persistence of the disease even when the alkaloid was taken in ever higher doses . meanwhile in brazil the supremacy of preventive approaches which focused primarily on the vector of malaria adopted in the campaigns started by the rockefeller foundation after the first world war put strategies designed to address the parasite and the preventive and therapeutic use of quinine on the back burner . neiva s observations about the malaria parasite s resistance to quinine reveal the interdependency between laboratory and field work in overcoming public health problems and producing new knowledge about tropical diseases . according to leo slater by different routes from those of neiva and other tropical medicine specialists researchers working on new drugs for malaria did their best to reconstitute the complex connections between parasite host and vector in the laboratory . as had been the case when the theory of quinine resistance had been formulated it was also in a campaign to fight malaria in itatinga in 1905 that chagas formulated his hypothesis about domestic infection by anophelines which would be called on years later to support the campaign to kill malaria vectors by using ddt inside homes . just as it had been propitious for the study of quinine resistance the exchange between brazil and germany contributed to the communication of the discovery of chagas disease . according to neiva one of the factors that exacerbated malaria amongst these population groups was the incorrect use of quinine which was sold mainly in the form of a sulphate that was effective neither for prevention nor for treatment . in a letter he wrote in 1935 to a fellow public health expert he criticised the aggressiveness with which the german pharmaceuticals industry was marketing its new antimalarial agents i am sure that quinine will valiantly withstand all these tests but responsible work must be done under strict scientific determinism and these new products manufactured by german laboratories after experiments using bird haematozoa and launched on the market under treacherous commercial conditions must be kept at bay . in a text written with bernhard nocht mhlens did admit that the malaria parasite may come to develop resistance to plasmoquine analogous to the so called quinine resistance but went on to say that the veracity of this hypothesis remains for the present a debatable point. a publication from the following year shows that he saw resistance differently from neiva and rodenwaldt which suggests that the latters hypotheses had not left the theoretical realm my personal views on the matter have always been that the apparent resistance to medicine was less a characteristic of the parasite itself or even of certain strains of parasites than of the infected individual in whom it represented a lowering of the protective powers of the organism . in a chapter on malaria in the renowned clinical medicine handbook edited by klemperer he claimed that many cases of tropical malaria caused by p. falciparum were found to be resistant to treatment using drugs because the treatment was inadequate this is why during the war and in the following years so much was said about the malaria parasites resistance to quinine. as shown by christoph gradmann with regard to trypanosomes and arsenic compounds the analysis of quinine resistance on the part of the plasmodium shows that this became an object of investigation far before the phenomenon gained the full attention of the medical community because of bacterial resistance to antibiotics starting in the 1960s . but unlike gradmann s findings concerning trypanosomes the plasmodium s resistance to quinine was closely related to the frequency with which it occurred as a clinical phenomenon . nevertheless from the 1950s onwards the drug that drew specialists attention when it came to resistance was not quinine but chloroquine the most widely used drug in malaria treatment since its development . and yet echoes of these authors deductions can be heard in the way researchers currently address the plasmodium s resistance to chloroquine and other drugs population movements induce the introduction of resistant parasite strains while the widespread large scale use of the drugs operates as a selective pressure in that it removes populations of susceptible protozoa and maintains the resistant ones . the study of the historical records about the resistance of the malaria parasite to quinine demonstrates how important the research into the topic was to individual careers and to the formation of collective ideas which despite being involved in international research programmes followed national styles in the way they studied and fought the disease a prototypical tropical disease", " in advanced disease which constitutes about 75 of women at presentation this has been the approach for some decades though the 5year survival remains poor at about 40 . results in terms of overall survival os and progression free survival pfs were evaluated in each study . the premise for considering the potential impact of reducing intra abdominal tumour burden was based on the findings of work by magrath et al . a subsequent small prospective study on a heterogeneous population of patients who underwent aggressive radical surgery also revealed the better survival pattern associated with less tumour burden . the question as to whether the surgical ability of the operator or the inherent tumour biology of the disease is the main factor impacting on survival remains a debate . the gynaecologic oncology group gog currently defines optimal cytoreduction as leaving residual disease less than 1 cm in maximum tumour diameter . found a 5.5percent increase in median survival for every 10percent increase in the proportion of patients achieving maximal cytoreduction . noticed that secondary cytoreduction could also improve survival subsequently the role of interval debulking surgery ids has been investigated in three prospective randomized controlled trials rcts 57 where conclusions are different . the study by redman was closed prematurely as no survival benefit was noted at interim analysis and of note optimum debulking was defined as 2 cms residium compared with 1 cms in the other studies . a secondary attempt at cytoreduction was not associated with an improvement in progression free survival pfs 12.5 versus 12.7 months or overall survival os 36.2 versus 35.7 months . indeed this is still the only prospective rct showing a survival benefit with debulking surgery . the number of patients with less than 5 cm of residual tumour following primary cytoreduction in the eortc trial was less than a third compared to 55 percent in the gog trial . divided patients into 2 groups to evaluate the place of surgery in the therapeutic sequence of care group 1 receiving upfront surgery and group 2 where first debulking was undertaken after chemotherapy . found in a population of patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma where resectability was not possible that neoadjuvant chemotherapy helped to select patients for feasible and relatively less aggressive ids thus preventing initial surgical failure in terms of optimal debulking . in the period from 1980 to 1988 optimal primary cytoreduction 0.5 cm residual disease was achieved in 82 of cases but patients with stage iv disease or a metastatic tumour load of 1 kg prior to this procedure had poorer survival with high postoperative mortality 6 . this subsequent management improved overall survival despite a reduction of 25 in the rate of primary debulking . survival benefit was clear for patients with optimum secondary cytoreductive surgery followed by chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone at the time of recurrence .", " to the best of our knowledge this is the second report of a rare presentation of lch in the limbus which recurred after excision of the primary mass . unifocal involvement is the most common presentation of lch and the bone is the most frequently affected tissue.1 ocular involvement can be observed in 1 to 20 of lch cases.2 the condition may primarily involve the orbit eyelid epibulbar conjunctiva cornea iris vitreous choroid and optic nerve or secondarily infiltrate ocular tissues from surrounding structures.34 intraocular involvement by lch has rarely been reported in letterer siwe disease.5 the orbit is usually involved with unifocal lch which has a distinct tendency for the superotemporal bone at the rim of the orbit.6 the limbus can rarely be involved in unifocal lch presenting clinically as an infiltrative solitary limbal nodule which may be misdiagnosed as amyloidosis fibrous histiocytoma lymphoma and juvenile xanthogranuloma.27 the diagnosis of lch is based on characteristic histopathological features . electron microscopy may also assist the diagnosis by demonstrating intracytoplasmic inclusions named birbeck granules.1 the natural course of untreated lch varies from progressive and fatal systemic disease to localized self limited lesions.8 local resection for unifocal involvement and systemic chemotherapy for extensive multifocal lesions have been proposed as treatment modalities in lch9 however spontaneous regression has been reported in some unifocal lch cases.1 herein we report a case of unifocal lch presenting as an unusual limbal lesion which recurred after primary excision . systemic chemotherapy may be indicated for extensive multifocal and systemic lesions.19 to the best of our knowledge after the report by saxena et al2 our patient is the second case of unifocal limbal lch presenting as a recurrent solitary vascularized nodule . differential diagnoses for limbocorneal lch include dermoid amyloidosis fibrous histiocytoma and juvenile xanthogranuloma.2 in our case a limbal papilloma was the initial clinical diagnosis which should be added to this list . there is only a single case report of limbal lch in which the patient remained asymptomatic for a while after complete excision of the primary lesion but the tumor recurred 15 months afterwards.27 based on clinical and histopathological evaluations the recurrent tumor partially responded to combination chemotherapy and the patient was clinically stable for 5.5 years.7 in our case recurrence developed 10 months after resection of the primary lesion for which repeat resection together with corneoscleral patch grafting were performed and the patient has been tumor free up to 4 months .", " ophthalmological examination revealed right upper lid edema with a

in 2000 according to tnm stage log rank test p 0.001 the study may have been underpowered for detection of an assumed difference between patients with a lymph node harvest of 12 lymph nodes and those with 12 . in a population based study from the netherlands by kelder and co workers the median lymph node harvest was six and in only 21 of the specimens were 12 or more nodes examined . in the univariate analysis one of the hospitals achieved a significantly better survival with a harvest of more than 12 lymph nodes . however no significant survival benefit was found with harvest of more than 12 lymph nodes in the multivariate analysis . in a recent study the pathologist was found to be the dependent factor in lymph node harvest in multivariate analysis not the operating surgeon . the overall poor lymph node harvest may also indicate that more extensive surgery is one way to improve outcome as found in one of the hospitals . it may be speculated that the poorer outcome in the other two hospitals may have levelled out any benefit by an improved lymph node harvest i.e. although some authors 14 18 have concluded with stage migration as an explanation for an increased survival benefit other studies have shown that detection of positive nodes beyond six or seven lymph nodes examined had no effect on staging 19 23 . 26 27 the prognostic effect of lnr did not depend on the total number of lymph nodes nor on the number of positive nodes . found that lnr was not a significant prognostic indicator with less than ten examined nodes but became highly significant for os and disease free survival with more than ten lymph nodes harvested . a mayo clinic study found a positive correlation between the number of positive lymph nodes and survival but did not analyze the effect of lnr . fifty eight percent of our stage iii patients had less than 12 lymph nodes examined . a study from new zealand found that both the absolute number of lymph nodes retrieved up to 16 as well as the lnr were important for prognosis . only 41 had a lymph node harvest of 12 or more lymph nodes and although this influenced os in one hospital it did not overall . more radical surgery may increase the lymph node yield but if this has the potential to increase overall survival in our patients remains to be seen in the prospective registry .", " these studies provided evidence of clinically meaningful antitumor activity that is not seen with chemotherapy and ultimately supported the us food and drug administration s fda approval of vandetanib and cabozantinib for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer mtc and more recently sorafenib and lenvatinib for progressive radioiodine refractory ptc and ftc . this article aims to critically review the data on antitumor activity toxicity and potential patient selection tools for the newly approved multikinase inhibitor lenvatinib.9 a better understanding of the molecular biology of malignancies and the advent of targeted therapies represented an unprecedented development in the therapy of several solid tumors in recent years including non small cell lung cancer breast cancer melanoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.1013 a comprehensive genetic analysis of 496 samples of ptc as part of the cancer genome atlas tcga project showed that driver genomic alterations were found i97 of cases.14 the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor vegfr was one of the first signaling pathways to be associated with the aggressiveness of thyroid cancer.1517 despite its key role in the pathophysiology of thyroid malignancies other signaling pathways drive the thyroid cancer cell behavior . lenvatinib is a tki that targets vegfr13 fgfr14 pdgfr ret and c kit.3235 preclinical evidence indicates that lenvatinib inhibits tumor growth tumor induced angiogenesis cell migration and invasion in various human thyroid cancer xenograft and in vitro models.3637 compared to the other multikinase inhibitors tested in patients with differentiated thyroid tumors lenvatinib is particularly active against the fgfr family of tyrosine kinase receptors table 2 . in a dose escalation 3 3 phase i trial the maximum tolerated dose mtd of lenvatinib was investigated among a wide range of doses 0.520 mg twice daily in solid tumors including colon sarcoma and non small cell lung cancers.43 dose limiting toxicities of grade 3 elevations of aspartate and alanine aminotransferases and thrombocytopenia were observed at the 20 mg twice daily dose level . of note five patients experienced six serious aes related or possibly related to the study drug.43 a larger phase i trial investigated the safety and efficacy of lenvatinib among 82 patients with advanced refractory solid tumors which included renal colorectal and pancreatic tumors . in the expanded mtd cohort of 25 mg n24 grade 3 hypertension occurred in three 13 patients and grade 3 proteinuria in two 8 patients.44 based on these phase i trial results a subsequent phase ii trial was conducted among 58 patients with differentiated radioiodine refractory thyroid cancer who were treated with lenvatinib at 24 mg daily . of note two patients died after serious aes one arterial hemorrhage and one cardiac arrest.45 in another cohort of patients lenvatinib was tested at the set dose of 24 mg daily in 59 patients with advanced mtc 44 of whom received prior anti vegfr therapy and 15 received prior chemotherapy.46 overall response rate orr was 36 and median pfs was 9 months . there were three deaths due to aes including respiratory arrest not otherwise specified respiratory failure and paraneoplastic syndrome not specified only the respiratory failure related death was deemed to be treatment related by the treating physicians.46 in the seminal phase iii study select a total of 392 patients with radioactive iodine resistant progressive thyroid carcinomas of follicular origin defined as progression within the previous 13 months according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors the presence of one measurable lesion without radioiodine uptake on any iodine scan or disease progression within 12 months of radioiodine therapy were randomized to either lenvatinib n261 or placebo n131.47 a significant improvement in the median pfs the primary end point was documented among patients treated with lenvatinib compared to placebo 18.3 vs 3.6 months hr 0.21 99 ci 0.140.31 p0.001 with an unprecedented response rate of 64.8 . despite the previous use of targeted therapies lenvatinib also significantly improved the pfs in this subgroup of patients 15.1 vs 3.6 months hr 0.22 95 ci 0.120.41 and increased response rates 62.1 vs. 3.7 .48 complete radiologic responses were seen in four patients and prolonged stable disease longer than 23 weeks was noted in 39 patients treated with lenvatinib . of note hypertension was the most common grade 3 or higher toxicity affecting 42 of the patients in the select trial while observed in only 710 of the patients in the phase ii trials.4546 all grade hypertension occurred in up to 67 of the patients treated with lenvatinib select and it led to dose reductions or interruptions in up to 20 of the patients . these results are in agreement with the risk of fatal bleeding documented with other tyrosine kinase inhibitors and highlight the importance of careful monitoring.56 the clinically meaningful benefit in pfs and tumor response rate in this disease setting led to the us fda s approval of lenvatinib in february 2015 for the treatment of progressive thyroid cancer . improved os was identified in patients older than 65 years median 71 years when treated with lenvatinib.67 at this juncture the antitumor activity of lenvatinib including its improvement in pfs among patients with advanced progressive thyroid carcinomas of follicular origin supports its clinical use . the benefit of lenvatinib was not mitigated by prior multikinase treatment.48 one could hypothesize that the remarkable antitumor activity of lenvatinib is due to its tyrosine kinase inhibition of fgfr.19 fgfr family activation leads to upregulation of the ras mapk and pi3k akt signaling pathways.70 fgfr overexpression and phosphorylation observed in preclinical studies suggest that fgfr is an important signaling pathway in the thyroid tumors of follicular origin as reviewed earlier.19 despite its efficacy the toxicity of lenvatinib merits cautious consideration . up to 6571 of the patients treated with lenvatinib experienced grade 3 or higher toxicities having warranted dose reductions andor delays in the majority of the patients in previous phase ii and iii clinical trials table 3.4547 the pattern of disease progression in radioiodine refractory thyroid tumor should also be considered at the time of therapy initiation median pfs in placebo treated groups range from 3.65.8 months to the extent that asymptomatic patients may take months to meet criteria for disease progression . lenvatinib should be initiated at the time of rapid radiological clinical disease progression and in the setting of symptomatic tumor burden . it has been suggested that aes such as worst grade proteinuria correlated with lenvatinib antitumor activity in a small phase i dose escalation clinical trial.84 to our knowledge no stratified analysis of the efficacy of lenvatinib by toxicity has been reported . data are not yet available on the efficacy of dose reduced treatment of advanced thyroid cancer with lenvatinib . the results of the expanded cohort program with lenvatinib for the treatment of radioiodine refractory dtc with three different doses 24 20 and 14 mg daily will shed light into this important question nct02211222.88 in conclusion lenvatinib is a novel multikinase inhibitor that demonstrates significant responses and pfs benefit in the treatment of radioiodine refractory dtc . consistent with the current 2015 american thyroid association and the national comprehensive cancer network guidelines lenvatinib should be considered as the first line therapy in the setting of clinically relevant disease progression andor symptomatic disease burden in the setting of radioiodine refractory disease with the warning that physicians should be fully cognizant of its side effect profile including potentially fatal toxicities figure 1.6869 aggressive monitoring and guideline based management of toxicities similar to those utilized with other tkis should be enforced to prevent decline in quality of life.8991 future studies should endeavor to establish biomarkers predictive of toxicity and efficacy of lenvatinib treatment in radioiodine refractory thyroid tumors .", " stroke patients mainly experience motor disorders and degeneration of balancing ability due to unbalanced posture this is caused by asymmetric arrangement and hemiplegia and this disrupts independent activities of daily

aquatic pnf effectively affected the balance of stroke patients . these results indicate that aquatic pnf lower extremity patterns help enhance the balance of stroke patients . aquatic pnf promotes the maximum usage of muscle fibers due to the intense circumstances caused by buoyancy and turbulence moreover the water acts as a form of resistance stimulating proprioception and thus helping to improve postural control and balance8 13 14 . future research should address these things when investigating the effect of aquatic pnf lower extremity patterns in stroke patients .", " by reason of its different reagent composition the quick technique is sensitive to the coagulation factors fibrinogen ii v vii and x while the owren technique is affected by deficiencies in factors ii vii and x. the quick method measures factor v and fibrinogen which are not dependent on warfarin therapy and this constitutes a drawback for oat . the liver excretes both active and inactive coagulation factors to the plasma and both affect international normalized ratio inr measurement which possibly has escaped notice in the world health organization who recommendation for the prothrombin time methodology . the use of the inr system still involves difficulties with sample citrate concentration different reagents and thromboplastins and instruments and with isi and local isi calibration to harmonize results . this alternative means of determining the isi involves the use of freshly pooled plasmas from 20 normal individuals and 60 patients receiving coumarin oat . poller and colleagues european concerted action on anticoagulation ecaa have compared local isi calibration and direct inr in the correction for locally reported inrs . for local inr correction harmonization it is clear that plasmas from patients on warfarin therapy always involve varying amounts of inactive coagulation factors depending on the level of anticoagulation and individual patient characteristics see section on warfarin . all these former calibration models involve the principle that the calibrator contains an average amount of inactive coagulation factors inhibition which means an average correction for patient inr results . is the average correction of inactive coagulation factors appropriate for individual patient samples in a measuring range from 1 to 5 inr is it a fact that calibrators according to biochemical principles contain inactive coagulation factors inhibition do different reagents behave identically to active and inactive coagulation factors in our earlier studies we measured inactive coagulation factors inhibition in four different kits and noted conspicuous variation in inhibition . in principle today the quick and owren pt methods measure the sum of active coagulation factors fii fvii fx and inhibition by their inactive coagulation factor counterparts . the new generation pt method can measure separately both active coagulation factors fii fvii fx and the inhibition caused by inactive or partially inactive coagulation factors . different reagents and thromboplastins react variably with inactive coagulation factors and cause difficulties in calibration using patient plasmas that contain inhibiting coagulation factors . today s measuring principle is taking the sum of active coagulation factors fii fvii fx and inhibition of inactive coagulation factors is not a satisfactory approach from the standpoint of accurate patient care . the new generation pt offers possibilities of more accurate inr results and patient care based on control of active coagulation factors . the therapeutic inr ranges guiding anticoagulant therapy using old methods are based on the principle that both calibrators and patient samples have inactive coagulation factors inhibition on average which compensate for each other in the final inr result .", " patients may be stalled in suspended animation they are not alive in the sense the we enjoy life but neither are they able to die as long as nutrition hydration ventilation and perfusion are assured . in many cases reanimation of such patients this conundrum is created because we must be prepared to apply life sustaining technology to patients when the benefit appears to outweigh the risk and when there is a reasonable chance for an outcome that the patient would desire . however if organ system failure is not reversible then the reasoning behind life support technology becomes moot . we must then be prepared to remove supportive technology when it appears that inevitable death is being delayed rather than meaningful life prolonged . most rational surrogates are unwilling to continue life support after a reasonable trial has demonstrated that its benefit has passed the point of diminishing returns . however there is a continuing trend of surrogates demanding that moribund patients be kept on life support after prevailing medical opinions concur that there is no meaningful chance of reanimation . the notion of medical futility as an end stage process in which vital signs can not be supported further is poorly understood by both physicians and surrogates . therefore if a patient in a progressive inevitable death spiral is placed on mechanical ventilation it is not technically futile if vital signs are sustained however briefly . there is a population of icu patients who will die no matter what treatment is rendered them .", " urine protein electrophoresis showed an elevated total protein level and an elevated total albumin level . according to previous histopathologic reports on aosd we have experienced 45 patients with aosd in our hospital and so far found one case 2.2 associated with renal amyloidosis which had developed four years after the onset of aosd . when this complication occurs amyloid material is preferentially deposited in the glomeruli and proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome are the most common initial manifestations . amyloidosis was the most common finding in nephrotic syndrome . although either nsaid or an oral steroid is usually effective in aosd some patients with complications of the renal amyloidosis may require sustained therapy with corticosteroid and a cytotoxic agent . the col was also effective in a patient with severe ankylosing spondylitis and nephrotic syndrome due to amyloidosis . in review of 10 cases with aosd complicated by renal amyloidosis combined drug therapy with pd col ctx azathioprine and mtx were used . in conclusion although the mechanism of renal amyloid deposition is unknown early diagnosis and treatment with pd col ctx may produce excellent results .", " sudden unexpected death in epilepsy sudep is one of the most frequent causes of death among patients with epilepsy . there is strong evidence suggesting that sudden unexpected death in epilepsy sudep is a seizure related phenomenon . since then several cases have been reported in the literature presenting with a drop in heart rate or asystole during the seizure . according to a recent revised definition sudep consists of sudden unexpected witnessed or unwitnessed nontraumatic and nondrowning death in patients with epilepsy with or without evidence of a seizure excluding documented status epilepticus seizure duration 30 min or seizures without recovery in between and asphyxia if postmortem examination does not reveal a cause of death the diagnosis is definite sudep and if there is a preexisting condition before or after autopsy which could have contributed to the death it is classified as sudep plus . strong risk factors for sudep include young age early onset of seizures the presence of generalized tonic clonic seizures male sex and bedtime occurrence . furthermore in cases of epileptic cardiac dysrhythmia isolated eeg or ecg recording may prove insufficient and prolonged simultaneous eeg ecg monitoring may be required . attaining the correct diagnosis is essential because appropriate treatment may prevent cardiogenic sudep which is thought to be related to potentially lethal arrhythmias such as asystole induced by epileptic seizures and to prevent the cardiac side effects of specific antiepileptic drugs . in conclusion cardiological investigation should be included in epilepsy management to search for abnormalities of hr or ischemic events .", " evidence to support involvement of rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility in schizophrenia comes from both nongenetic and genetic studies performed on samples in which individuals with schizophrenia predominantly were born prior to 1970 15 19 47 6066 and reviewed in . collectively these studies have provided evidence that rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility is a risk factor for schizophrenia with relative risk ranging from 1.4 to 2.26 a magnitude that is comparable to the relative risk of schizophrenia due to obstetric complications in general or due to most genes for which an association with schizophrenia has been observed see 68 69 for reviews . it is remarkable that studies of rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility and schizophrenia that differ in design and population cohort should arrive at similar relative risk estimates this consistency suggests that the relative risk of schizophrenia due to rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility although small is substantively meaningful and worthy of more investigation . this variability in allele frequencies will not affect the relative risk of disease due to rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility but will affect the fraction of schizophrenia cases that are attributed to the rhd locus across populations . since most individuals who are exposed to rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility do not develop schizophrenia it is highly unlikely that exposure to this adverse prenatal environment alone that is a phenocopy model explains risk for schizophrenia . to date there have been no empirical studies to determine whether the association between rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility and schizophrenia is explained through a geneenvironment interaction model . there also is emerging evidence in studies based on serotype data and those based on genotype data that risk of schizophrenia due to rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility may depend on offspring sex 61 66 67 with a relative risk of 1.64 in male incompatible offspring and 1.07 in female incompatible offspring based on a recent meta analysis . furthermore a nonsignificant trend suggesting that male offspring are at higher risk than female offspring for schizophrenia due to maternal fetal genotype incompatibility at another rbc antigen locus abo has also been identified based on serotype data . thus one hypothesis is that specific schizophrenia effects of rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility hypoxia hyperbilirubinemia can affect female fetuses but that they are less likely to surpass the threshold of severity compared to male fetuses threshold effect . although there have not yet been studies addressing whether risk of schizophrenia due to rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility in male and female fetuses is a function of a threshold effect or a timing effect there have been studies addressing potential sex differences in rates of hypoxia related in males and females with conflicting results 79 80 . the involvement of the rhd gene in the form of maternal fetal genotype incompatibility as a risk factor for schizophrenia susceptibility is further substantiated by analyses that showed no evidence to support the idea that this locus is simply linked associated with a nearby schizophrenia susceptibility locus or that this gene acts through the maternal genotype alone . furthermore there is empirical evidence consistent with the hypothesized biological mechanism that previous rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatible pregnancies increase risk for maternal isoimmunization in subsequent pregnancies in the two schizophrenia rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility studies that tested this hypothesis 61 65 . however further examination of this hypothesis is warranted due to the findings that suggest that the risk of schizophrenia associated with rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility is limited to male offspring . the first candidate gene study to test the hypothesis of rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility as a risk factor for schizophrenia provided the proof of principle that this non mendelian mechanism can be tested with genotype data . because risk of schizophrenia is associated with prenatal obstetric complications including preeclampsia and low birth weight maternal fetal hla matching has been associated with these and other pregnancy obstetric complications maternal fetal hla matching has been observed in another neurodevelopmental disorder and maternal fetal hla matching may occur more frequently in families of individuals with schizophrenia for biological reasons a candidate gene study was conducted to assess maternal fetal genotype incompatibility that is matching at the hla a b and drb1 loci as a risk factor of schizophrenia . for this study palmer and colleagues hypothesized that maternal fetal genotype incompatibility increased risk of schizophrenia through a general allele matching phenomenon rather than through specific allele combinations . as this is the first study to demonstrate an association between hla b matching and schizophrenia much more research is needed to determine the mechanism through which this form of maternal fetal genotype incompatibility increases risk for schizophrenia . although the sex dependent finding is intriguing in light of the work demonstrating that rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility as a schizophrenia risk factor is limited to males replication and investigation of hypothesized clinical manifestations of hla b matching low birth weight preeclampsia other complications are warranted because other published studies reveal conflicting results regarding sex differences in the rates of low birth weight and preeclampsia among individuals with schizophrenia 102 104 . based on this review there are a variety of hypotheses that could be tested in future research to further elucidate the role of rhd and hla b maternal fetal genotype incompatibility in schizophrenia . one important area of research would focus on conducting studies that add to the evidence that these maternal fetal genotype incompatibilities are risk factors for schizophrenia . as examples since rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility is genetic in origin one would expect more clustering of schizophrenia in families with rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility than in schizophrenia families without rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility . if rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility is a risk factor specifically for males one would expect to observe that schizophrenia risk is associated with a birth order effect with male offspring exposed to rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility but not for female offspring . if hla b matching is involved specifically in predisposition to pre eclampsia one would expect to observe that schizophrenia risk is associated with a birth order effect with female offspring exposed to hla b maternal fetal genotype incompatibility but not for male offspring . a second area of research would focus on if how the maternal fetal genotype incompatibility integrates with genetic liability for schizophrenia phenocopy gene environment covariation and gene environment interaction . the phenocopy and gene environment covariation models are unlikely to explain the association between rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility and schizophrenia . if this is the case then one would expect different risks for schizophrenia based on family history and rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility with greatest risk of schizophrenia among genetically high risk individuals who are exposed to rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility . if the schizophrenia risk effect of rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility is the result of hypoxia then one would expect to observe smaller hippocampal volume in individuals with schizophrenia exposed to rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility compared to those not exposed . if the schizophrenia risk effect of rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility is the result of hypoxia then one would expect rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility to be associated with neurocognitive functions that may be sensitive to the effects of prenatal hypoxia in schizophrenia for example verbal learning and memory . a fourth area of research would focus on hypotheses to further examine offspring sex dependent differences in the schizophrenia producing effects of rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility . as one example the rhesus d negative allele is less common in african and asian populations than european caucasian populations 72 120 121 hence rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility is less likely to contribute to schizophrenia susceptibility in those populations . thus far the rhd abo and hla b genes have been implicated as risk factors for schizophrenia with increasing evidence that male and female offspring may be differentially vulnerable to the effects of maternal fetal genotype combinations involving these genes . thus these maternal fetal genotype incompatibilities are likely to be part of a complex mixture of factors genetic and environmental which together act on the brain in ways yet to be identified to result in schizophrenia . the empiric data demonstrating a relationship between these maternal fetal genotype incompatibilities and schizophrenia provide hypotheses for future investigations to further our understanding of their role in increasing risk of schizophrenia . until recently studies to understand the role of maternal fetal genotype incompatibility in schizophrenia or any complex disorder have inferred immunologically relevant genotypes solely from birth records and for the single phenomenon of hemolytic disease . as illustrated in this review maternal fetal genotype incompatibility at other loci such as hla loci may also increase risk for schizophrenia . there are several reasons why it is important to further investigate maternal fetal genotype incompatibly as a risk factor for schizophrenia 1 it is a new research approach that allows precise identification of a putative high risk prenatal environment even years after the adverse environment has occurred 2 using a genetic approach it is possible to simultaneously evaluate alternative explanations of allelic effects that act solely through the genotype of the mother or child 3 if certain maternal fetal genotype incompatibilities for example rhd do increase risk for schizophrenia then efforts could be launched to increase prevention of the effects of this class of risk factor 4 this approach could serve as a model for studying other complex disorders for which maternal fetal genotype incompatibilities may be involved for example diabetes 127 128 and rheumatoid arthritis 129131 .", " the statistical significance of the effect of sucralose on glucose insulin c peptide

0.0041 37902 100 . locations of gcts included 17 cases in the right ovary 47.2 15 in the left ovary 41.7 and one 2.8 in each of the bowel abdominal wall and omentum . only four 10.8 concurrent pathologies included leiomyoma of the uterus 21 benign cysts 14 adenomyosis 7 coexisting ovarian adenocarcinoma 3 and endometrial carcinoma 3 . a 14year 19972011 surgical pathology review yielded 37 cases of gct with an overall prevalence of 0.0041 37902 100 . locations of gcts included 17 cases in the right ovary 47.2 15 in the left ovary 41.7 and one 2.8 in each of the bowel abdominal wall and omentum . only four 10.8 concurrent pathologies included leiomyoma of the uterus 21 benign cysts 14 adenomyosis 7 coexisting ovarian adenocarcinoma 3 and endometrial carcinoma 3 . gcts are rare sex cord stromal tumors that are thought to arise from the normal proliferating granulosa cells of the late preovulatory follicle as they share many morphological and biochemical features with these cells . identification of normal and neoplastic gscs and the factors that regulate their behavior will determine the treatment of all ovarian cancers including gcts in the future . in men the typical clinical scenario of a gct is usually a middle aged female presenting with a pelvic mass who is cured by en bloc resection of the mass . these characteristics however are not generalizable to all gcts as these lesions can present in many different facets and have a tendency to behave unpredictably thus complicating both diagnosis and therapeutic management . accurate recognition of the true realities of multifaceted gct is therefore vital for the precise diagnosis and management of these lesions . this cancer can be divided into three types based on the cell of origin germ epithelial and stromal with each conferring different histopathological features and clinical outcomes . granulosa cell tumours gcts account for 1 2 of all ovarian tumours and arise from the granulosa cells that normally surround the oocytes and line the developing follicle . histologically testicular gct resembles ovarian presenting as a solid cystic mass with microfollicular gyriform insular and trabecular patterns . unlike agct jgct is considered by many to be a relatively benign tumour and in infantile males is the common type of sex cord stromal tumour of the testis . on radiologic imaging jgct is often indistinguishable from other ovarian neoplasms and identification of histopathology features such as a nodular diffuse cellular growth andor macrofollicules with eosinophilic basophilic fluid in their lumen is often required for correct diagnosis . on average microscopically these tumours are solid cellular with follicle formation edema and loose stroma . in addition gct is a vascular tumor that may occasionally rupture and result in abdominal pain hemoperitoneum and hypotension mimicking an ectopic pregnancy in younger patients . occasionally gcts and theca cell tumours have been found in ovaries which show no enlargement and are therefore clinically occult 35 36 . gcts are the most common estrogen producing neoplasms in females and are found to produce estradiol in approximately 4060 of patients . mullerian inhibitory substance mis which is produced in the developing follicles is often elevated in gcts though it is not specific for diagnosis 2 3 . serum mis levels thus correlate well with tumor presence in patients with gcts and elevated levels are considered highly specific for gct in postmenopausal or oophorectomized women . it may also be elevated in women with sertoli leydig cell tumors of the ovary but is not typically produced by other gonadal or extragonadal tumors . gcts have been reported in coexistence with a number of pathologies including mucinous cystadenoma 7 41 42 cystic teratoma ovarian fibroma ovarian angiosarcoma adenosarcoma cystadenosarcoma sclerosing peritonitis gastric signet ring cell carcinoma and cervical lipoleiomyoma . in the indexed case 4 gct was found to coexist with colonic adenocarcinoma as a unique collision tumor which has been discussed previously in detail . the presence of such coexiting pathologies may contribute to increased confusion and be a deterrent to the accurate clinical and pathological recognition of this uncommon neoplasm . uterine pathologies that have been reported to occur with gct include glandular hyperplasia atypical adenomatous hyperplasia adenocarcinoma insitu and invasive carcinoma . endometrial hyperplasia is a common finding alongside gct occurring in 2550 which may occur due to estrogen produced from the gct stimulating the endometrium . a simultaneous uterine carcinoma can be found in 510 of patients with gct and are often well differentiated and in an early stage . the mainstay treatment for gct is the same as for epithelial ovarian cancer that is surgical excision 6 20 27 . aside from being a treatment option surgery is also necessary for staging and accurate tissue diagnosis 3 27 . gcts are sex cord stromal neoplasms that on microscopic examination contain sex cord derived epithelial elements admixed with mesenchymal elements with a variety of combinations and degrees of differentiation . immunohistochemical analysis can be used to confirm the diagnosis of gcts if the lesion s morphology is non predictive of histogenesis . the absence of staining with ema has diagnostic value in distinguishing gct from its multiplicity of histological look alikes such as metastatic or primary carcinoma . a quarter of gct patients will have recurrences and the mean time to their detection is 510 years 3 27 . frequent sites of recurrence include the upper abdomen 5570 and the pelvis 3045 . approximately 80 of females with advanced gct die due to the disease which is partly related to the tendency for delayed recurrence . gct is best considered an unusual indolent neoplasm of low malignant potential with late recurrences that can arise in the ovaries and testicles in both the young and the old . however long term lifelong followup including physical pelvic exam abdominal pelvic ct scan andor tumor markers as available is recommended in all patients with gcts as delayed tumor recurrences beyond 5 years are characteristic of this disease .", " at the level of the oral cavity the lymphoproliferative disorder can occur in various ways most commonly as lymphoid lesions with extranodal externalization but sometimes oral lesions may represent a localization of a disease spread . under the key research that sees lymphoproliferative disorders associated with injury or events at the oral cavity the present paper proposes a comprehensive classification as listed in table 1 and deeply described below . even though each type of nhl can occur at the level of oral cavity the most common types are large cell lymphoma and lymphoma of small lymphocytes lymphoma mucosa associated lymphoid tissue malt lymphoma follicular lymphoma burkitt s lymphoma and immunocytoma immunoblastic lymphoma are also reported 8 11 12 . oral lesions may appear as exophytic neoplasms erythematous asymptomatic often with superficial ulcerations secondary to chronic trauma figure 1 . the oral manifestations by plasma cell tumors can occur in three different ways as a consequence of the local manifestation of multiple myeloma bone plasmacytoma as solitary or as extramedullary plasmacytoma . this disease accounts for 10 of all plasma cell tumors and can strike 25 27 28 although rarely in the oral cavity showing a predilection for the mandibular retromolar area its radiological appearance may have one of two patterns as either an oval shaped lytic image with destruction of the cortical bone or as a hyperinsufflating lesion showing a convex bicortical bone . other examples of oral lesions as first manifestation of lymphoproliferative disorders may be the infiltration of the oral mucosa by a b cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia the lymphomatous papulosis a condition mucocutaneous applicant self limited characterized by papular eruptions and mycosis fungoides t cell cutaneous lymphoma in which the involvement of the oral cavity is a rare event but well documented 63 64 . in addition to entering into this category the previously treated lymphoproliferative disorders where the diagnosis of oral lymphoid malignancy was subsequent to an indication of their early sign mentioned in this regard a clinical pathological entity of which we have evidence in the literature for over a century of mycosis fungoides mf chronic lymphoproliferative disorder with predominantly cutaneous involvement characterized by the proliferation of t lymphocytes that in advanced stages of the disease can accumulate also in lymphoid organs bone marrow and peripheral blood sezary syndrome . here is a list of non specific signs and symptoms present in association with lymphoproliferative disorders of the oral cavity lymphadenopathy trismus erythema epiphora pain swelling facial asymmetry or swelling of buccal mucosa sinusitis increased lacrimation and abscesses of the lacrimal sac diplopia nasal obstructions sepsis fever runny nose prosthetic instability headache and paresthesia idiopathic epistaxis . although oral lymphomas are extremely rare 68 69 they can occur earlier and be placed in the differential diagnosis with non specific inflammatory processes . oral lesions in paraneoplastic dm leucoerythroplasia and ulcerative lesions have rarely been described in the literature 7679 . in the literature there are numerous works reported that associate mucous membrane pemphigoid mmp with malignancies including lung cancer pancreatic adenocarcinoma gastric adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva there are only two cases reported of mmp with oral manifestations associated to lymphoproliferative disorders a b cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia . these are patients with lymphoproliferative disorders such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia which developed necrotic processes at the level of the oral cavity not associated with typical ulcer necrotizing periodontal diseases but by bacteria in the oral cavity unusually found as pseudomonas aeruginosa . patients with impaired lymphocyte function or reduced counts of neutrophils due to lymphoproliferative disorders have led to the acquisition of new infections andor exacerbation or reactivation of latent infection periapical periodontitis and herpes simplex . the origin of odontogenous infection of the pulp and periodontal is frequently observed in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders and should be suspected when orofacial pain extensive dental restorations and dental caries and periapical radiopacity occur 97 98 . xerostomia is often present in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders treated with radiotherapy in the head and neck region due to damage of the major salivary glands which are still included in the irradiation of tumors . patients treated for lymphoproliferative disorders are at increased risk of relapse of the primary disease so as to develop subsequent tumors both hematologic and nonhematologic in this regard we consider the oral squamous cell carcinoma as a second primary solid tumor after allogeneic transplant . patients treated for lymphoproliferative disorders are at increased risk of relapse of the primary disease so as to develop subsequent tumors both hematologic and nonhematologic in this regard we consider the oral squamous cell carcinoma as a second primary solid tumor after allogeneic transplant . with regard to the primary localizations of lymphoproliferative disorders a careful examination of the head and neck oral and oropharyngeal area is necessary in order to identify suspicious lesions and their early detection . numerous complications have been described and frequently found at oral level due to pathology or different therapeutic strategies .", " this global increase in the prevalence of diabetes will inevitably lead to increases in the prevalence of diabetic microvascular and macrovascular diseases and consequently significantly increased health care expenditure . type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with a high rate of complications related to cardiovascular disease and diabetic nephropathy retinopathy and neuropathy . in addition the prevalence of macrovascular complication was 10.8 from recent the korean national diabetes program kndp data and there is reference from 2005 korea national health and nutrition examination survey knhanes data in table 1 . microvascular complications are closely related to age duration of diabetes and glycemic control and this relationship is stronger than that with macrovascular complications . the case fatality rate after myocardial infarction is higher in patients with diabetes than in patients without diabetes . the association between diabetes and coronary heart disease is likely to become more important for two reasons . cardiovascular disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality for individuals with diabetes and is the largest contributor to the direct and indirect costs of diabetes . microvascular complications of diabetes increase the risk of cardiovascular events in diabetic patients . these data imply that the microvascular complications of diabetes are related indirectly to the macrovascular complications of diabetes similar in korea . intensive glycemic control has been suggested as an effective treatment for reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease and microvascular complications in people with diabetes . although there are many benefits of intensive glucose lowering treatment for preventing macrovascular and microvascular events it remains uncertain whether these benefits outweigh the risks . intensive blood glucose control decreases the risk of developing microvascular complications but not macrovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes . in the action to control cardiovascular risk in diabetes accord study an intensive glucose lowering regimen reduced rate of 5year nonfatal myocardial infarctions but was associated with a 22 increase in mortality . however multifactorial approaches in high risk patients with diabetes such as tight glucose regulation and the use of anti hypertensive medication aspirin and lipid lowering agents have been shown to reduce the risk of nonfatal cardiovascular disease among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria . the increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus and its related complications have contributed to a substantial increase in morbidity and mortality in korea .", " of the heart and other organs in their efforts to understand the complexity of organ function and of associated cellular and molecular biologies . moreover if there is no understanding of the mechanisms which the body uses to regulate its function and to recover from dysfunction or infection how can it be possible to assess whether a patient s recovery is due to a medicine medical procedure or to the natural processes of recovery modern medicine evolved from the growth of the chemical industry and the massive increase of chemical research which yielded chemicals of ever greater complexity and biological significance . this leads us to question basic assumptions upon which modern biomedicine is based e.g. many diseases are poorly defined and are often difficult to diagnose e.g. any medical assessment must take into account the level and conformation of the protein the level and conformation of the substrate and the factors which influence the rate at which the protein reacts with the substrate e.g. many diseases are poorly defined and are often difficult to diagnose e.g. any medical assessment must take into account the level and conformation of the protein the level and conformation of the substrate and the factors which influence the rate at which the protein reacts with the substrate e.g. a better understanding of how the body regulates its function would improve the understanding of the diagnostic or therapeutic scope of such technologies . the greater the amount of changes to the genetic structures the greater will be the scope for physiological and cognitive dysfunction . how can it deal with the daily causes of stress how does stress influence the body s function furthermore by ignoring phenotype it ignores up to 50 perhaps more of the disease creating processes . if it can incorporate an understanding of phenotype it may be able to deal with both the cause of a disease and its symptoms . they are indicative the mechanisms which the body uses to regulate its complex multi level function . it is the precise nature and co ordinated function of the physiological structures which determines the levels of each key systemic parameter ph temperature digestion elimination breathing blood pressure blood volume blood cell content blood glucose osmotic pressure sexual function posture and sleep . over time this progressively influences the stability of most if not all other physiological systems e.g. this autonomic instability leads to cellular and molecular changes and ultimately to what we know as pathologies . in particular it influences the expression of proteins and the rate at which such proteins subsequently react which can be measured . to provide more information which has the potential to advances the understanding of multi systemic etiologies e.g. of i protein expression ii the rate which expressed proteins subsequently react with their reactive substrates and iii which incorporates an understanding of the reaction conditions governing such reactions.to diagnose from presymptomatic origins . it contrasts with biomarker techniques which compare the analysed results with that of expected norms.to differentiate between normal and abnormal cell morphologies . indications of the changes taking place to cell morphology.growth of new cells or death of old cells . to provide more information which has the potential to advances the understanding of multi systemic etiologies e.g. to illustrate the influence of both genotype and phenotype upon each pathology i.e. to differentiate between normal and abnormal cell morphologies . increased or decreased cell function hyperfunction or hypofunction . to predict the onset of further pathologies .", " although the utility of ct for detection of chest injuries is primarily demonstrated in severely injured patients this widespread use deserves reconsideration because its effectiveness might not always outweigh potential harm by radiation exposure 4 5 medicalisation time loss and the high costs . these recommendations reflect that little evidence exists on which patients are likely to benefit from chest ct after blunt trauma . more importantly it remains unclear in which patients chest ct can be omitted without missing relevant injuries . the aim of this prospective study on adult blunt trauma patients is therefore to derive a set of independent clinical parameters that distinguish patients who will benefit from chest ct from patients in whom chest ct can be omitted without missing relevant injuries . two outcome measures were determined before this study started 1 presence of chest injuries on ct and 2 clinically relevant occult injuries . clinically relevant occult injuries were defined as injuries on ct that were not visualised by cr of the chest and thoracic spine and that had an impact on patient management . we selected dichotomous candidate predictors of injuries on ct based on a review of the literature and clinical experience . in

variables that predict whether ct of the chest including the thoracic spine is likely to reveal relevant injuries in high energy blunt trauma patients . however our study data also suggested that if our positive predictors were implemented as scanning indications 5 24508 of all patients with chest injuries on ct would not be identified . although cost effectiveness studies have established acceptable risks for cost effective injury detection by using ct 18 19 these unfortunately do not pertain to injuries of the entire chest including the thoracic spine . however these studies only investigated distinct chest or thoracic injuries and used a case control design 20 21 or did not use ct as a standard of reference 14 2224 . we investigated and described strong criteria that predict presence of any type of relevant chest injuries on ct . external validation is needed for three reasons the performance of our model is likely to be over optimistic the model was created in the same sample of patients in which the performance was determined and should therefore be evaluated in a new sample of trauma patients in our centre.external validation should furthermore be carried out to evaluate our model in other centres the definition of some clinically relevant injuries such as occult injuries for which the care level was upgraded or additional diagnostic work up was needed is institution and cliniciandependent.the costs effectiveness and impact on patient quality of life of ct in chest injury diagnosis should be further investigated . presence of any of these criteria can predict presence of chest injuries on ct with a sensitivity of 95 . although our findings need external validation a diagnostic algorithm employing these criteria has the potential to reduce unnecessary ct examinations of the chest in blunt trauma patients in the future .", " many different chemotherapy regimens were therefore developed.13 however little is known on the feasibility and efficiency of chemotherapy for these cancer types in patients with severe renal failure.46 only case reports on the pharmacology of irinotecan in patients with colon or rectal cancer are available at present.711 we present the first case of combination chemotherapy in metastatic gastroesophageal cancer in a dialysis patient . the drug was evaluated in patients with serum creatinin between 1.6 and 5 mg dl and no unexpected toxicities were seen.25 there are a number of case reports on the use of irinotecan during hemodialysis all of which are on patients with metastatic colon cancer . they noted however that these doses were only feasible in patients of korean descent.26 there is a very recent case report on the combination of irinotecan at a dose of 50 mg m weekly combined with fu1600 mg m24

oa.4 similarly the longitudinal cohort of motor system organ study reported that the prevalence of knee pain was 32.7 in the population and that it increased with age.5 it has been suggested that knee oa impairs locomotor functions because of the pain and the biomechanical mechanism of impaired locomotor functions such as walking speed and stride length in patients with knee oa has been investigated.67 glucosamine containing supplements have been used widely for improving knee pain in oa.89 in our previous studies we demonstrated that glucosamine containing supplements gcq or gcqid glucosamine hydrochloride chondroitin sulfate type ii collagen peptides quercetin glycosides imidazole peptides proteoglycan and vitamin d were effective for relieving knee pain andor locomotor functions in randomized placebo controlled trials.1011 the effects of thermal and exercise therapies on locomotor functions and their mechanism in patients with knee oa have been elucidated with biomechanical methods12 but the biomechanical mechanism of the effects of supplements such as gcqid on locomotor functions has not been reported . in the present study we used a motion capture system to investigate the biomechanical mechanism for the improving effects of gcqid on locomotor functions in subjects with knee pain . exclusion criteria were the same as in our previous study11 and typical reasons for exclusion were the following fast walking speed 1.6 m s presence of hyperuricemia diabetes cardiovascular disease hepatic disease renal disease or heart disease presence of rheumatoid arthritis that may cause joint pain surgical treatment of knee joints needed or undergone daily use of a cane daily or occasional vigorous exercise need for pharmacological articular treatments during the study period a history of osseous or articular diseases other than oa within the past 3 months routine use of health food or medicine that may affect the outcome of the study and

baseline using the steel test for jkom total score glfs5 score and questionnaires dunnett s test was used for the vas score for jkom knee pain normal walking speed and parameters measured by motion capture analysis . correlation analysis between changes in parameters analyzed by the motion capture system and locomotor functions that involve the knee joint over the 16week intervention period was conducted and pearson s correlation coefficient r value for parametric variables and spearman s rank correlation coefficient value for nonparametric variables were calculated . exclusion criteria were

analyzed by the motion capture system and locomotor functions that involve the knee joint over the 16week intervention period . the present study was conducted to investigate the biomechanical mechanism for gcqid s positive effects on locomotor functions in subjects with knee pain using a motion capture system . gcqid improved functions of locomotion that involve the knee joint as evidenced by jkom and glfs5 scores table 2 suggesting that gcqid supplementation exerted effects on knee pain in daily life and on qol in accordance with our previous study.11 the motion capture analysis revealed that gcqid simultaneously increased normal walking speed and stride and step length but that cadence was not changed table 3 . as the change in stride length at 16 weeks was correlated with the change in the angle of soles at the end of the stance phase r0.66 we considered that gcqid might increase stride length through enhanced driving power . because the change in stride length at 16 weeks was correlated with changes in jkom total score and glfs5 score 0.44 and 0.42 respectively gcqid might increase stride length through alleviated knee pain and improved functions of locomotor system in daily life . although improvement of scores for functions of locomotor system such as the jkom total score was comparatively greater than that in our previous study the amount of improvement in normal walking speed by gcqid was very similar to that found for the gcqid group in our previous study.11 therefore we assert that gcqid likely produced a similar effect as in our previous study in terms of walking parameters .", " the current study investigated attitudes toward metabolic adverse events in a nationwide survey of japanese patients with schizophrenia . after reviewing the relevant

adverse events among patients with schizophrenia . more than half of outpatients felt obese and more than half of all respondents hoped to receive regular blood tests to prevent metabolic adverse events . although patients with severe mental illnesses are less aware of comorbid medical conditions such as heart disease diabetes and hypertension17 patients judged disorders such as epilepsy and diabetes as worse than schizophrenia16 and described dissatisfaction or deficiency with regard to the care that they received from their health care providers.18 buckley et al showed that most psychiatrists did not routinely monitor their patients lipid profiles blood glucose levels or blood pressure.12 we previously reported that most psychiatrists in japan monitor the lipid profiles and blood glucose levels of their inpatients and outpatients more than twice a year.14 most psychiatrists stated that the frequency at which they monitored patients under antipsychotic treatment was based on their own clinical experience . it is necessary to disseminate monitoring guidelines with regard to metabolic adverse events because they might make psychiatrists more aware of an integral approach to patients with schizophrenia thereby increasing the physical health monitoring of these patients.44 in japan the mental health act seeks to promote the concept of normalization establishing mental illness as a disability and encouraging the re assimilation of psychiatric inpatients back into the community . this study showed that only a minority of patients were mindful of eating balanced meals and having physical exercise however more than half of patients hoped to prevent weight gain and diabetes .", " giant cell tumor gct is a tumor found most often in the ends of long bones and is essentially located in the epiphyseal or metaphyseal or epiphyseal equivalent portions of bone . rare multicentric forms have been reported.13 in this article we report a case of gct originating from the anterior arc of the rib which was diagnosed on fine needle aspiration cytology fnac . cytological smears were cellular and comprising aggregates of uniform appearing spindled stromal cells and innumerable osteoclast type giant cells having variable number of nuclei . in correlation with radiographic findings of an eccentric expanded lytic lesion with cortical erosion of anterior arc of fourth rib figure 2 a diagnosis of aggressive giant cell tumor of rib was offered cytologically . inset showing histomorphology of the resected giant cell tumor h and e 400 large expansile tumor mass with thinned out cortex in the anterior end of fourth rib noted on computed tomography scan in view of the cytomorphological diagnosis and radiological cortical destruction of anterior arc of fourth rib patient was referred to a surgical oncology centre with a possibility of soft tissue extension being also considered . on a routine radiograph gct presents as an initially eccentric expanded lytic lesion without a surrounding sclerotic halo representing the cortical bone . with the clinical symptomatic presentation of a rapidly growing mass and radiological evidence of bone destruction and expansion a cytomorphological diagnosis of an aggressive gct was offered in this case . a wide array of lesions may histologically mimic depending on the quality and size of the biopsy . giant cell rich osteosarcoma and mfh are characterized by nuclear anaplasia and abnormal mitotic figures and in the gct there is no neoplastic osteoid formation which is the most pathognomonic finding of a giant cell rich osteosarcoma . except for the lack of bony involvement primary giant cell tumor of soft tissue resembles in all its cyto histomorphological features its osseous counterpart.24 in general all gct s should be considered potentially aggressive and wide excision is recommended .", " therefore the potential risk associated with infertility and treatment must be considered for infertile patients after conservative treatment for bot . reported that the overall success rates of ivf were satisfactory for this group of patients suggesting no known negative impact of prior bot on pregnancy rates after ivf 11 . the purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of coh ivf in infertile patients after conservative treatment for bot . a retrospective review of ivf records from january 1999 to july 2005 revealed 10 attempted ivf cycles in five patients who had been previously diagnosed with bot and had had conservative treatment to preserve fertility . the main outcome measures were pregnancy outcomes such as clinical pregnancy rate cpr implantation rate ir and live birth rate lbr after coh ivf and the recurrence of bot during the follow up period . a retrospective review of ivf records from january 1999 to july 2005 revealed 10 attempted ivf cycles in five patients who had been previously diagnosed with bot and had had conservative treatment to preserve fertility . the main outcome measures were pregnancy outcomes such as clinical pregnancy rate cpr implantation rate ir and live birth rate lbr after coh ivf and the recurrence of bot during the follow up period . since the prognosis for bot is excellent patients of childbearing age can be treated with conservative surgery to preserve fertility 2 3 . however the risk from ovarian hyperstimulation in patients treated for early stage bot is low . reported five pregnancies in 16 patients who subsequently underwent ivf after conservative treatment for bot and found no case of relapse during the follow up period 46 months on average 10 . reported 17 ivf cycles in five patients after conservative bot treatment . in our present study the cpr and lbr for 7 ivf cycles in patients with early stage bot was 42.9 37 cycles and 42.9 37 cycle respectively . the achieved pregnancy outcomes suggest that prior bot diagnosis and treatment have no perceptible negative impact on pregnancy outcomes in coh ivf . therefore coh ivf can be safely offered to the patients with early stage bot . however there are few reports on the safety of coh ivf in cases of advanced stage bot after conservative treatment . at present however it is not yet possible to provide guidelines for coh ivf in patients with advanced stage bot despite successful pregnancy outcomes 11 13 19 . it seems that the number of coh ivf cycles should be limited in patients with advanced stage bot because rapid progression to invasive ovarian cancer after a successful delivery with the first ivf cycle has been reported 20 . reported a 29 recurrence rate in an ivf treatment group that was not significantly different from the 19 recurrence in the non ivf group 16 . in our study no recurrence of bot was detected after coh ivf this is a lower recurrence rate than reported in patients who underwent conservative treatment without subsequent fertility treatment . although the perod of 29.6 14 61 months is not a long follow up period our results suggest that coh ivf may not affect recurrence of bot and that pregnancy per se has no effect on the course of bot . in conclusion the current study suggests that ivf may be considered for infertile patients after conservative treatment for early stage bot . for patients with advanced stage bot larger clinical trials with longer follow up are necessary to evaluate the safety and efficacy of coh ivf .", " this review describes the relationship among extracellular matrix ecm molecules cell adhesion molecules cams matrix metalloproteinases mmps and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases timps in making possible the phenomena of long term potentiation ltp habituation associative learning and memory and perhaps drug addiction . such characteristics of mmps make them attractive concerning their potential contribution to memory consolidation reconsolidation and retrieval . mmp2 mmp3 and mmp9 reach measurable levels in the mammalian brain especially if the animal is challenged with a change in its environment e.g. mmps are also activated during stress brain trauma and ischemia 22 4447 . mmps are also involved in the myelination of axons in both central and peripheral nervous systems during development and following damage from injury or disease . the disruption of this timp mmp balance impacts cns ecm to cell and cell to cell signaling . these results were interpreted to suggest that mmp9 expression is involved in activity dependent remodeling via influencing synaptic connections . although our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the functional remodeling of synaptic pathways remains incomplete it is becoming clear that such reconfiguration involves alterations in the levels of mmps and timps . hippocampal slice cultures taken from mmp9 knockout mice revealed impaired ltp which was restored with the addition of recombinant mmp9 . this potential could be inhibited by blocking integrin signaling suggesting that mmp9 may mediate neural plasticity via integrins . using prefrontal cortex slices okulski and colleagues reported that mmp9 is necessary for late stage ltp and treatment with an mmp9 inhibitor prevented the formation of late stage ltp . found that spine enlargement during hippocampal ltp is dependent upon mmp9 and protein synthesis . the intrahippocampal infusion of an mmp2 and 9 inhibitor followed by titanic stimulation resulted in a strong potentiation comparable to control ltp . our laboratory has measured hsr habituation induced increases in mmp3 expression in the hippocampus prefrontal and piriform cortices with no change in the cerebellum . elevations in hippocampal mmp9 activity were also measured in these habituated animals accompanied by decreases in the prefrontal cortex . to our surprise yoked control rats introduced to the test environment but not hsr habituated also revealed intermediate elevations in mmp3 expression in the hippocampus and piriform cortices as compared with habituated and home cage control rats . these results suggested that elevations in mmp3 could mediate the changes in neural plasticity that may accompany habituation however the introduction of the animal into a new environment also appeared to elevate mmp3 expression in these same brain structures but to a lesser extent . given that mmps are responsible for degrading and restructuring the ecm it is not surprising that they have been investigated with regard to seizure associative learning and memory . in addition mmps are known to play an important role in synaptic remodeling that results from hippocampal differentiation 130 131 . our laboratory noted mmp9 elevations in the prefrontal and piriform cortices of rats tested in an object recognition task and in the prefrontal and hippocampal cortices of rats that were successful in solving the morris water maze task . who noted significant elevations in hippocampal mmp3 and 9 during acquisition of the morris water maze task . have reported significant elevations in hippocampal mmp9 levels following inhibition avoidance learning in rats peaking at 1224 hours following training and declining to baseline by three days post training . intrahippocampal infusion of a mmp2 and 9 inhibitor 3.5 hours following inhibitory avoidance training significantly diminished subsequent recall . bilateral dorsal hippocampus injections of fn439 or a specific mmp3 inhibitor interfered with acquisition of the association between a signaling tone and the hsr such that only a very weak association was present when retested 24 hours later figure 3 . specifically interference with activation of mmp3 in the dorsal hippocampus appears to significantly disrupt the acquisition and memory storage of this association . there is accumulating evidence to support the notion that mmp3 and 9 are of significant importance in the acquisition of several forms of associative learning including object recognition spatial passive avoidance and classical conditioning . most recently these investigators have shown that mmp9 increased in the prefrontal cortex following cocaine reinstatement of cpp in rats . by 24 hours mmp9 up regulation had returned to control levels in the stimulant treated mice but was still elevated in those mice that received the higher toxic dose . presumably these ethanol induced declines in active mmp9 levels attenuated the formation of new neural pathways thus interfering with memory consolidation . these findings suggest that deviations in brain mmp activity may be prerequisite to reconfiguration of the ecm molecules that permit synaptic reconfiguration and the establishment of new memories . this review brings together available information concerning the hypothesis that it is the interaction among ecm molecules mmps cams and timps that permits the formation of new neural pathways in the brain . are the same molecules ecm cams mmps timps involved in this transfer process does the ultimate storage location depend upon the type of learning andor the sensory systems involved 6 what is the role of neural plasticity in drug addiction there are many unanswered questions regarding the influence of drugs on ltp stimulated mmp release and activation and equally important the role of timps during ltp .", " place the cryo grid box near the location of the aluminum heat sink and mark

characterized by chronic obstruction of expiratory flow affecting peripheral airways and is often associated with chronic bronchitis and emphysema thereby accelerating the decline in lung function.23 previous studies have found that nutritional status is the prognostic factor that is associated with the mortality in copd.46 weight loss is the major characteristic of malnutrition in copd.7 in 2002 nutritional risk was defined by the european society for parenteral and enteral nutrition espen.8 recently nutritional risk was found to be associated with the exacerbation of copd in the patients who were hospitalized because of copd.9 meanwhile it has been reported that nutritional risk is related to the development of copd in male smokers.10 in addition the exercise capacity is also another factor related to mortality in copd.11 limitation of the exercise capacity seriously affects the quality of life in copd patients.12 therefore many studies have aimed at strategies for improving the exercise capacity of copd patients.1314 however this effective and feasible strategy still needs further exploration . it has been reported that nutritional status could affect the exercise capacity in copd patients.1516 moreover nutritional supply seems to contribute to improving the exercise capacity.1517 in view of these findings we speculated that there might be some relationship between nutritional risk and exercise capacity . therefore we explored this relationship in severe copd male patients in this study which could provide evidence for the effect of nutritional supply on exercise capacity . among the total 58 severe copd male patients 25 were assessed as having nutritional risk and assigned to the nutritional risk group . before exercise there was no statistically

capacity in copd patients.1516 however it is still unclear whether a correlation exists between nutritional risk and exercise capacity in copd patients . therefore we investigated the relationship between nutritional risk and exercise capacity in severe copd male patients . in this study we found significantly lower weight and bmi in severe copd male patients with nutritional risk compared to those of severe copd male patients without nutritional risk which are the characteristics of copd patients with nutritional risk.2426 besides pft showed that dlco in severe copd male patients without nutritional risk was significantly higher than that in severe copd male patients with nutritional risk . cpet showed that the peak vo2 and peak o2 pulse of the nutritional risk group were significantly lower than those of the no nutritional risk group and there were significant negative correlations between the nrs score and peak vo2 or peak o2 pulse . these results indicate that the oxygen uptake of severe copd male patients with nutritional risk was significantly lower than that of severe copd male patients without nutritional risk which might be due to the impaired oxygen transport in copd3335 thereby affecting the utilization of oxygen.36 it was reported that inadequate oxygen supply during exercise caused accumulation of oxygen deficit which was responsible for the reduced exercise capacity in patients with copd.3738 meanwhile decreased muscle oxygen utilization could reduce the exercise capacity in patients with copd.39 thus impaired oxygen transport may be the main reason for reduced exercise capacity in copd patients with nutritional risk . the results of this study supported the association between exercise capacity and nutritional risk according to nrs 2002 in severe copd male patients .", "", " nonpulsatile subjective tinnitus is considered a phantom perception the conscious awareness of a percept in the absence of an external stimulus . whereas tinnitus can be considered a simple phantom percept dreams could be considered complex phantom percepts like hallucinations and hallucinosis 9 10 . a clear clinical analogy exists between phantom pain and disabling tinnitus 1 14 15 . in view of the pathophysiological analogy between tinnitus and pain it can be hypothesized that tinnitus is absent in the dream state as well . a recently proposed pathophysiological model of phantom sound based on a predictive brain concept with bayesian updating might explain why tinnitus is not perceived during dreaming . people with tinnitus do not perceive tinnitus in their dreams analogous to what is reported for many phantom limb perceptions 21 25 . dreams and wakefulness are both associated with awareness but in one state of awareness there is no tinnitus dreams whereas in the other wakefulness there is tinnitus . the reason why patients with tinnitus do not perceive tinnitus in their dream state can be theoretically explained by the bayesian brain model which has been used as an explanation for the development of tinnitus in relation to auditory deafferentation . whereas other models see for an overview can explain the tinnitus in the presence of deafferentation the bayesian model is compatible with both the deafferentation and noise cancelling models and provides a rationale why tinnitus develops in a wake state and not in a dream state . this means that the discrepancy between top down predictions and the absence of sensory signals received will not be registered and the auditory deafferentation will not be filled in resulting in the absence of tinnitus in the dream state see figures 2a and 2b . in addition to its evident benefit for tinnitus research it could also provide clues for consciousness research by delineating the core areas involved in the neural correlates of consciousness that is minimal assembly of brain areas required for consciousness per se 38 39 . other potential explanations for the absence of tinnitus in the dream state have to be considered . in conclusion this report demonstrates that tinnitus perception is switched off during dream sleep even though there is awareness like in wakefulness .", " moreover computed tomography ct scans with 1mm slices were performed to examine the potential insertion pathway of the c1 lateral mass screw and c2 pedicle screw and ct angiography in the area of c1 2 was used to visualize the pathway of the va for examining potential anomalies and reducing the possible complication of va injury . before marking the entry point of the c2 screw the medial border of the c2 pedicle was identified to prevent screw malposition in the spinal canal . non parametric analysis was performed in the both unilateral and bilateral screw fixation groups . the mann whitney u test was used to compare the bony fusion rate between the unilateral and bilateral screw fixation methods . before marking the entry point of the c2 screw the medial border of the c2 pedicle was identified to prevent screw malposition in the spinal canal . non parametric analysis was performed in the both unilateral and bilateral screw fixation groups . the mann whitney u test was used to compare the bony fusion rate between the unilateral and bilateral screw fixation methods . unilateral c1 lateral mass and c2 pedicle screw fixation was performed in 11 patients 44 in this study fig . meanwhile in the bilateral screw fixation group the mean age was 55.9 years range 40 72 with a female predominance 85.7 table 1 fig . in the 11 patients in the unilateral screw fixation group the preoperative mean adi was 8.14 mm and the mean immediate postoperative adi was reduced to 1.82 mm . on the other hand in the 14 patients in the bilateral screw fixation group the mean preoperative adi was 8.48 mm and that at postoperative 1 3 6 and 12 months was 1.99 mm 1.96 mm 1.91 mm and 1.90 mm respectively table 1 . the surgical method of c1 2 complex fixation has been introduced by many surgeons and bilateral transarticular screw fixation using the wiring technique of gallie or brooks jenkins has achieved the highest stability and stiffness2712 . however bilateral transarticular screw fixation taf is not always possible because of va anomalies or fracture of the c1 2 complex1314 . the superiority of c1lm c2p fixation compared to taf is a lower risk of va injury due to the use of individual screw systems . in other words if the risk of injuring the va and spinal cord can be predicted preoperatively abandoning screw placement in an ipsilateral side with anatomical variation may be a wise decision . in addition the strength of fusion in the unilateral screw fixation groups was as strong as that in the bilateral screw fixation group . if there is a risk of va damage the choice to abandon predictable screw insertion will increase the safety and completeness of the surgical technique of c1lm c2p screw fixation . our study illustrated that unilateral screw fixation shows similar strength bony fusion and reduction rate as bilateral screw fixation . even though we were able to demonstrate that unilateral screw fixation is similar to bilateral fixation in terms of strength bony fusion and reduction rate several limitations of our study must be considered .", " have lately experienced lelca that occurred in the urinary bladder and thus have reported the case along with philological considerations . if other classification is applied lelca was classified as pure when 100 of the tumor showed lymphoepithelioma like carcinoma pattern and mixed when associated with usual infiltrating urothelial carcinoma adenocarcinoma or squamous carcinoma 2 . it has been suggested that pure predominant lelca responds to chemotherapy and may best be treated with bladder preservation therapy 1 13 . according to previous reports pure and predominant lelca is more favorable than focal lelca in prognosis 2 3 7 . this case was the predominant type that lelca accounted for over 90 of lesions and was fractionally accompanied with non invasive transitional cell carcinoma . 5 note that it is imperative to distinguish between lelca and malignant lymphoma as primary bladder lymphoma is extremely rare . the principal symptoms of lelca were mostly gross hematuria solitary mass and tumors measured 1 to 5 cm 10 12 . for lelca treatment surgical therapy and chemotherapy can be applied . lelca is a rare tumor and it is important to differentiate it from other tumors .", " pgd2 acts through two receptors dp1 and dp2 crth2 whereas 15d pgj2 can activate peroxisome proliferator activated receptors or inhibit a range of proinflammatory signaling pathways including nfb 1 2 5 . the importance of the role of pgd2 in the pathogenesis and resolution of inflammation and innate immune response is increasingly recognized 6 7 . however the effect of pgd2 on inflammation is complex because pgd2 either promotes or suppresses inflammation depending on the inflammatory milieu . this is further complicated by the fact that pgd2 undergoes nonenzymatic processes to generate 15d pgj2 an anti inflammatory lipid . here we review the biology and role of pgd synthases and pgd2 in inflammation and host immune response . h pgds contributes to the production of the d and j series of prostanoids in the immune system and is involved in allergic inflammatory response . since h pgds is present in mast cells th2 cells and other leukocytes it is thought to be responsible for the bulk of pgd2 production during allergic responses 16 17 . using h pgds knockout mice showed that h pgds synthesizes 15d pgj2 during mammalian defense responses and together with pgd2 acting through the dp1 receptor plays a central role in controlling the onset of acute inflammation and its resolution by balancing pro versus anti inflammatory cytokines . similar to h pgds in models of allergic inflammation l pgds has shown to be proinflammatory . our study showed that h pgds was constitutively expressed in vitro in macrophages whereas l pgds is induced in a time dependent manner in response to lps or pa103 . pgd2 for a long time was considered as a minor and biologically inactive prostaglandin . pgd 2 has been implicated in the initiation and progression of inflammation . in contrast to these proinflammatory effects pgd 2 and its cyclopentenone prostaglandin derivatives also have anti inflammatory properties with functions in resolution of inflammation . there is considerable interest in the importance of pgd2 and its distal products in the mediation and resolution of inflammation 3 57 . although several studies have investigated the role of pgd 2 in inflammation the role of pgd2 in host immune response has been scantly studied . although the production of pgd2 was increased in vitro the functional effects of pgd2 in this setting remain unclear . we have shown that pgd2 inhibits a key proinflammatory immunoglobulin cell surface receptor trem1 in vitro in macrophages . the role of pgds pgd 2 in regulating inflammation in a variety of organ systems and disease process is burgeoning . it is now evident that endogenous biochemical pathways such as pgds pgd 2 get activated during defense reactions . the effect of pgds pgd2 on inflammation is complex because they can either promote or suppresses inflammation depending on the inflammatory milieu . interdiction of l pgds pgd2 and dp receptors provides novel therapeutic approaches to modulate inflammation and innate immune responses .", " according to preliminary studies we recognize that ca is able to inhibit tumor in mouse except for these with t cells defect which suggests that immune system can be one of the targets of tumor suppression . to explore the expression level of genes in tumor cells we utilized a microarray technique to detect balb c emt6 mice after treatment with ca docetaxel interferon normal saline separately and the differences in expression level were confirmed by rt qpcr . time series analysis go analysis and pathway analysis were used to screen out common genes and analyze the relationship between putative genes and anticancer process of ca . our data has suggested that ca is able to inhibit the growth of tumor through regulating immune system . rna extracted from experimental group of ca positive control group of docetaxel and interferon negative control group were used to measure expression of selected genes of interest by rt qpcr . genes can nfatc2 nfatc3 and nfatc2ip showed a different expression level following treatment with low medium and high dose ca respectively . genes covered in this curve were upregulated as seen from the whole time cycle in other word ca is capable of upregulating certain genes of tumor bearing mice . as shown in table 2 96 pathways are found to be related to upregulated genes and 29 of them are found to be statistically significant including t cell receptor signaling pathway b cell receptor signaling pathway and natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity . immune related genes expression is speculated changed after treatment with ca and probably have a trend of upregulation . to sum up ca has been proved capable of strengthening cellular immune functions to tumor . when 3 immune related pathways were found including upregulated genes we inferred that the immunity of mouse had been improved after treatment of ca . nfatc2 nfatc3 nfatc2ip and can were found through combing raw analysis data of gene expression profile as shown in table 5 . relative expression level of the target genes nfatc2 nfatc3 nfatc2ip and can on average is shown in table 6 . relative expression level of nfatc2 nfatc3 nfatc2ip and can in high dose ca group nfatc2ip and can in medium dose ca group and can in low dose ca group significantly improved compared with negative control group . as shown in figure 2 relative expression level of nfatc2ip nfatc3 nfatc2 and can in high dose ca group improved compared with negative control group which corresponds to the result of microarray analysis . through the analysis of genes included in no.21 expression of critical genes in t cell receptor signaling pathway b cell receptor signaling pathway and natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity had changed and immune related genes nfatc2ip nfatc3 nfatc2 and can were found . high expression of nfatc2 and nfatc3 is in favor of the secretion of these cytokines which have already been used as nonspecific immunity treatment to cancer . can is able to make nfat existing in cytoplasm move into cell nucleus after dephosphorylation to finish following transcription and translation and then nfatc can combine with ap1 family members alone or in groups to stimulate secretion of cell factors in certain areas such as il2 . thus high expression of can is a benefit to dephosphorylation of nfat and indirectly has an effect upon immune system . the result of microarray analysis of differentially expressed genes of female balb c emt6 mice has indicated that the antitumor mechanism of ca is closely related to body s immune system . through upregulating the expression of can nfatc2 nfatc2ip and nfatc3 ca is able to improve the transcription of immune factors like il2r and ifn stimulate proliferation and activation of t cells nk cells and macrophage strengthen monitoring and killing abilities of cancer cells and inhibit growth of tumor finally .", " conventional mode of diagnosis of filariasis is by demonstration of microfilaria in peripheral blood smear . despite high incidence it is

previously suggested that blood loss during renal dilation with amplatz instruments is higher . as there are various methods of tract performance inter infracostal approach various calyx punctures utilization of access sheath etc . we hypothesized that it may not be the dilator type itself but rather the way they are utilized that may influence the type of complications . the aim of our study was to compare these two methods of tract dilation in terms of efficacy and safety and to find out what may be the source of differences in complication rates . two methods of tract dilation were utilized group i n123 comprised patients where alken dilatator was used group ii n99 comprised patients where the amplatz dilator was used . both procedures were conducted by two experienced endourologists one used the alken dilator and the other used the amplatz dilator . our amplatz dilator technique was a standard technique well described in the literature where the final stages may be replaced with a tubeless option . our amplatz dilator technique was a standard technique well described in the literature where the final stages may be replaced with a tubeless option . tract dilation failures although more frequent in group i were not significantly different between the groups . as stated earlier the alken dilators are allegedly safer than the amplatz dilators due to maintenance of continuous hemostatic pressure on the kidney parenchyma . in our study both types of tract dilation were comparable in terms of blood loss . similarly the tract dilation failure rate was comparable between the two groups which is consistent with other study outcomes . in our experience this may be due to the fact that in the alken group the puncture was most often through the lower calyx and the wire was positioned in the renal pelvis . the way in which pnl may be performed with alken and amplatz dilators differs among urological departments . indeed our study did not compare two different dilators but rather two different methods of tract dilation where both have their pros and cons . based on our study we can not determine the superiority of one method of tract dilation over the other as these two approaches were completely different in terms of punctured calyx inter infracostal access and utilization or not of a sheath . total operative time tract dilation time fluoroscopy time and tract dilation failure were comparable between the two groups . it is clear that all differences resulted from the punctured calyx type of access to the kidney inter infracostal and utilization or not of an access sheath rather than the type of dilator itself .", " oab is known to be a highly prevalent disorder that increases with age in both sexes and that has a profound impact on quality of

interindividual variability and antidrug antibodies adabs have been identified as one of the major factors impacting their clearance . thus serum trough levels and adab measurement have been proposed for the monitoring of anti tnf drugs and algorithms were defined for the management of patients with ibd . nonetheless studies in patients with ibd have extensively demonstrated the efficiency of anti tnf therapies which directly inhibit activation of effector t cells and sensitize them to treg mediated inhibition with final restoration of immune homeostasis resolution of inflammation and mucosal healing . infliximab ifx a chimeric monoclonal antibody composed of human constant and murine variable regions and adalimumab a fully human monoclonal igg1 anti tnf antibody demonstrated their efficacy for the control of disease activity and the induction of clinical remission and mucosal healing in luminal cd and uc both in children and adult patients 1 1925 . despite the high effectiveness of anti tnf in patients with ibd more than one third of patients present primary resistance and another one third become resistant over time . however the main factor impacting anti tnf pharmacokinetic and efficacy over time is immunogenicity whereby antidrug antibodies adabs accelerate anti tnf monoclonal abs clearance and shorten their half life 41 42 . contrastingly prescription of maintenance therapy with concomitant immunomodulators and achievement of suitable trough drug levels have been shown to reduce the risk of adabs . however in an observational study evaluating the efficacy of adalimumab in 168 active cd patients who failed to respond to ifx long term clinical benefit was significantly associated with higher serum trough concentrations and absence of adab . a recent study using adalimumab maintenance therapy in 40 adult patients with cd or uc showed a significant association of high trough levels of adalimumab with clinical remission and mucosal healing . serum trough levels measurement to detect subtherapeutic drug concentrations and identification of adab therapeutic drug monitoring or tdm are the most relevant and useful parameters for the monitoring of anti tnf drugs to facilitate informed decision making in ibd patients with secondary loss of response to tnf antagonists . when adabs were detected the switch to another anti tnf molecule allowed a partial or complete response in 92 versus 17 for dose escalation whereas drug escalation was the most efficient strategy in patients with subtherapeutic ifx concentration 86 versus 33 of partial or complete response resp . they concluded that increasing anti tnf doses is ineffective in patients with adab but appropriate in case of subtherapeutic drug concentration and proposed an algorithm for optimization of therapeutic strategy in ibd patients with loss of response to ifx based on adab and trough drug measurement . in case of a loss of response with low trough level without adab an intensified therapy with the same drug when low trough level is related to the presence of adabs therapy should be switched within the anti tnf class and if necessary to a drug with another mode of action . the addition of an immunomodulator might also be able to induce a decrease in adab level and to restore clinical response . continued maintenance therapy with ifx induced adab disappearance in two thirds of these patients after a median of 4 infusions suggesting that continued anti tnf treatment could be considered in patients with clinical response and first adab detection . in the monitored arm patients with low serum ifx and atis were switched to adalimumab patients with low serum ifx without atis underwent dose intensification and patients with high ifx trough levels with or without atis were switched to an out of class therapy or screened for an alternate cause of their symptoms . large prospective and randomized studies are still required to validate all these approaches in patients with ibd and clear dose toxicity efficacy relationships have yet to be established for anti tnf inhibitors . since the advent of anti tnf biologics more than a decade ago they have demonstrated beneficial activity in induction and maintenance of clinical responses mucosal healing improvement in quality of life reduction in surgeries and hospitalizations and the treatment of

initial mutation of large effect and the resulting improbability of finding an equally monstrous mate dobzhansky 1937 . recombination of parental chromosomes in the f2 and later generations during hybridization can generate genotypes that express phenotypes outside the normal range of variation observed in either parental gene pool a phenomenon termed transgressive segregation rosenthal et al . often transgressive hybrids have higher fitness in novel environments increasing the likelihood of divergence from parental populations arnold and hodges 1995 buerkle et al . a few examples of new phenotypes inferred to arise from hybridization include see arnold 1997 arnold 2006 stelkens and seehausen 2009 for more exhaustive reviews extreme size of tiger x lion f1 hybrids gray 1954 unique shapes and colors of hybrid orchids rolfe and hurst 1909 ability of recombinant sunflowers to thrive in extreme habits lexer et al . not all specific examples are relevant in nature and not all would qualify as evolutionary novelty under certain definitions muller and wagner 1991 pigliucci 2008 wagner and lynch 2010 but this small selection of cases serves to illustrate sudden appearance of profound differences between parents and hybrid offspring reminiscent of goldschmidt s hopeful monsters.fig . the late generation hybrid has both a transgressive coloration and body size mass and snout vent length beyond the range of parental populations arnold and colleagues have promoted the importance of transgressive segregation as the evolutionary novelty model of hybridization arnold 1997 arnold et al . mallet 2007 even referred to transgressive hybrids as hopeful monsters and p. bateson 1984 2002 proposed a simple model for the sudden appearance and successful spread of a novel phenotype via hybridization as a mechanism of saltational evolution . genotypes with asterisks are novel recombinant true breeding genotypes genetically explicit versions of bateson s model . moreover even if interactions at other loci render some hybrids even f1 hybrids partly or mostly sterile recombination could produce transgressive hybrids with restored fertility in the f2 and later generations fig . both models describe gene interaction epistasis causing a hybrid phenotype to fall outside the range for either parental population . the additive complementation model c shows how recombinants can be phenotypically extreme relative to parentals aabb and aabb even without gene interaction each a or b allele contributes an amount x to the phenotypic value regardless of the other locus . the additive complementation model c shows how recombinants can be phenotypically extreme relative to parentals aabb and aabb even without gene interaction each a or b allele contributes an amount x to the phenotypic value regardless of the other locus . the primary prediction characterizing many years of speciation research is that hybridization between disparate genomes will often generate novel phenotypes that are inviable or sterile hopeless monsters and this becomes ever more likely with increasing differentiation dobzhansky 1937 mayr 1942 muller 1942 orr and turelli 2001 coyne and orr 2004 gavrilets 2004 . the most important prediction arising from hybridization as a source of novelty is that admixed populations with many recombinant individuals repeatedly bring together many genetic differences in many unique combinations . second segregating hybrid populations will repeatedly produce recombinant genotypes with transgressive phenotypes figs . 1998 we predict fixation of novel transgressive hybrids to be more rapid and perhaps more common in haploid and allopolyploid hybrids . all of the recombinant hybrids in haploid and allopolyploid populations will be true breeding compared to just a fraction of diploid recombinant hybrids fig . this might lead to lower average fitness of a diploid hybrid population that contains some high fitness transgressive phenotypes for several generations after hybridization is initiated johnson et al . recombination of fixed genetic differences between two populations in the f2 and later generations can produce hybrids with phenotypes novel to both parental populations fig . even if most of the variation produced is deleterious a rare transgressive hybrid genotype could rapidly fix in a population or establish a novel lineage .", " studies on the etiology of dental caries have identified some risk factors such as consuming foods and beverages with a high content of refined carbohydrates receiving bottle feed for a prolonged period having deficient hygiene etc . given the strong evidence supporting the relationship of dental caries with irregular dietary patterns and the link between abnormal dietary intake and obesity several reports described the link between caries and weight indicating that obese children had more caries than children in the normal weight group . yet till now there is no national data concerning caries status among school children native of this area and less is known about the relationship of caries and weight status . the aims of the present study were 1 to assess the caries prevalence and severity in 8year old children of qingdao and 2 to assess the relationship between caries disease and the weight status in 8year old children of qingdao . the overall

severity figure 2 . comparison of caries status according to bmi classification pearson s correlation of bmi and caries experience . although this rate was similar to that reported in other domestic studies 85.4 of caries prevalence in children of similar age group in guangzhou the average dmft index 4.31 in our study was significantly higher than that reported dmft index 3.11 in the study of guangzhou . furthermore caries prevalence and dmft value in these 8year old children from qingdao were significantly higher than those reported from other countries such as sudan . also we utilized two indices dmft and dmft dmft to assess the caries severity in children both in deciduous and mixed dentition . regardless of the index used in the analysis instead of a previously suspected positive link a weak inverse relationship of body weight and caries severity was found and the comparison also showed underweight individuals to have significantly more severe caries disease . this finding suggested that the relationship of obesity and caries was not as straightforward as was earlier suspected . moreover although not focusing on an identical age group our result is consistent with a nationally representative survey based on a dataset of 10800 american adolescents national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes iii 19881994 and nhanes 19992002 which suggested that overweight status may be associated with a somewhat decreased risk for caries . our results showed that underweight children were more likely found with more severe caries disease regardless of primary or mixed dentition . one limitation of our study is the use of cross sectional data to examine the link between caries experience and weight status . although this rate was similar to that

based epidemiological survey on caries and body weight status in 8year old children in qingdao china . our study identified a weak negative association between caries severity and weight status in this pilot population indicating caries lesions might be a reason affecting the growth and development of children . our finding suggested that until more evidence is available obesity should not be considered as a risk factor for caries diagnosis and treatment planning in children .", " once secreted in extracellular milieu the endosomal intraluminal vesicles ilvs are referred to as exosomes . our review will stick to this strict definition of exosomes to discuss the most recent findings indicating the potential role of neuronal exosomes in intercellular communication within the normal and pathological central nervous system . it is now widely accepted that exosomes represent a way of intercellular exchange of effector molecules which allows emitting cells to modify gene and protein expression in receiving cells . therefore the exosomal pathway may constitute a well designed mechanism for local and systemic inter neuronal transfer of information within functional brain networks with a complexity superior to that of direct cell to cell contacts or secreted soluble factors belting and wittrup 2008 . once in the extracellular milieu ilvs exosomes released by cell a can bind to and be endocytosed by a receiving cell cell b 8 . once inside the endosome the exosome undergoes back fusion with the endosomal membrane 10 . the compartments fusing at the plasma membrane of cultured neurons were identified as recycling endosomes because tfr is usually detected in recycling endosomes and rab11 or syntaxin 13 are known regulators of recycling endosomes . thus even if fluorescence data suggest that endosomes fusing to the plasma membrane during synaptic plasticity are recycling endosomes one can not yet exclude that some of these endosomes are mvbs . the final proof that mvbs fuse to the dendritic surface awaited the visualization of this process by em and the demonstration that exosome release is modified by synaptic glutamate receptor activity . we made the first demonstration that cortical neurons in culture release exosomes faure et al . as in the case of other cells exosomes isolated from neuron culture media floated on sucrose gradients at a density of 1.11.2 g ml and contained both tsg101 and alix . 2002 was not detected in exosomes demonstrating that entry of cargoes into ilvs is regulated . exosomes also contained ampa but not nmda receptors and the cell adhesion molecule l1ngcam which in the central nervous system is expressed only by neurons maness and schachner 2007 thus demonstrating that exosomes are secreted by neurons . we also observed that electrical activity regulates exosomal secretion since long term depolarization of neurons with 25 mm potassium strongly increased the release of ampa r containing exosomes . three other studies reported secretion of exosomes by neurons vingtdeux et al . thus exosome release could simply reflect the fusion of late endosomes lysosomes at growth cones necessary for neurite elongation arantes and andrews 2006 . em examination of cultures treated for 1 min with ionomycin revealed clusters of exosomes at the surface of dendrites visualizing the fusion of mvbs with the plasma membrane . altogether our data suggest that calcium entry through synaptic nmda receptors is a potent activator of mvb fusion to the plasma membrane and thereby of exosome secretion . in this scenario regulation of the pool of surface synaptic receptors by exosome secretion would be a local event avoiding retrograde transport of mvbs necessary to hydrolyze the receptors in lysosomes which are only present in proximal dendrites and soma . those released by neurons into the cns parenchyma could potentially be endocytosed by nearby cells as shown for oligodendrocyte derived exosomes which are endocytosed by microglial cells fitzner et al . astrocyte end feet which enwrap a number of glutamatergic synapses can also endocytose phagocytose cellular debris haydon and carmignoto 2006 and could thus capture exosomes released at synapses . transfer of exosomes could also occur between spines of the same neuron or across synapses to end up in afferent neurons . indeed the diameter of neuronal exosomes is compatible with possible endocytosis in neuronal clathrin coated pits occurring in presynaptic boutons in spines or dendritic shafts lu et al . we have recently obtained evidence that exosomes bind to and are endocytosed by hippocampal neurons unpublished observations and that they allow the inter neuronal transfer of tetanus toxin which is known to cross synapses in vivo lachenal et al . in non neuronal cells the fact that exosomal rnas can act on receiving cells demonstrates that exosome intralumenal cargoes are released into the cytosol i.e. these puzzling hypotheses require in vivo work i to show that exosomal released from mvbs occurs in situ ii to find out the privileged site of this release iii to demonstrate transynaptic exchange of exosomes . furthermore even though the activity dependent release of exosomes suggests a genuine function of exosomes in synaptic plasticity molecular tools to specifically block mvb fusion with the plasma membrane must be developed to test this hypothesis . nevertheless studies on exosomes in the cns are bound to shed new light on intercellular exchanges within the brain and to open new avenues toward understanding how neurodegenerative diseases spread over time throughout the nervous system .", " intravenous ureterography ivu showed findings compatible with a left sciatic ureter a dilated ureter with a fixed kinking which is known as the abdominal ct showed marked hydronephrosis and hydroureter on the level of the pelvic inlet and revealed the presence of a sciatic herniation of the ureter fig . the ureter was seen to course behind the left hip and through the greater sciatic foramen anterior to the piriformis muscle . ivu obtained 3 months after the removal of the ureteral stent revealed the recurrence of the ureterosciatic hernia however there was no evident recurrence of hydroureter hydronephrosis or ureteral obstruction . most ureteral herniations occur in the inguinal area but they have also been noted in femoral sciatic thoracic and parailiac locations . among them ureterosciatic herniation is extremely uncommon only 31 cases have been reported since 1947 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 . the diagnosis is difficult to establish by physical examination because ureterosciatic hernias are deep to the gluteal muscles . ureterosciatic herniations usually occur through the suprapiriformis compartment of the greater sciatic foramen 5 10 . in previous reports treatments for symptomatic patients included relief of the hernia by excision and reimplantation ureteroureterostomy or stent placement and observation 2 8 . placement of an internal stent possibly provides the rigidity to the ureter thereby recovering the hernia and urinary obstruction . indeed ureterosciatic hernia causing intermittent ureteral obstruction and producing significant morbidity should be repaired .", " our access to the tiotropium clinical trial database allowed us to undertake a thorough analysis of whether withdrawal of inhaled anticholinergics influenced the results observed with tiotropium on reducing copd exacerbations . there was a significantly reduced risk of an exacerbation in patients receiving tiotropium compared with those receiving placebo in the d group hr 95 confidence interval ci 0.83 0.770.90 and in the nd groups hr 95 ci 0.79 0.730.85 . the number of patients having at least one exacerbation and at least one exacerbation leading to hospitalization was reduced with tiotropium relative to placebo in both d and nd groups as reflected by lower rate ratios tables 2 and 3 . there was a significantly reduced risk of an exacerbation in patients receiving tiotropium compared with those receiving placebo in the d group hr 95 confidence interval ci 0.83 0.770.90 and in the nd groups hr 95 ci 0.79 0.730.85 . the number of patients having at least one exacerbation and at least one exacerbation leading to hospitalization was reduced with tiotropium relative to placebo in both d and nd groups as reflected by lower rate ratios tables 2 and 3 . the pooled analysis of 10 randomized double blind placebo controlled clinical trials involving 12163 patients with copd demonstrates that tiotropium was effective in reducing exacerbations in patients who did and also those who did not have inhaled anticholinergics discontinued upon randomization . in patients who did not discontinue anticholinergic therapy the risk reduction was 21 with tiotropium compared with placebo . thus withdrawal of inhaled anticholinergics upon entry into tiotropium trials did not appear to influence the effect of tiotropium on the clinically important patient outcome of exacerbations of copd . exacerbations are a significant component of the clinical course in copd.1516 furthermore as copd progresses exacerbations become more frequent.16 some investigators have suggested that more frequent exacerbations are associated with more rapid decline of fev1.1718 certainly exacerbations have profound effects on quality of life.19 for example sgrq scores have been shown to be decreased worsened below baseline for up to six months following an exacerbation.20 finally exacerbations are associated with significant mortality.21 more widespread clinical use of tiotropium in copd patients might predictably ameliorate the effects of recurrent exacerbations on the clinical course of the disease and impact the design of future clinical trials . in the case of the towards a revolution in copd health torch study this phenomenon led in effect to two comparisons ie withdrawal of inhaled corticosteroids compared with continuation of inhaled corticosteroids in patients previously taking these agents and introduction of inhaled corticosteroids compared with placebo in patients not previously taking inhaled corticosteroids . these concerns prompted a detailed retrospective analysis of data from torch.23 in this paper keene et al argued that a negative binomial model was the best approach to statistical analysis of exacerbation rates and that a similar reduction in exacerbations could be calculated regardless of whether or not subjects had discontinued inhaled corticosteroids at randomization . furthermore we have demonstrated a similar reduction in the number of exacerbations per patient year in those who continued and those who discontinued inhaled anticholinergic therapy upon randomization into these tiotropium clinical trials . this significant benefit argues that the clinical trial results in terms of the difference between tiotropium and placebo favor a positive effect from tiotropium rather than a negative effect from inhaled anticholinergic withdrawal in the placebo group . as well as demonstrating that tiotropium reduced exacerbations regardless of changes in prior therapy we were also able to demonstrate that tiotropium when compared with placebo improved health related quality of life as measured by sgrq regardless of whether or not patients had been taking inhaled anticholinergic therapy prior to randomization . we can speculate why withdrawal of inhaled anticholinergic therapy does not affect the outcome of placebo controlled clinical trials of tiotropium whereas withdrawal of inhaled corticosteroids seems to be problematic . the effect of ipratropium which is the short acting anticholinergic taken by many patients prior to entry into the tiotropium trials is well understood to be restricted to antimuscarinic smooth muscle relaxation and presumably wears off relatively quickly although there is some evidence that the effects of extended therapy with ipratropium persist longer than the conventional 68hour duration of acute bronchodilation.24 although considered a short acting bronchodilator ipratropium alone or in combination with albuterol has been shown to reduce exacerbations compared with albuterol alone.25 this observation suggests that one should consider whether a rebound effect ie an increase in exacerbation rate might be a consequence of ipratropium withdrawal . in summary we have demonstrated that tiotropium reduced exacerbations and hospitalizations in a large number of copd patients regardless of whether or not they discontinued inhaled anticholinergic therapy prior to randomization into the placebo controlled clinical trials . these findings strengthen the validity of conclusions previously reported from these clinical trials that treatment with tiotropium reduces exacerbations and that the beneficial effect is equally observed whether or not patients had previously received inhaled anticholinergic therapy .", " telepathology is defined as the practice of pathology at a distance transmitting macroscopic andor microscopic images via telecommunication links for 1 remote interpretations telediagnosis second opinions or consultations teleconsultation and educational purposes teleconferencing . with the widespread availability of imaging technology and telecommunication access to global expert pathologists telepathology has been shown to be applicable for i anatomical pathology including intra operative consultation frozen sections surgical pathology second opinions immunostains telecytology e.g. the first is static store and forward telepathology that involves the examination of pre captured still images transmitted via e mail or stored on a shared server . the second mode of telepathology involves dynamic live examination of images in real time employing video or robotic microscopy . with this infrastructure telepathology has been employed at upmc for over a decade to provide remote subspecialty expertise at local national and international sites . static image telepathology involves capturing storing and forwarding individual digital images or galleries of static images for remote diagnosis . advantages of this form of telepathology are the low cost involved vendor independence technical simplicity the fact that the recipient does not require special software to view images small manageable files are involved easy to retrieve send review store and share and that these systems are easy to maintain . however disadvantages of static telepathology relate to the fact that the consulting telepathologist has no remote control of the microscope or imaging device camera their interpretation is limited to only captured field of views the host capturing images needs to have some expertise acquiring images is labor intensive and may cause sampling error if the incorrect images are captured there is frequent lack of clarity with low power magnification images and not all still images are in focus . this first generation home grown static telepathology system has since been replaced by second generation dynamic robotic microscopy nikon coolscope streaming third generation hybrid rapid virtual microscopy trestle live viewing and most recently in 2009 with fourth generation wsi ultra rapid virtual microscopy mirax midi figure 1 . with better technology allowing pathologists to view entire slides at high resolution the performance of telepathology has improved . early and continued adoption of telepathology has provided invaluable experience with digital pathology improved workflow and accumulated resources facilitated funding for equipment it infrastructure and staffing within the transplant pathology division . using this system a technologist in the laboratory was able to email static images of concerning blood cells to a hematopathologist for interpretation figure 2 while in turn the hematopathologist could access the system and the entire stored differential of a patient remotely from their office computer . the remote consulting pathologist is usually in communication e.g. while many prior publications regarding telecytology have predominantly utilized static images in practice today most cytology laboratories that use telecytology employ video streaming . validation studies conducted in our cytopathology division using web based streaming have shown that adequacy assessment and diagnostic accuracy with telecytology are acceptable . these factors may explain in part why our cytopathologists only infrequently employ telecytology despite the fact the necessary equipment to perform telepathology for immediate on site evaluation of fine needle aspirations is available . cytopathologists took longer to review a cytology slide using telecytology 94 seconds than they did when examining the same slide with a conventional light microscope 70 seconds robotic real time dynamic telepathology differs from video microscopy because the telepathologist consultant is now actively involved in selecting fields on the glass slide to be viewed . pathology assistant these devices are expensive and because of their point to point network connectivity requirements i.e. high definition digital cameras and teleconferencing software are underway in an attempt to improve our macroscopic teleneuropathology capabilities figure 7 . however with the adoption of newer technology trestle scanner replaced the nikon coolscope and increased pathologist experience in 2007 to 2008 comparing 547 conventional frozen sections to 262 by telepathology there was acceptable concordance 78.2 between telepathology and conventional frozen sections . 2007 information technology infrastructure used to support intra institutional neuropathology frozen section telepathology gross teleneuropathology showing close up views of two portions of tissue submitted for frozen section from a glioblastoma multiforme tumor wsi telepathology systems are being increasingly employed for clinical education and research applications . furthermore pathologists maintain a close working relationship with histology to optimize slides for scanning e.g. users may also have to contend with long scan times especially for thick tissue sections and if high resolution images are desired e.g. this web based tool was designed to facilitate digital pathology second opinion consults especially for wsi . streamlined workflow as well as training of users has ensured prompt turn around time and buy in by institute pathologists . perhaps more importantly this automated system eliminates a person having to email or notify which scan filenames are associated with a case thereby removing the possibility of human error of assigning the wrong slide image to a case digital pathology consultation at upmc has spanned more than a decade . during this time all modes of telepathology have been successfully utilized to exploit our subspecialty expertise and to compete for pathology services . the practice of telepathology at our institution has evolved in concert with advances in technology which has become more cost effective . of note diagnostic accuracy and turnaround time telecytology has been accomplished largely using real time video streaming and for wsi of cytology slides the low volume of cases received for teleconsultation have been interpretable without the need for scanning slides with z stacking . early and continued adoption has promoted several digital pathology resources e.g. a key aspect of a successful digital teleconsultation program is integration of digital images including wsi into the laboratory information system lis and electronic health record . technological issues however are often easier to overcome than administrative contractual and legal challenges our institution is currently evaluating newer approaches such as grid technology open access forums and mobile solutions to determine how they can be leveraged to enhance telepathology at our institution .", " we also recently demonstrated that ih induced inflammatory changes of epididymal white adipose tissue ewat contributed to these outcomes . we also reported that in lean animals ewat exposed to ih became pathological behaving like excess fat in obesity as it exhibited increases in macrophage recruitment and secretion of il6 and tnf . therefore we assessed whether metabolic and vascular consequences induced by ih involved the proinflammatory tlr4nfb pathway activation . the insulin response was not affected in hypoxic tlr4 mice the response curve was almost superposable with those of the normoxic tlr4 animals figures 2c and 2d and not significantly different from the curve of normoxic c57bl6 animals figure 2a . there are some similarities with cardiometabolic complications due to obesity the latter resulting from inflammation involving tlr4 signaling . here we showed in nonobese c57bl6 mice that ih induced morphological and inflammatory remodeling of vascular and white adipose tissues as well as insulin resistance . these alterations were prevented in hypoxic tlr4deficient mice suggesting that ih induced cardiometabolic consequences involve tlr4 signaling mediated inflammation . indeed in the absence of additional factors such as obesity high fat diet and genetic vulnerability ih needs to be severe enough to induce measurable and reproducible vascular alterations especially in c57bl6 mice which are atheroresistant animals . adipose inflammation may have also contributed to lipolysis as we found an increased release of the inflammatory cytokines tnf and il6 from fat pads of hypoxic c57bl6 mice . this is again consistent with previous reports in lean apoe mice after 6 weeks of ih and more recently in 3t3l1 adipocytes exposed to fluctuating oxygen concentration . we found that both ih induced morphological and inflammatory alterations of ewat were prevented in tlr4deficient mice . there is growing evidence from studies using murine models of obesity that activation of the proinflammatory tlr4nfb pathway constitutes one mechanism that links inflammation and metabolic disorders 3032 . as observed in mice models of diet induced obesity 30 32 tlr4 deficiency prevented the enhanced release of tnf and il6 in our hypoxic mice . this strengthens the role of tlr4 in ih induced inflammation as well as the pathophysiological similarities with obesity that is a normal amount of fat under hypoxia behaving like excess fat in obesity . in the present study we observed increased release of tnf and il6 from ewat and decreased insulin sensitivity in hypoxic c57bl6 mice . both parameters were not impaired in tlr4deficient mice suggesting that tlr4 mediated inflammation was involved in this metabolic consequence . given the role of tlr4 in adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance and the relationship between adipose tissue inflammation insulin resistance and vascular dysfunction 12 47 the beneficial effect of tlr4 deficiency on arterial remodeling could be explained by the prevention of adipose inflammation and insulin resistance . a recent study also identified tlr4 signaling pathway as a direct key mediator of vascular inflammation and impairment of endothelial insulin signaling in the setting of obesity . the direct effect on vasculature could even be predominant as tlr4 deficiency prevented atherosclerosis in ldlr mice with no effect on adipose tissue inflammation and whole body insulin sensitivity . we showed in nonobese c57bl6 mice that ih induced morphological and inflammatory remodeling of aorta and epididymal white adipose tissue as well as insulin resistance . these alterations were prevented in tlr4deficient mice suggesting that ih induced cardiometabolic consequences involved inflammation mediated by tlr4 signaling .", " it seems ada is an index for cellular immunity and previous studies have proved its value in tb diagnosis even for assessing tb effusions . the level of ada in sputum and serum was used for diagnosis of tb and it was monitored during tb treatment . the goal of this study is to assess the diagnostic value and cut off point of serum ada levels in pulmonary tb patients . the average of serum ada in tb patients group and control group was 20.88 5.97 and 10.69 2.98 respectively . in this study serum ada level was an appropriate index for diagnosing smear positive tb . therefore serum ada could be also used for diagnosis of pulmonary tb . hence for suspicious cases of tb increased levels of ada could facilitate diagnosis . diagnostic value of serum ada in pulmonary tb has been assessed only in few numbers of studies . in agarwal s study ada level was 15.3 0.23 in healthy people 19 0.68 in non pulmonary tb cases and 38.48 1.56 in pulmonary tb patients . in rasolinejad s study serum ada level was 21.51 in pulmonary tb patients and 11.47 in healthy people in cut off point of 14.5 u u l in negative smear and negative tuberculin patients 33.52 15.22 in smear positive and purified protein derivative ppd positive patients and 16.5 3.18 in volunteer healthy people . according to this study serum ada level is proposed as a proper index for tb diagnosis in a cut off point of 14 its sensitivity and specificity are calculated as 92.7 and 88.1 respectively .", " androgen deprivation therapy adt by bilateral orchiectomy or gonadotropin releasing hormone analogs with or without antiandrogens is indicated as front line treatment in metastatic prostate cancer as well as in the adjuvant setting following radical prostatectomy with nodal metastasis or radiation therapy and occasionally in patients with localized disease.1 adt has influence on many metabolic pathways but the most common side effect is reduction of bone density.26 prostate cancer usually spreads to the bone in metastatic disease and treatment with intravenous bisphosphonates is commonly prescribed at this stage in order to reduce skeletal related events.78 loss of bmd correlates with the duration of adt but is more pronounced during the first year of therapy.710 men initiating adt are recommended to have an assessment of risk factors for osteoporosis calcium and vitamin d intake lifestyle modifications and baseline and serial bmd assessment while on adt along with bisphosphonate therapy.1 there is evidence that loss of bmd is a strong predictor of fracture risk.11 treatment with bisphosphonates used to prevent osteoporotic fractures has been shown to increase bone mineral density bmd.12 although the national comprehensive cancer network and american society of clinical oncology guidelines propose baseline bmd assessment and bisphosphonate therapy there has been no systematic review of the utilization of these interventions by practicing physicians in the community . the one sided exact binomial test of proportion was used to determine if physician compliance with serial bmd assessment and bisphosphonate treatment in patients undergoing adt is consistently 80 . further logistic regression analysis was also done to explore the relationship between history of bone fractures and bisphosphonate treatment age race tumor stage at diagnosis and duration of adt . the age group race t stage and geographic distribution are shown in table 1 and for every covariate age race t stage and geographic location the percentage of bd utilization and parenteral bisphosphonate administration was markedly low . in our study 8.8 n2707 of subjects on adt received bd assessments without ever receiving intravenous bisphosphonates . three percent n931 of the cases on adt received bisphosphonate treatment without ever receiving a bd assessment . a compliance rate of nearly 1.0 0.9 those subjects receiving both bd to screen for bone loss and preventive bisphosphonate therapy was well below the expected rate of 80 table 2 . men diagnosed at later stages of disease t2t4 were more likely to receive bisphosphonate treatment than men diagnosed at earlier stages t0t1 table 1 . men with prostate cancer in the northwest and south regions were less likely to receive bd and bisphosphonates than men in the west region table 1 . when controlling for age a continuous variable bisphosphonate treatment a dichotomous variable non white race a dichotomous variable with white race as the reference group tumor stage a dichotomous variable with t4 stage as the reference group and duration of adt a continuous variable an association between length of therapy and history of bone fractures was found . in our study 8.8 n2707 of subjects on adt received bd assessments without ever receiving intravenous bisphosphonates . three percent n931 of the cases on adt received bisphosphonate treatment without ever receiving a bd assessment . a compliance rate of nearly 1.0 0.9 those subjects receiving both bd to screen for bone loss and preventive bisphosphonate therapy was well below the expected rate of 80 table 2 . men with prostate cancer in the northwest and south regions were less likely to receive bd and bisphosphonates than men in the west region table 1 . adt has been shown to reduce disease progression and increase survival in subjects with prostate cancer.22 bmd loss and osteoporosis is one of the main adverse effects of adt in this population.2623 in this study only a small proportion of prostate cancer patients on adt were evaluated for bone loss and an even smaller proportion ever received intravenous bisphosphonate therapy . in randomized studies bisphosphonate therapy including pamidronate zoledronic acid or alendronate has been shown to improve bmd and decrease markers of bone metabolism in men on adt.4572029 this community level study supports evidence that bd utilization and bisphosphonate therapy reduce fracture risk in men with prostate cancer receiving adt . most evidence supporting the use of bisphosphonates for prevention of adt related bone loss in men with prostate cancer is derived from studies evaluating intravenous bisphosphonates.452021 this is due to the lack of data available to analyze oral bisphosphonate use in large population studies . however due to lack of patient adherence oral bisphosphonates have not been the preferred treatment over intravenous bisphosphonates in this patient population so likely did not significantly affect the outcome.1415 our study re emphasizes the importance of using bd measures to evaluate skeletal integrity and prevent osteoporosis with the utilization of bisphosphonates among patients who are on adt .", " human wild type and mutant fto protein production was carried out as previously described 32 . this method was modified and optimized to assay fto as previously described

substrate recognition lid of the protein fig . we also tested the enzymatic activity of several other variants representing the different regions of fto p5l v94i i148r m223v e234d a241 t a405v i492v and v493f fig . none of these variants all of which are located in less conserved positions had any significant impact on enzymatic activity fig . although snps in intron 1 of fto are unequivocally associated with adiposity in multiple populations there is still no evidence that those snps influence the expression or splicing of fto itself . fto is located adjacent to other genes the expression or function of which could conceivably influence energy balance 103638 . given that information it is reasonable to speculate that loss of function mutations in fto might be more common in lean rather than obese humans . to test this hypothesis we sequenced fto in a large number of lean and obese subjects and found that 1 nonsynonymous mutations were equally common in both the obese and lean cohorts and 2 heterozygous mutations that severely impaired enzymatic activity of fto were found in both lean and obese individuals with no other obvious major clinical phenotypes . if we had considered fto to be an obesity gene and sequenced only obese subjects the finding of loss of function mutations would have been misleading . from our human genetic data we can conclude that heterozygosity for a severely dysfunctional fto allele is compatible with being either lean or obese in humans . our studies have brought new insights into aspects of the structure function relationship of the human fto enzyme . as predicted we found that the arginine at position 322 is essential for the catalytic activity of human fto and we have made similar observations for r316q 32 . perhaps more interestingly we have demonstrated that mutation of r96 to histidine in human fto produces an enzyme that is capable of some basal conversion of 2og to succinate but is insensitive to the effects of 3methylthymidine . first we do not know what the true natural primary substrates of fto is are and it is entirely possible that mutations that affect fto s actions on this elusive substrate will not necessarily impair the uncoupled reaction . this could potentially be of relevance to v493f a cooh terminal mutation that was found only in the obese population but was found in four different individuals fig . second although nonsynonymous variants elsewhere in the molecule are found equally in obese and lean subjects eight such variants found in the cooh terminus were detected in obese subjects and only two in lean fig .", " chairman of the department of neurology at oregon health science university ohsu said what we need in ms are measures that are quick easy accurate and sensitive to change both worsening and improvement and are understandable to clinicians gait and balance measures have the potential to meet these requirements . he emphasized the need for communication between neurologists and others caring for people with ms and conducting clinical trials and nonneurologists engaged in developing and testing measures of gait and balance . self reported measures of gait and balance can ascertain patients quality of life balance confidence fear of falling circumstances surrounding fall events and other important information that can not be determined by clinical testing or physical instrumentation . pt a neurologist from ohsu discussed the activities specific balance confidence abc scale and the dizziness handicap inventory dhi the two self administered measures of balance measures frequently used in people with ms which although originally developed for other populations have high test retest reliability in people with ms abc 0.92 dhi 0.90 . self administered measures of gait and balance in ms provide insight into patients perspectives about their abilities are inexpensive to administer most have minimal floor and ceiling effects and identify who is at increased risk for falls . however because these measures do not provide information on neuroanatomical biomechanical environmental or personal factors contributing to gait and balance impairment in ms or shed light on the impact of activity limitations on an individual s participation or quality of life they give limited guidance for intervention . the speakers recommended using these measures in addition to clinician administered measures for screening people with ms for gait dysfunction imbalance and fall risk and as outcome measures in trials of interventions expected to have a positive impact on mobility and quality of life . despite their great potential currently integration of novel instrumented measures of gait and balance into ms clinical practice and research is limited by lack of test protocol and device standardization . demonstrated relationships between instrumented walking velocity measures and dti and mt indices of the spinal cord in ms . new mri techniques together with novel instrumented measures of gait and balance may also allow us to define the anatomic substrates of disability and to design specific innovative rehabilitation strategies for people with ms based on the relationships between structure and function . the panelists concurred that measures of gait and balance dysfunction should be used throughout the course of mscurrently available simple clinician and self administered measures are recommended for screening for imbalance gait dysfunction and fall risk self administered measures are important for capturing the patients perspective of their abilities and the effectiveness of interventions more complex clinician administered measures and instrumented measures are recommended to guide the selection and development of tailored interventions for walking and balance problems in people with ms and for precise monitoring of change in clinical trials remaining critical research needs are to identify and standardize the most scientifically valid and practically useful measures to capture the continuum of gait and balance deficits in ms and to understand the relationships between these measures.abstracts of posters of primary research presented at this symposium were published in winter 2011 international journal of ms care . measures of gait and balance dysfunction should be used

to analyze the change in the degree of severity in bolton discrepancy before and after the hypothetical extraction and to identify any incidence in bolton discrepancy taking place after hypothetical extractions in normal or control groups without any bolton discrepancy . subsequent to calculated pre treatment bolton s value bv hypothetical extraction of four premolars was accomplished by substituting these combinations were 1 removal of all first premolars 2 removal of all second premolars 3 removal of upper first and lower second premolars 4 removal of upper second and lower first premolars . finally the pre treatment and postextraction tooth size ratios and bv were evaluated statistically by the use of paired student s t test . incidence of tooth discrepancy in different

91.3if overall ratio is 91.3 if overall ratio exceeds 91.3 if overall ratio is 91.3 similar proforma was followed for different extraction patterns as mentioned earlier . in the present study no statistical significant difference is seen between findings indicating that the tooth discrepancy is not related to jaw relationship . there was a maximum increase in the mean bv following all first premolar extraction and minimum increase was noticed in all second premolar extraction indicating that again following all first premolar premolar extractions mandibular discrepancy is increasing significantly and this is in confirmation with the with study done by saatci and yukay10 showing that all second premolar extraction is favorable compared to other patterns of premolar extraction especially with all first premolar extraction in this group . it was also noted in the study that if we extract premolars of equal mesiodistal dimension from upper and lower dental arches more severe tooth size discrepancies were created when compared with the removal of greater mandibular premolars . it appeared that because most discrepancies created by extraction occurred as a mandibular excess removal of the mandibular second premolars which usually has wider mesio distal dimensions was likely to result in discrepancies of a smaller size than the mandibular first premolars.11 therefore this result is in agreement with the opinion expressed by bolton that the removal of mandibular second premolars often crates the potential for a better occlusion than the removal of the first premolars as the mandibular molars are allowed more mesial movement . the results obtained in this study suggest a new point of view to the question of which teeth to extract when evaluated from a tooth size discrepancy12 standpoint only . there was a significant difference in the anterior ratio between the present study and bolton s sample and the overall ratio did not show any significant differencea specific malocclusion group was not shown to contain a larger percentage of tooth size discrepanciesthe results obtained in the present study are in agreement with the removal of all second premolars

fabq and pictorial fear of activity scale cervical pfacts c and are used to assess fear of movement related pain re injury in patients with low back and neck pain7 . in a study on patients with neck

performed to evaluate and compare the characteristics of pain kinesiophobia and quality of life in patients with low back and neck pain . pain duration was longer body weight was greater kinesiophobia was more severe and pain and physical activity domains of quality of life scales were worse in the low back pain group without any difference in pain severity or other pain characteristics between the groups . many studies have examined fear of movement related pain re injury in patients with low back and neck pain . studies that assessed patients with chronic low back and neck pain reported that pain and disability scores increased as the fear of movement related pain increased2021222324 . wilgen et al.21 used the tsk and pain disability index to evaluate fear of movement and disability in patients with low back pain . a relationship between kinesiophobia disability and quality of life in patients with chronic low back pain gheldof et al . according to our findings although the severity of pain was moderate and similar in the low back and neck pain groups kinesiophobia was more severe in the low back pain group . the decreased physical activity levels in the low back pain group derived from quality of life assessment also support this movement related fear patients with lumbar problems are thought to limit physical activities that require great muscle effort such as walking because of kinesiophobia . it is well known that there is an interaction between pain and quality of life at different levels in patients with low back and neck pain . the longer duration of pain and higher levels of kinesiophobia in the low back pain group may also be associated with lower quality of life . the primary goal of treatment in patients with low back and neck pain is to reduce the severity of pain however our findings indicate that the differences observed between the groups in terms of pain perception body weight kinesiophobia and physical activity should be taken into consideration when planning preventive and curative physical therapy programs for patients with low back and neck pain . therefore the lack of evaluation for the causes of kinesiophobia in patients with neck and low back pain is a limitation of our study .", " the dwell time was calculated in a different way the catheter was created via virtual tomography the length of the catheter and the location of the source in it were the same as those in the 3d method but the dose was specified to 1 cm from the catheter . the dwell time calculated in the 2d method was transferred to the treatment plan performed based on the 3d imaging method . in the case of 100 ptv the p value was 0.0001 indicating that the statistical differences between the 3d and the 2d methods are significant . basic measures of outcomes ptv100 in the 3d and the 2d methods in cases where ptv was 85 just as when ptv was 100 the p value was 0.0001 which means that the statistical differences between the 3d method and the 2d method are significant . the standard deviation is not significantly higher about 0.02 gy for the 2d method than for the 3d method when the dose was used on the spinal cord every 2 cm . in cases where ptv was 85 just as when ptv was 100 the p value was 0.0001 which means that the statistical differences between the 3d method and the 2d method are significant . when the dose was used on the spinal cord every 2 cm the p value was 0.009 implying significant statistical differences between the 3d method and the 2d method . the standard deviation is not significantly higher about 0.02 gy for the 2d method than for the 3d method when the dose was used on the spinal cord every 2 cm . with the 2d method the dose to critical organs often exceeds the limit values and simultaneously disqualifies the treatment plan . in the 3d method we can precisely determine the position of the tumor and critical organs which allows us to optimize the treatment and limit the dose to critical organs . figure 4 provides a comparison between the dvh for both methods where it can be seen that a much better coverage of ptv dose is required in the 3d method than the 2d . applying treatment with the 3d method there is a possibility for dose optimization decreasing the dose for the critical organs and as a result reducing the toxic effects of treatment on healthy tissue 6 12 13 . the 3d method based on dynamic imaging the conclusions from the analysis and interpretation of the results of the research are as follows reference doses with 100 coverage of the ptv in treatment applied with the 3d method are 31 higher than when applied with the 2d method.determination of the target area and the area of critical tissues is possible to a far greater extent by the application of the 3d method than is the case with the 2d method . the former method allows for the administration of high therapeutic doses while minimizing any impact on critical organs.in the 2d method application of dose is specified 1 cm from the catheter . determination of the target area and the area of critical tissues is possible to a far greater extent by the application of the 3d method than is the case with the 2d method . in the 2d method such problems do not occur in the 3d method which allows for uniformity of high doses .", " the use of computer navigation has been shown to improve the accuracy of femoral component placement thus reducing the likelihood of preparatory error . considering the predisposition to technical error early on in hip resurfacing it would be advantageous for the surgeon as a trainee to utilize computer based methods to optimize the surgical technique and solidify component implantation methodology . thus there may be a role for computer navigation as a training device for novice surgeons particularly in the context of learning challenging orthopedic procedures to improve component implantation once navigation is discontinued . the aim of this study was to examine whether femoral component alignment improved with conventional mechanical guidewire jig following experience with using imageless computer navigation in hsa . we retrospectively compared the first 17 cohort 1 and last 9 cohort 2 hip resurfacings performed using the conventional lateral pin guidewire alignment jig figure 1 . cohort 1 was the surgeon s initial 17 cases of hip resurfacing which were performed prior to our center s acquisition of an imageless computer navigation system vectorvision sr brainlab feldkirchen germany . thus the hip resurfacings in cohort 2 were performed after the surgeon had gained significant experience with using imageless computer navigation figure 2 . box and whisker plot of stem shaft angle accuracy for the two conventional jig cohorts negative values denote relative varus and positive values denote relative valgus box and whisker plot of stem neck angle accuracy of the two conventional jig cohorts negative values denote retroversion and positive values denote anteversion comparison of the accuracy of implant positioning using a conventional jig between the pre and post navigation cohorts hip resurfacing provides a viable bone conserving option for a young active patient with end stage hip disease . in this study we found that the cohort of hip resurfacing patients following experience using computer navigation cohort 2 was more accurate and showed less variance in component positioning . it has been well documented that computer assisted surgery by way of imageless navigation functions to curtail femoral implant malalignment in hip resurfacing . in order for surgeons new to hip resurfacing to perform optimally using conventional instrumentation it may be necessary to first train using computer assisted methods in order to enhance both surgical technique and component insertion protocol . thus this study looked to establish whether femoral component implantation accuracy utilizing a conventional guidewire alignment jig improves following the use of imageless computer navigation in hsa . fellowship trained staff surgeons with experience in hip resurfacing 75 cases exhibited a greater scatter of insertion angles when using conventional instrumentation than less experienced residents using imageless navigation as a surgical aid . the results of this study may not be extrapolated to other conventional guidewire alignment jigs in hip resurfacing . in this study all femoral components implanted with a manual jig after acquiring experience using imageless navigation achieved the desired minimum of 10 of valgus relative to the native nsa and all were considered to have neutral sna angles . often the native anatomy of the end stage hip disease patient is distorted with osteophytes and remodeled bone which can prove problematic when using a manual jig as alignment and positioning depend largely on a visual assessment of the local anatomy for guidewire placement . this finding is supported by a systematic review by saithna and dekker looking at the influence of computer navigation in hip resurfacing training in which they concluded that there exists minimal evidence to support concerns regarding the detrimental impact of computer navigation on trainee learning and subsequent performance in hip resurfacing . the study demonstrates that femoral component placement utilizing conventional instrumentation may be more accurate following experience using imageless computer navigation . the success of hip resurfacing is particularly sensitive to surgical technique and component alignment training with computer navigation early in the learning curve may help optimize the subsequent use of conventional hip resurfacing instrumentation .", " continuous efforts by researchers and constant addition of literature minimized the aura of one of the deadliest disease that is oral malignant melanoma omm . the mucosal melanoma was discussed first by weber in germany and later on the valuable information of head and neck mucosal melanoma was reported by lincoln in 1885 . unlike omm there is a marked variation in the etiology and incidence rate of generalized cutaneous melanomas . around 50 of mucosal melanomas affect the head and neck region almost representing approximately 9 of all malignant head and neck tumors . the etiology of mucosal melanoma differs from its cutaneous counterpart as there is no direct role of uv radiation . hence the pigmented lesions of oral cavity which does not possess clinical specificity need to be carefully evaluated for possibility of omm . differential diagnosis include smoke related melanosis drug pigments physiologic or racial pigmentation melanotic macule kaposi s sarcoma nevus or melanoacanthoma chronic leukemic etc . among the oral melanomas hard palate and maxillary gingiva we report a case of omm in a 45year old female patient who is conscious about the discoloration and growing bulk over mandibular anterior mucosa . clinical photograph showing bluish black irregularly spreading growth extending from mandibular left second premolar to right first premolar in microscopic examination the

and e 10 h and e stained section reveals pigmented cells with abnormal mitosis h and e 10 immunohistochemistry stained slide shows positive expression ihc 10 immunohistochemistry stained slide shows cytoplasmic positivity by the melanocytes ihc 40 the oral mucosal melanoma is a rare entity with incidence rates of 1 of all melanomas and among head neck tumors the head and neck mucosal melanomas accounted for 0.8 of all melanomas and 8 of head and neck melanomas . majority of patients show history of preexisting oral pigmentation before the diagnosis of oral melanoma . may be helpful to clinicians that suggests demonstration of melanoma in the oral mucosa presence of junctional activity and inability to demonstrate extra oral primary melanoma .", " urinary tract infection uti is one of the most common clinical syndromes encountered in general and gynecological practices . in almost all cases of uti empirical antimicrobial treatment initiates before the laboratory results of urine culture are available thus antibiotic resistance may increase in uropathogens due to frequent use of antibiotics . the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in patients with uti is increasing and can vary according to geographical and regional location . for this reason knowledge of the etiological agents of utis and their antimicrobial resistance patterns in specific geographical locations may aid clinicians in choosing the appropriate antimicrobial empirical treatment . the literature on prevalence of uti among females in lucknow was scarce in recent decades thereby the present study was undertaken to find out the prevalence of uti and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of commonly used antibiotics among females in lucknow . all females aged 15 years and above attending the respective outpatient departments clinically suspected for uti were selected for the purpose of the study during the study period . thirty two 51.61 of 62 females aged between 25 and 34 years and 15 46.87 of 32 females aged between 15 and 24 years were identified with uti . ten 40.0 of 25 females between 35 and 44 years and 6 30.0 of 20 females above 45 years of age had uti . fifty six 44.09 homemakers and six 66.67 students were identified with uti table 1 . ten 50.0 of 20 pregnant females had uti compared to 53 44.53 of 119 nonpregnant females . antibiotic susceptibility trends observed among the identified bacterial species causing urinary tract infection antibiotic susceptibility trends observed among the identified bacterial species causing urinary tract infection it is stated that uti is predominantly a disease of the females due to a short urethra and proximity to vestibule and the anal opening . forty five 46.87 out of 96 urban respondents and 18 41.86 out of 43 rural respondents were identified with uti in our study . in our study the prevalence of uti was higher among the females aged between 15 and 44 years compared to those aged above 45 years of age . a higher percentage of literate females were identified with uti compared to the literate ones in the current study . these findings agree with other recent indian reports which have indicated that gram negative bacteria mostly e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae are the most common pathogens isolated in patients with uti table 3 . distribution of pathogens isolated among uti patients the most effective antibiotic for e. coli in this study observed was nitrofurantoin followed by amoxicillin nalidixic acid and co trimaxazole .", " cytokines in immune responses to infection are often classified as immuno stimulating tumour suppressing th1type cytokines and immuno inhibitory tumour promoting th2type cytokines . qualitative and quantitative analyses of cytokine profiles have been used to characterize the immune response in hpv related cin . generally a shift from a th1type to a th2type cytokine response was observed when healthy controls or women with low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions lsil were compared with cases of high grade sil hsil or cervical carcinoma 7 11 17 19 . we previously observed manifestation of a th2type cytokine pattern in plasma of hr hpv positive women during carcinogenesis of cervical cancer at the stage of cin iii . these results let us assume that significant changes in the immunocompetence of circulating leukocytes are involved in the development from cervical dysplasia to cervical cancer . in the present study we used whole blood cultures from hr hpv negative controls hr hpv positive women without cervical dysplasia and hr hpv positive patients with different grades of cin and cervical cancer to investigate changes in immunocompetence expressed in the capacity of circulating leukocytes to release cytokines in response to a mitogenic challenge . of interest were the effect of hr hpv infection without clinical manifestations the special position of cin iii with a th2type cytokine response and a possible revival of inflammatory cytokine activity in cervical carcinoma . for calculations of the latter two cytokines values of maximal release was observed between the two groups of women without dysplasia with the exception of il12 all investigated cytokines were significantly increased in hr hpv positive women . in hr hpv infected women release of th1type cytokines ifn tnf and il2 decreased with increasing grades of cin . in order to characterize a possible th1type th2type shift we calculated the ratios of th1type cytokines il12 ifn tnf and il2 to th2type cytokines il10 and il4 in hr hpv infected groups . in order to characterize a possible th1 type cytokine pattern after establishment of an invasive carcinoma we compared cytokine levels in pha stimulated blood cultures of patients with invasive carcinoma with levels in hr hpv positive women without dysplasia . the significant increase in th1type as well as th2type cytokines in our hr hpv positive women with normal histology suggests viral activation of the systemic cytokine network and induction of cell mediated immunity after initial hr hpv infection table 2 . to our knowledge this is the first description of activation of the systemic cytokine network in hr hpv positive women without dysplasia . observed decreased ifn and il2 and increased il4 and il10 in mitogen stimulated cultures of pbmcs isolated from women with cin iii when compared with cultures from hr hpv negative women . our study describes for the first time changes in the cytokine pattern within the cytokine network developing from hr hpv infection without clinical symptoms via cin ii and cin iii to carcinoma . our hr hpv positive women with normal histology demonstrated significantly increased th1 and th2type cytokine release with the exception of il12 which was low . values of ifn and il12 release in cervical carcinoma are comparable to data obtained after initial hr hpv infection all other cytokine levels remain significantly lower . this reaction is partly comparable to the inflammatory reaction on the initial hr hpv infection as expressed in the ratio s of ifn and il12 in figures 3a 3b 3e 3f . studied t cell responses to hpv 16 oncoproteins by measuring ifn release in women with low and high grade cin and cervical carcinoma and found higher levels of t cell responses in carcinoma patients compared to high grade cin cases . it was our goal to study changes in the cytokine network in blood of hr hpv infected women at various stages of cin upto onset of cervical carcinoma . most studies dealing with cytokine patterns in hr hpv related cervical neoplasia and cancer concentrate on infections with hpv 16 the most frequently observed oncogenic hpv type in caucasian population . the small sample size of our study groups did not allow us to correlate cytokine response with specific hr hpv types . further studies with enlarged numbers of participants are needed to investigate the individual impact of different hr hpv types on the cytokine network . our study suggests that infection with hr hpv in women without cervical dysplasia induces activation of the cytokine network . our results confirm and expand our earlier observations on circulating cytokines significant changes in the kinetics of cytokine release to a th2type immune response in blood of women with cervical dysplasia occur progressively from cin ii to cin iii .", " in addition co has been found to be an important regulator in the suppression of inflammatory cytokines and mediators including inducible nitric oxide synthase inos tnf and il6 17 18 as well as induction of the anti inflammatory cytokine il10 . to date there are no reports regarding the effects of co mediated il10 production on the regulation of tn c mediated inflammation . furthermore it has been reported that the generation of endogenous co was necessary for il10dependent inhibition of tnf expression . in the present study we investigated the effects of co on tn c mediated inflammation . to confirm the effects of co on tn c meditated inflammation cells were pretreated with or without corm2 or rucl3 negative control for corm2 and then stimulated with or without lps . interestingly corm2 significantly downregulated lps induced tn c as well as proinflammatory cytokines expression whereas rucl3 did not have any effect figures 2e 2f 2g and 2h . to confirm the effects of co consistently co gas dramatically reduced lps stimulated expression of tn c figure 2i as well as tnf figure 2j and il6 figure 2k . to further confirm the effects of co on lps induced tn c expression and proinflammatory cytokines mouse peritoneal macrophages were pretreated with corm2 at various concentrations and incubated with lps . we found that corm2 dramatically decreased lps induced tn c figure 3a and its downstream cytokines figure 3b . in our study we investigated the effects of co on tn c induced proinflammatory cytokines expression and the expression of anti inflammatory il10 in raw 264.7 and peritoneal macrophages . corm2 significantly and dose dependently induced the expression of il10 in lps stimulated macrophages figures 4a and 4b . furthermore treatment with co gas significantly increased levels of il10 figure 4c in lps stimulated raw 264.7 macrophages . these observations indicate that the anti inflammatory effects of co are mediated by il10 in lps stimulated macrophages . to confirm the function of co induced il10 on tn c mediated inflammation macrophages were transfected with il10 sirna and treated with corm2 prior to lps stimulation . based on these results we conclude that co induced il10 inhibits tn c mediated inflammation . furthermore application of exogenous co inhibits lps induced production of tnf while it increases il10 production in vitro and in vivo . for 2 h. interestingly corm2 significantly decreased tn c figure 5a tnf and il6 mrna expression figure 5b and protein secretion figure 5c and simultaneously increased il10 expression figure 5d in liver tissue from lps induced endotoxemic mice . also the levels of il10 figure 5e were increased and reversely tn c levels figure 5f were decreased in the serum of mice treated with corm2 . therefore the results from in vivo experiments suggest that co inhibited tn c and its downstream inflammatory cytokines whereby il10 expression was upregulated in a septic mice model . interestingly corm2 significantly decreased lps induced tn c and proinflammatory cytokines production in vitro and in vivo . similarly pretreatment with co gas significantly decreased lps stimulated tn c and cytokines production in macrophages supporting the direct effects of co on tn c mediated inflammation . these results confirm that co inhibits lps mediated tn c and proinflammatory cytokines production . furthermore il10 sirna significantly reversed the effects of corm2 on tn c and proinflammatory cytokines production whereas tn c sirna significantly decreased proinflammatory gene expression levels without having an effect on co mediated il10 expression . in summary we identified that co induced il10 was involved in the inhibition of tlr4 signaling dependent tn c expression and thus inhibited the inflammatory response in vitro and in vivo .", " it was found that the ratios of cd4cd25treg th17 cells and cd4cd25treg th1 cells were significantly decreased in t2 dm patients . within the past few years many clinical studies have been focusing on the association of treg with proinflammatory and immunosuppressive cytokines in t2 dm

eventually this meta analysis included 91 articles involving 138 case control studies of 5642 t2 dm patients and 7378 healthy controls 13 for il6 3446 22 for tgf 23 4767 7 for tnf 3436 38 45 68 69 6 for cd4cd25foxp3treg 7075 15 for il10 7690 18 for cd4cd25treg 70 72 74 75 91104 and 10 for il17 105114 . t2 dm patients had significantly increased levels of serum il6 smd 1.28 95 ci 0.73 to 1.83 p 0.001 figure 2 tgf smd 2.88 95 ci 2.37 to 3.40 p 0.001 figure 3 and tnf smd 1.56 95 ci 1.10 to 2.02 p 0.001 figure 4 but significantly decreased the percentage of cd4cd25foxp3treg smd 0.47 95 ci 0.72 to 0.23 p 0.001 figure 5 and the level of serum il10 smd 1.37 95 ci 2.32 to 0.42 p 0.005 figure 6 . as shown in figures 28 both t2 dm patients with complication and the patients without complication had significantly increased levels of serum il6 figure 2 tgf figure 3 and tnf figure 4 while not significant changes were found in the percentage of peripheral cd4cd25treg figure 7 and il17 figure 8 . in this study we found that the patients with t2 dm had increased serum levels of il6 tgf and tnf but decreased percentage of peripheral cd4cd25foxp3treg and serum il10 level . in the present meta analysis of t2 dm patients increased levels of serum il6 tgf and tnf coexisted with decreased levels of il10 and decreased percentage of cd4cd25foxp3treg . t2 dm patients have elevated serum levels of il6 il1 and tgf the cytokines known to induce th17 differentiation . enhanced production of il6 and tnf and decreased levels of serum il10 that occurred in t2 dm patients may suppress treg cells and ratios of treg to th17 and th1 cells 132 133 . although changes of serum levels of il17 were not significant in this meta analysis of t2 dm patients versus controls il17 may be a clue to the possible involvement of th17 cells in t2 dm pathogenesis . lastly th17 cells might be together with innate cells a primary source of the increased il6 levels and might be actively orchestrating the immunity driven chronic inflammation of target tissues and organs in t2 dm . the percentage of treg cells and levels of cytokines in t2 dm may also depend on ethnicity sex weight age and disease duration . in summary t2 dm patients and the patients with diabetic complication have decreased immunosuppressive cd4cd25foxp3treg cells and increased proinflammatory il10 tgf and tnf.", " vitamin c has symptom relieving effects on the exacerbation of copd.6 in addition it improves pulmonary function in copd.78 moreover a recent animal study has revealed that supplementation with vitamin c not only prevents the development of copd but also restores the lung function in copd subjects.9 the korea national health and nutrition examination survey knhanes is a large scale survey containing a vast amount of data on demographics underlying disease smoking history lung function and nutritional status conducted by the korean centers for disease control and prevention kcdc . therefore the results obtained by this survey using complex analysis can be generalized to the entire korean general population.1011 thus knhanes is the best tool for defining and confirming the correlation between vitamin c intake and copd . therefore in this study we aimed to confirm the protective effects of vitamin c against copd in the korean general population using knhanes data . the prevalence of copd according to smoking history and the amount of vitamin c ingested was compared using the chi square test . the prevalence of copd according to smoking history and the amount of vitamin c ingested was compared using the chi square test . among never smokers the prevalence of copd was 7.9 and the prevalence increased according to the increase in the amount smoked 16.7 in light smokers 24.2 in medium smokers we compared the nutritional status assessed by the self reported questionnaire between the non copd and copd group . the prevalence of copd was positively correlated with the amount of smoking and negatively correlated with the amount of vitamin c ingested . in light smokers the prevalence of copd in subjects with vitamin c intake in q1 24.7 was significantly higher than that in subjects whose vitamin c intake fell in q4 7.0 p0.002 . in heavy smokers the prevalence of copd in subjects with q1 63.0 and q2 56.4 vitamin c intakes was significantly higher than that in subjects with q3 29.5 and q4 32.6 vitamin c intakes p0.015 . in addition the prevalence of copd in heavy smokers with vitamin c intake in q3 29.5 was lower than that in medium smokers with q1 vitamin c intake 36.8 figure 1 . sex age resident district type of residence household income educational level occupation smoking history and amount of retinol intake and vitamin c intake were significant risk factors for copd in the univariate analysis . in the multivariate analysis sex age smoking history and amount of vitamin c intake were independent risk factors for copd . the amount of vitamin c intake was a preventative factor for copd independent of sex age and even smoking history or 0.998 95 ci 0.9960.999 p0.001 . we classified the subjects according to smoking history and subclassified them according to the amount of vitamin c ingested and confirmed that the amount of vitamin c is an independent preventative factor for copd when adjusted for age and sex . in light smokers vitamin c intake in q4 was protective against copd compared to vitamin c intake in q2 . the prevalence of copd was positively correlated with the amount of smoking and negatively correlated with the amount of vitamin c ingested . in light smokers the prevalence of copd in subjects with vitamin c intake in q1 24.7 was significantly higher than that in subjects whose vitamin c intake fell in q4 7.0 p0.002 . in heavy smokers the prevalence of copd in subjects with q1 63.0 and q2 56.4 vitamin c intakes was significantly higher than that in subjects with q3 29.5 and q4 32.6 vitamin c intakes p0.015 . in addition the prevalence of copd in heavy smokers with vitamin c intake in q3 29.5 was lower than that in medium smokers with q1 vitamin c intake 36.8 figure 1 . sex age resident district type of residence household income educational level occupation smoking history and amount of retinol intake and vitamin c intake were significant risk factors for copd in the univariate analysis . in the multivariate analysis sex age smoking history and amount of vitamin c intake were independent risk factors for copd . the amount of vitamin c intake was a preventative factor for copd independent of sex age and even smoking history or 0.998 95 ci 0.9960.999 p0.001 . we classified the subjects according to smoking history and subclassified them according to the amount of vitamin c ingested and confirmed that the amount of vitamin c is an independent preventative factor for copd when adjusted for age and sex . in light smokers vitamin c intake in q4 was protective against copd compared to vitamin c intake in q2 . this large scale national study suggests that dietary vitamin c intake is protective against copd independent of smoking history in the korean general population .", " the association between smoking and increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus type 2 dm has been well documented 5 6 . however when the metabolic effects of smoking especially chronic smoking were studied in persons without diabetes the findings were controversial . smoking was reported to acutely impair insulin action and led to ir in normal subjects . even opposite effects on cell function were reported in current and former smokers when compared with nonsmokers . but few studies applying homa method are currently available for assessing the associations of chronic smoking in asians who exhibit lower levels of the homa of insulin resistance homa ir than western populations 1719 . moreover a dynamic evaluation of cell function such as oral glucose tolerance test ogtt according to smoking status was rare . this population based study aims to elucidate the effects of chronic smoking on ir and cell function in a large sample of chinese men without diabetes using both homa analysis and ogtt . the 1568 chinese men without diabetes in this study included 598 never smokers 120 former smokers and 850 current smokers table 1 . compared to never smokers current smokers had significantly decreased fasting insulin after adjustment for covariates p 0.0335 . the strength of association with cell deficiency was further analyzed after categorizing current smokers according to their pack year of smoking and using never smokers as references . the cell function gradually decreased with increasing smoking intensity ptrend 0.0001 and 0.0026 after adjustment for covariates and the differences were statistically significant when the pack year of smoking was 20 or above figure 1 . in addition fasting glucose increased with cumulative intensity of smoking the adjusted means 95 ci were 5.65 5.565.74 5.58 5.445.73 p 0.3857 5.55 5.425.69 p 0.1806 5.72 5.595.86 p 0.3271 and 5.78 5.665.91 p 0.0384 respectively for never smokers and current smokers with the pack year of smoking 10 10 20 and 30 ptrend 0.2177 . in this population based study we evaluated the associations between chronic smoking and ir and cell function in chinese men without diabetes . our results showed that current smoking was associated with decreased cell function in a dose dependent manner and the levels of 2 h glucose were significantly higher in current smokers than in never smokers . the metabolic effects of smoking have generally been studied in persons without diabetes in order to avoid the impacts from the medications or changed behaviors in patients with diabetes . however in the insulin resistance atherosclerosis study smoking was not associated with ir as assessed by a modified glucose tolerance test with minimal model analysis . but recent studies using the homa method reported inconsistent effects of smoking in caucasians such as high cell values and ir in normoglycaemic persons lower cell function in men without hypertension and diabetes or no association in men without diabetes . in chinese men without diabetes showed that no statistical difference in homa ir or homa was observed among current former and never smokers . our study including 1568 men without diabetes found impaired cell secretion in current smokers which was signified by both low values of homa and fasting insulin . reported that smoking cessation was associated with metabolic changes including increased cell secretion in response to glucose . all these findings provided consistent evidence and biological plausibility for the decreased insulin secretion in smokers especially heavy smokers in our study . in the dynamic evaluation of cell function using ogtt test we also found higher levels of 2 h glucose in current smokers which may be attributed to long term effects of nicotine exposure or may be from acute stress due to nicotine withdrawal . in our study increased 2 h plasma glucose during ogtt test indicated probably insulin resistance in current smokers . in conclusion our study suggested that chronic smoking impaired insulin secretion and probably brought about insulin resistance in chinese men without diabetes .", " strain sit12 was isolated in may 2015 by cultivation on marine medium in

presence of persistent vitreomacular adhesions exerting tractional forces vitreomacular traction vmt may be associated with the development of macular hole mh 2 3 . the normal process of pvd due to vitreous aging may be complicated by the presence of vitreomacular adhesions between the cortex and the macular area resulting from vitreous syneresis . on the other hand continuous anteroposterior traction by vitreous contraction may cause alterations such as cystoid macular edema . this anteroposterior vmt may cause intraretinal cavitation with progression to dehiscence of the outer retinal layers and complete detachment of the cyst roof giving rise to a full thickness defect . a few studies have been specifically addressed to the epidemiology of idiopathic vmt due to the overlapping of this condition with other ophthalmological diseases . in subjects with myopia now nearly two decades since the introduction of oct it is possible to assess and define the pathologic progression of disorders affecting vitreoretinal interface with a high level of accuracy and reproducibility . with this purpose a group of experts in diseases of the vitreoretinal interface international vitreomacular traction study group ivts have proposed a classification system for diseases of the vitreomacular interface . vma represents a specific stage of partial vitreous detachment in the perifoveal area without retinal abnormalities . the cutoff of 1500 m corresponds to the area of increased vitreous adhesion to the fovea . the following anatomic criteria should be present at least in one oct image to classify an eye as having vmt a evidence of perifoveal vitreous cortex detachment from the retinal surface b attachment of the vitreous cortex to the macula within a 3 mm radius of the fovea and c association of this attachment with distortion of the foveal surface intraretinal structural changes foveal detachment from the retinal pigment epithelium rpe or a combination of these findings without full thickness interruption of all retinal layers . in symptomatic patients enzymatic vitreolysis or vitrectomy may be indicated . primary mh results from vitreous traction on the fovea from anomalous pvd incomplete or inadequate separation of the vitreoretinal interface whereas secondary mhs are caused by other pathologic conditions and do not have preexisting or concurrent vmt . the availability of oct particularly spectral domain oct sd oct has allowed a more accurate diagnosis and precise assessment of adhesion of the vitreous to the macula differentiating vma from vmt . studies using sd oct have shown that incomplete vitreous detachment with persistent vitreoretinal adhesions is more frequently observed than by clinical diagnosis . during the physiological process of pvd the vitreous remains attached to the foveal region in the last stages figure 1 so that vma can be considered a normal stage in the natural history of pvd associated with vitreous aging 13 26 . investigated the spontaneous clinical course in 106 eyes of 81 patients identified as having vma by sd oct and classified into three grades with a mean follow up of 18 months range 1 to 91 . the authors defined three grades to classify adherence grade 1 41 was incomplete cortical vitreous separation with attachment at the fovea grade 2 52 was the grade 1 findings and any intraretinal cysts and grade 3 7 was the grade 2 findings and the presence of subretinal fluid . studying the retinal surface with sd oct it has been observed that pvd appears to begin in the perifoveal region with a slow clinical course taking even years until complete separation of the vitreous from the papilla figure 2 . in most patients this process is asymptomatic but in some cases pvd may be complicated by macular pathology . in a oct study of eyes with macular edema secondary to vmt published in 2012 complete and spontaneous resolution of traction the clinical course of vma particularly in asymptomatic patients remains to be fully elucidated . eligible patients had symptomatic focal vma as seen on oct and a best corrected visual acuity of 2025 or less . exclusion criteria were high myopia more than 8 diopters or axial length 26 mm prior vitrectomy or prior laser photocoagulation of the macula and other eye diseases that may affect visual acuity . at day 28 vma resolved in 26.5 of ocriplasmin injected eyes and in 10.1 of placebo injected eyes p 0.001 . according to the investigator s criteria all patients could be treated with vitrectomy in the framework of the study if macular disease did not resolve . at 6 months vitrectomy was performed in 17.7 of patients in the ocriplasmin group and in 26.6 of those in the placebo group p 0.02 . the favourable results obtained in both clinical trials allowed approval of the use of intravitreal injection of ocriplasmin for the treatment of symptomatic vmt and mh by the food and drug administration fda in the united states in november 2012 and by the european medicines agency ema in may 2013 . in a retrospective study 17 patients with symptomatic vmt were treated with a single intravitreal injection of ocriplasmin 0.125 mg . in another study of 19 patients with symptomatic vma treated with intravitreal ocriplasmin resolution of vma results were significantly affected by lens status with adhesion release in 53 of phakic patients whereas no case of resolution of adhesions was observed in pseudophakic patients . only one patient showed an important loss of visual acuity from 2070 to 20200 due to progression of vmt to a full thickness mh . there were no differences between the groups in terms of severe ocular adverse events including development of mh 5.2 versus 8.6 retinal detachment 0 versus 1.6 and reduced visual acuity 0.6 versus 0.5 . these patients also had transient reduction of visual acuity and demonstrated subretinal fluid during the release process with almost the exact time course as the loss of the os ellipsoid zone . however in a retrospective review of 62 eyes with symptomatic vma treated with ocriplasmin subretinal fluid appeared in 37 of cases with persistence of fluid in 30 of cases after 5 months of follow up . for refractory mh to the standard technique or for secondary mh after vitrectomy when peeling of the ilm has been already performed an autologous transplantation of the ilm remnants introduced into the hole with subsequent gas tamponade contributes to the improvement of anatomic and visual outcomes . combined phacovitrectomy or sequential vitrectomy and phacoemulsification are safe and effective for the treatment of mh with equivalent anatomic and functional results . moreover cataract develops in 75 to 95 of patients undergoing vitrectomy for mh within 3 years after surgery . in the study of the moorfields macular hole mmhs group an overall closure rate of 81 at 2 years was achieved in mhs stages 2 3 and 4 as well as an improvement in visual acuity of 636 to 618 which was clearly superior to results obtained in the observation group . in the vitrectomy for treatment of macular hole study vmhs the rate of anatomic closure was 69 and the final visual acuity was higher in the operated than in nonoperated eyes 20115 versus 20166 . although anatomic closure in mh surgery is achieved in more than 90 of cases sometimes it does not correlate well with improvement in visual acuity . multiple studies using oct have assessed hole configuration in an attempt to establish a correlation with postoperative visual acuity 8491 emphasizing the importance of changes in the outer retina . have analyzed 164 eyes with mh treated by vitrectomy and ilm peeling showing that restoration of the ellipsoid portion of the photoreceptor inner segment is an important prognostic factor for visual rehabilitation after mh surgery . reopening of the hole figure 4 is one of the best known complications after initially successful mh treatment with vitreous surgery 67 91101 . peeling of the ilm during primary mh surgery is one of the factors that has been mostly related to the incidence of reopening varying between 0 and 8 in eyes with ilm peeling 67 9597 and between 2 and 16 in eyes with no peeling 67 9395 97 . the incidence of recurrence was 0.39 in eyes with peeling of the ilm increasing to 7.2 with no peeling . retinal tears treated with laser may be one of the factors that increase the development of erm with subsequent tangential traction and reopening of the mh . with regard to treatment of persisting mh ilm peeling and erm removal should be performed in those cases in which these procedures were not performed at the initial macular surgery together with long acting gas tamponade c3f8 and strict face down positioning during the first postoperative days . in the presence of 1500 m traction or erm surgical treatment with vitrectomy 400 m in size with mvt and in the absence of erm enzymatic vitreolysis with ocriplasmin is again the most recommendable option . in cases of holes 400 m or in the absence of evident vmt or in the presence of erm vitrectomy is the first option . if resolution of vmt andor hole closure had not occurred after a month of treatment the likelihood of success is highly improbable and vitrectomy can be performed . in cases of vmt associated with other retinal diseases such as age related macular degeneration diabetic macular edema or vitreomacular interface pathology in the myope it is still too early to make a recommendation on the impact of enzymatic vitreolysis with ocriplasmin in the treatment of these conditions and we should await for results of ongoing clinical trials on this topic . finally in all cases the final decision regarding treatment with enzymatic vitreolysis with ocriplasmin or vitrectomy should be consensuated with the patient . enzymatic vitreolysis based on the intravitreal injection of ocriplasmin is a treatment option with proven efficacy and adequate safety profile in selected patients with vmt and mh . in cases of vmt treatment with ocriplasmin is indicated when traction is 1500 m and in the absence of concurrent macular diseases erm .", " the physiopathology of hydrocephalus lies in the dynamics of circulation of cerebrospinal fluid csf . the consequent csf stasis in hydrocephalus interferes with cerebral and ventricular system development penn and linninger 2009 . contrary to the previously held belief that gliosis in the hydrocephalic brain is restricted only to the periventricular white matter gliosis extends through all of the cortex and the peri aqueductal area penn and linninger 2009 . chronic hydrocephalus on other hand produces skull enlargement spasticity progressive neurological deficits in children and dementia urinary incontinence and gait changes in elderly bergsneider et al . in chronic cases it controls symptoms of intracranial pressure and interfere in cognitive and motor functions ishikawa et al . in this context we will try to settle a link between the notable modifications to neurophysiology secondary to hydrocephalus and the ability of neuronal tissue to reassume and reorganize its functions toward adaptation . 2003 hydrocephalus congenital or acquired represents a model of brain resilience too once transient or permanent perfusional deficits generate structural andor functional injuries being partially or completely compensated by remaining cortical areas ewing cobbs et al . later in the same year additionally norman geschwind 19261984 an american neurologist at boston s beth israel hospital known for his works with behavioral neurology also stated a certainty of capacity for reassigning functions following trauma and injuries in the brain what should represent a high level of organization of cerebral tissue in order to promote adaptation berker et al . other reports even generate a scientifical query in the past where the main question was the seemingly normal brain function with remarkable images of hydrocephalus and congenital malformations lewin 1980 . we try to illustrate this scene by presenting the brain parenchyma of a normal subject followed by the brain of a normal subject with impressive hydrocephalus oliveira et al . unpublished data and then an equally impressive hydrocephalus of a patient with profound symptoms oliveira et al . the contrast among a normal brain in a normal adult left the brain of a normal man with impressive hydrocephalus oliveira et al . unpublished data middle and an equally impressive hydrocephalus in a 54year old man with deep cognitive and motor impairment since childhood right oliveira et al . some important discussions about symptoms in hydrocephalic and non hydrocephalic patients were already reported . in adult hydrocephalus especially idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus inph it is observed recover after shunting procedures which represents proof of brain resilience bergsneider et al . rat models of chronic hydrocephalus suggested that disturbance in the postsynaptic integration processes rather than axonal conduction or synaptic transmission are more important for the production of the neurological deficits seen in chronic hydrocephalus kaye et al . therefore several examples can be elicited to assign neural plasticity and resilience applied to hydrocephalic models reassuming concepts of basic neurophysiology and discussing neural networks and integration regeneration of neuronal tissue and resilience to injuries . we should not forget that as long as there are large hydrocephalic tumoral traumatic and ischemic samples of brain resilience and recovery there are also cases of specific and punctiform lesions sometimes only seem in high definition image studies causing aggressive impairment of neurological function even compatible with death . clinical experience and experimental models have already shown the resistance of the brain tissue to injuries acute or chronic .", " oct is an emerging medical imaging technology which enables cross sectional imaging of tissue microstructure in situ and in real time . oct can achieve 110 m resolutions and 12 mm penetration depths approaching those of standard excisional biopsy and histopathology but without the need to remove and process tissue specimens . oct is analogous to ultrasound imaging except that imaging is performed by measuring the echo time delay and intensity of backscattered light rather than sound . oct imaging can be performed fiber optically using delivery devices such as hand held probes endoscopes catheters laparoscopes and needles which enable non invasive or minimally invasive internal body imaging . e a clinical vascular oct system and the fiber optic probe from lightlab imaging now st . up to date many clinical applications using oct have demonstrated in a diverse set of medical and surgical specialties . development of such devices facilitates the translation of oct to clinical applications and allows clinicians to use the enhanced imaging capabilities of this technique to benefit the patients . since its invention in 1991 oct has rapidly developed as a non invasive biomedical imaging modality that enables cross sectional visualization of tissue microstructures in vivo . the resolution of oct is one to two orders of magnitude higher than conventional ultrasound approaching that of histopathology thereby allowing architectural morphology to be visualized in situ and in real time . oct enables imaging of structures in which biopsy would be hazardous or impossible and promise to reduce the sampling errors associated with excisional biopsy . the most developed clinical oct applications are those focusing on ophthalmic cardiovascular and oncologic imaging . the resolution and imaging field of view of oct is approaching those of standard biopsy and histopathology therefore oct represents a potential method for optical biopsy of the tissue in situ which can guide the excision biopsy to improve the sampling accuracy . oct has shown promises in detecting structural alterations associated with malignancies including those arising in the breast bladder brain gastrointestinal respiratory and reproductive tracts skin larynx and oral cavity . in this review we focus on clinical oct applications in urology particularly in bladder ureter and kidney . oct and several other optical imaging techniques such as fluorescence imaging have been developed to better identify and characterize bladder lesions beyond what is possible with standard wlc . over the last decade both ex vivo and in vivo studies have been conducted on the ability of oct to detect bladder cancer by resolving the changes of bladder wall layers in urothelium lamina propria and muscularis propria andor the corresponding backscattering . a 32 patient study showed that oct has high detection accuracy for real time imaging and staging of bladder cancer adjunct to wlc 90 sensitivity and 89 specificity for tumor confined to the mucosa and 100 sensitivity and 90 specificity for muscle invasive tumors . furthermore the same work also demonstrated better tumor margin detection using oct to guide transurethral resection tur which is commonly used for non muscle invasive bladder cancer such as tcc that attributes to approximately 75 of all bladder cancer and to enhance re tur cases where the scar or necrosis induced by previous tur may make it difficult to identify residual or recurrent tumors by wlc . its oct image showed characteristics including no obvious urothelial thickening slightly decreased backscattering in urothelium and drastically diminished backscattering in lamina propria layer fig . higher oct axial resolution demonstrated the ability to differentiate healthy urothelial tissue cis and tcc from 142 fresh human bladder tissue samples . recently real time 3d oct imaging was demonstrated in 3 clinical cases with bladder ureter carcinoma to show the contrast of muscle invasive carcinoma area the scar tissue area from normal bladder wall and ureter with three distinguishable layers including the urothelium lamina propria and muscularis layer . results showed that oct could differentiate inflammatory lesions and tcc based on characterization of urothelial thickening and enhanced backscattering or heterogeneity which hfus failed due to insufficient image resolution and contrast . reported the intraluminal oct identification of anatomical layers of the healthy human ureter in vivo and the results for grading and staging upper urinary track uut urothelial carcinoma using oct . their study demonstrated that oct can 1 distinguish healthy tissues from tumors 2 differentiate invasive and non invasive tumors 3 differentiate grade 2 and 3 lesions by quantifying oct backscattering attenuation and thus has the potential to provide intraoperative real time histological information on stage and grade during minimally invasive procedures . figure 6 shows representative oct images of invasive tumor namely stage t3g3 urothelial carcinoma where distinction among anatomical layers was not possible . they demonstrated the capability of oct to distinguish normal renal parenchyma from malignant renal tumors based on the backscattering properties . however higher resolution oct is necessary to distinguish clear cell tumors and other renal carcinoma subtypes from normal parenchyma and between carcinoma subtype themselves which had a heterogeneous appearance on oct . both ex vivo and in vivo studies demonstrated the capability of oct to visualize kidney parenchyma morphology and function i.e. oct is a powerful medical imaging technology that can reveal microstructure and blood flow in biological tissues in a non invasive fashion and in real time .", " a total of 274 ars and dha postdose samples randomly distributed over the first 12 h of the study were included in the model . ars and dha exposures after the standard 2.4 mg kg dose were simulated at each body weight level 1000 simulations each at 1kg intervals from 6 to 25 kg using a uniform distribution of hemoglobin concentrations within the observed range 2.7213.6 g dl to account for the observed covariate relationship figure 3a b . children with body weights between 6 and 10 kg showed a mean reduction of 20.4 p 0.0001 in dha exposure as compared with children with body weights between 21 and 25 kg median 25th to 75th percentile exposure 3380 21305470 ng h ml in the 610 kg patients 3780 24306060 ng h ml in the 1115 kg patients 4100 25706590 ng h ml in the 1620 kg patients and 4240 27006840 ng h ml in the 2125 kg patients . this suggests that smaller children need higher doses of ars to attain ars exposures similar to those in children with higher body weights . there was no statistical difference between survivors and nonsurvivors with respect to total exposure ars p 0.8060 dha p 0.4828 or maximum concentration ars p 0.7655 dha p 0.6865 after the first dose . a total of 274 ars and dha postdose samples randomly distributed over the first 12 h of the study were included in the model . ars and dha exposures after the standard 2.4 mg kg dose were simulated at each body weight level 1000 simulations each at 1kg intervals from 6 to 25 kg using a uniform distribution of hemoglobin concentrations within the

25706590 ng h ml in the 1620 kg patients and 4240 27006840 ng h ml in the 2125 kg patients . this suggests that smaller children need higher doses of ars to attain ars exposures similar to those in children with higher body weights . there was no statistical difference between survivors and nonsurvivors with respect to total exposure ars p 0.8060 dha p 0.4828 or maximum concentration ars p 0.7655 dha p 0.6865 after the first dose . only limited data are available on the pharmacokinetics of parenteral rectal and oral ars in children . ars was converted rapidly into dha the ars elimination half life being 26 min . this is in agreement with ars half life values reported in other pharmacokinetic studies of i.m . the volume of distribution values maximum concentration values and area under the concentration time curves of ars and dha are also comparable with the findings from a previous small and densely sampled pharmacokinetic study of i.m . administration this is still far greater than the in vitro defined dha concentration value of 2.28 ng ml that is required for 99 inhibition ic . injection 90 fast absorption and comparable estimates for ars and dha exposure support the use of i.m . this has also been reported in other population pharmacokinetic studies of oral and rectal ars in pediatric and mixed adult pediatric populations . dosing simulations using an exact dose of 2.4 mg kg resulted in lower ars and dha exposures in small children as compared with those with body weights of 25 kg suggesting the need for higher dosing in small children . hemoglobin concentration was found to be associated with reduced exposure levels of ars and dha independent of body weight . because oral ars has a bioavailability of 80 this corresponds to a total parenteral dose of 33.6 mg kg which would be reached only if parenteral treatment were continued for 14 doses . because the weight bands are smaller for children with body weights 14 kg we propose an incremental ars dose increase of 5 instead of 10 mg and a dilution of 10 mg ml for i.m . administration in this group similar to the dosage regimen in the current study . no children with body weight 6.5 kg were included therefore more studies of ars population pharmacokinetics are needed to evaluate dosing in these very small children and to support the current dosing recommendations . in conclusion ars and dha exposures were lower in small children after i.m . administration of ars in severe malaria warranting dose adaptation in this group . this pharmacokinetic assessment of ars was part of the aquamat trial registration number isrctn 50258054 a large multinational trial for which the results have been published elsewhere . the contents of each 60 mg vial of ars were dissolved in 1 ml 5 sodium bicarbonate provided with the drug and further diluted with 5 ml 5 dextrose final concentration of 10 mg ml before administration as a deep i.m . blood samples 1.5 ml were drawn from an indwelling catheter into prechilled fluoride oxalate tubes for ars and dha quantification before the first dose at baseline . ars drug content and quality were checked in vials taken randomly from the purchase lots see supplementary data online . no drug exposure target is defined for parenteral ars therefore for the purpose of arriving at a practical parenteral dosing regimen different body weight bins were evaluated to ensure similar target exposures in all weight bands in agreement with the exposure in children of body weight 25 kg . the effects of ars and dha exposures on outcomes were investigated using a time to event analysis in nonmem with predicted drug concentrations being used to modulate the hazard function in a traditional maximum effect emax relationship .", " laparoscopic

of complex reactions to different training loads234 . our hypothesis states that the training gain achieved by training with the circulatory restriction applied during low intensity exercising lies within the physiological limits of the cardiovascular system . the aim of this study was to the effect of a single occlusion training session on the cardiovascular response to bouts of exercise . the subjects in the study were amateur athletes in track and field with 46 years of training experience and they participated in two groups a control group without blood flow restriction and experimental group with blood flow restriction n24 mean age 22.5 1.5 years body mass index 24.7 0.5 kg m . during recovery from the first set hr was 84.8 5.4 beats min in the subjects with the circulatory restriction while the value for the other group was 82.0 3.1 beats min . changes in heart rate during exercise and at rest before the study there was no significant statistical difference between the groups when comparing both systolic and diastolic abp p0.05 . in addition we did not find any difference between groups in terms of changes in diastolic abp during exercise and we observed a low tendency for systolic abp to increase in response to repeated sets of exercise table 1table 1.average increase in systolic and diastolic abp during exercise setssystolic mmhgdiastolic mmhgset 1set

first set of exercises were not significantly different however a tendency for a lower increase in jt rr during the repeated exercise sets performed with partial circulatory restriction was observed fig . results obtained during this study revealed that the increase in hr during the exercise was more notable in the control group compared with the experimental group . in assessing these findings as it was shown by other authors17 the jt rr ratio allows depiction of the mobilization of the cardiovascular system during exercising . the data from this study indicate that cardiac muscle strain was slightly lower when the low intensity exercise was carried out with a partial circulatory restriction . the heart reserve possibility of largely depends on whether the demand for oxygen is satisfied and on as how quickly and sufficiently oxygen is delivered to the heart during the exercise . thus assessment of the degree of ischemic episodes during exercise is also essential and indicates the functional state of the heart . partial blood flow restriction had an ambiguous effect on blood pressure changes during the exercise . systolic abp values continued to be higher during the exercise while changes in diastolic abp were not registered . we concluded that when a partial blood flow restriction was applied during repeated exercise the heart mobilization and recovery features were better reflected in the jt rr ratio than in hr . in assessment of manifestations of hr fluctuations it was found that the amplitude of hr change in response to exercise repetitions remained the same while the increase in mechanical work duration of the myocardium as indicated by the jt rr ratio was lower which can be interpreted as indicating that the heart could perform its pumping function with more ease . in summary we conclude that applying partial blood flow restriction with occlusion training in the groin area resulted in a lower degree of hr increase in response to repeated exercise compared with training without occlusion . meanwhile the cardiovascular system during exercise does not experience higher overload which could be a risk factor for cardiac patients and physically inactive persons .", " females without and with asperger syndrome are better at recognizing emotions from dynamic faces than males golan et al . moreover females tend to better recognize emotions from faces than from voices whereas males exhibit the opposite tendency . the present work intends to make an initial step in filling the gap and to clarify whether and if so how perceiver s gender affects recognition of emotional expressions conveyed by actions of others . more specifically we ask i whether gender affects recognition of emotions represented by body motion or in other words whether females excel in recognition of emotional actions and ii whether gender effects depend on emotional content of actions . to this end healthy young females and males were presented with point light displays portraying knocking at a door with different emotional expressions happy neutral and angry . point light displays were recorded during performance of knocking with different emotional content happy neutral and angry . on each trial participants indicated by pressing with their dominant hand one of three respective keys on a computer keyboard whether a display portrayed happy neutral or angry knocking . percentage correct in recognition of emotions conveyed by knocking is represented in figure 2a . in both females and males recognition of all emotional expressions was above chance level p 0.001 . a percentage correct males outperformed in recognition of happy knocking p 0.015 whereas females excelled in recognition of neutral knocking p 0.016 and tended to over perform in recognition of angry knocking p 0.07 . significant differences are indicated by an asterisk b error rate the lack of gender differences in error rate demonstrates that gender differences in recognition accuracy of emotional content of knocking were not caused by gender related bias for mistaking one emotion for another . individual number of correct responses was submitted to a 2 3 repeated measures anova as assessed by the shapiro wilk test the data were normally distributed with factors gender female male and emotional expression of knocking happy neutral angry . planned pair wise comparisons indicated that males outperformed in recognition of happy knocking t32 2.58 p 0.015 one tailed here and below bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons d 0.84 whereas females tended to over perform in recognition of angry knocking t32 1.87 p 0.07 one tailed and excelled in recognition of neutral knocking t32 2.54 p 0.016 one tailed d 0.88 . instead the findings indicate that sex effects in recognition accuracy are modulated by emotional contents of actions . error analysis figure 2b indicated that by both females and males happy knocking was mistaken for neutral knocking in more than 80 of wrong responses error rate 0.84 and 0.86 for females and males respectively gender difference t32 0.42 p 0.68 two tailed ns . in turn with a lack of gender differences neutral knocking was misperceived as happy actions in about 70 of error responses error rate 0.68 and 0.67 for females and males respectively gender differences t32 0.02 p 0.99 two tailed ns . in about 80 of error trials in response to angry knocking both females and males mistook angry knocking for neutral knocking error rate 0.79 and 0.8 for females and males respectively gender difference t32 0.14 p 0.88 two tailed ns . the lack of gender differences in error rate suggests that gender effects in recognition accuracy of emotional content of knocking observed in the present study are not caused by gender related bias for mistaking one emotion for another . however a main effect of emotional expression was significant f232 35.16 p 0.0001 with the fastest response to angry knocking and the slowest response to neutral knocking figure 2b . post hoc pair wise comparisons showed no gender difference in response time to happy t32 0.09 p 0.93 two tailed ns average 2.00 0.39 and 1.99 0.28 s from the stimulus onset for females and males respectively neutral t32 1.21 p 0.24 two tailed ns average 2.15 0.33 and 2.28 0.3 s for females and males respectively and angry knocking t32 0.14 p 0.89 two tailed ns average 1.84 0.32 and 1.85 0.28 for females and males respectively . the outcome of the study indicates that gender affects accuracy rather than speed of body language reading . to the best of our knowledge the gender effect however is modulated by the emotional content of actions . females tend to excel in recognition accuracy of angry knocking whereas males over perform in recognition of happy actions . social cognition in men is presumably connected with active interactions and immediate reactions and therefore emotion perception is likely associated with motor programs . moreover males are equally responsive to happiness conveyed through static and dynamic happy faces males rate the intensity of dynamic and static expressions of happiness equally high whereas females are less responsive to happiness in static faces biele and grabowska 2006 . this suggests that women are better tuned to the lack of emotional content in body actions . future research should clarify whether gender effects in body language reading occur with other repertoires of actions and with other arrays of emotions . studies of sex effects on the social brain have been limited to investigation of face expressions or body actions represented in still photographs . brain activation in females is reported to be more bilaterally distributed presumably providing greater contribution of both hemispheres to identification of facial affect bourne 2005 proverbio et al . in accordance with widespread belief it is reported that the female brain is more responsive to social stimuli represented in still images proverbio et al . gender effects at behavioral level do not necessarily imply that there is sex related difference in brain activation subserving body language reading . several types of interrelations between behavioral measures and brain mechanisms engaged in social perception should be taken into account i sex differences both in behavioral and brain responses ii sex differences detectable either at behavioral level or only in brain activation and iii absence of sex differences both at behavioral and brain levels pavlova 2009 . future research should be directed at uncovering sex differences in brain activity during body language reading .", " overall incidence of acute dystonic reactions with antipsychotic medications is 2.55 majority of which are due to typical and high potency antipsychotics . the following case report is of aripiprazole induced oculogyric crisis acute dystonia . within 3 days of admission she was put on aripiprazole 10 mg orally in two divided dosages for her psychotic symptoms while continuing eszopiclone with promethazine 25 mg nocte . various case reports of aripiprazole induced acute dystonia report symptoms of neck extension torticollis rigidity and tongue movements.810 in addition various studies describe medications causing acute dystonic reactions and their management which are described in the table 1 . this case a female patient on third generation antipsychotic medicine aripiprazole has least propensity for dystonia.13 the risk factor for developing acute dystonia in this case is history of acute dystonia . acute dystonia occurred after 5 days on increasing aripiprazole from 10 mg to 20 mg per day orally in two divided dosage . since aripiprazole lacks protective anticholinergic action it can have a potential to precipitate dystonia . this was supported by the fact that in this case dystonia resolved with promethazine an antihistaminic with anticholinergic property . this case outlines a significant side effect of aripiprazole which a practitioner should be vigilant about before initiating the medication .", " afterwards she experienced dyspnea in the second week after the operation and was performed the transthoracic echocardiography tte which showed right atrial thrombi and was treated with the low molecular weight heparin lmwh . her chest ct showed that pulmonary thromboembolism was found in both main pulmonary arteries while dvt was observed in left femoral vein fig . particularly it was reported that the patients with pfo even might develop arterial thromboembolism with cryptogenic stroke.36 in the present case the authors suspected that cryptogenic stroke 3 days after the operation might possibly have been caused by the vte changed into arterial thromboembolism through pfo . nonetheless it can affect as the risk factor for several conditions including ischemic stroke platypnea orthodeoxia syndrome and decompression sickness.7 pfo as the cause of cryptogenic stroke is not uncommon hence the occurrence of ischemic stroke with either pe or dvt can be considered as the possible example of paradoxical embolism through right to left shunt.8 among the treatments on the prevention of frequent strokes within a patient who has pfo there are medical options and invasive methods.9 the medical options include the use of antiplatelet agents as well as the prescription of warfarin in the patients with hypercoagulable state or venous thrombosis . in terms of invasive methods it was used to have an operation in the past while the application of device closure is being used recently.10 in this case cryptogenic stroke took place within 3 days after tka while right atrial thrombus dvt and pe were present in a way that the passage through right to left shunt was speculated and the result of subsequent echocardiography led to the diagnosis of a positive reaction from the agitated saline test for pfo . in conclusion the occurrence of pulmonary thromboembolism or dvt in a patient with pfo can trigger the development of cryptogenic stroke through right to left shunt .", " as a lipid metabolism disorder

. lyplal1 rs12137855 as the susceptibility gene of nafld was widely studied but the results were inconsistent . no research has been performed on the association between polymorphism of lyplal1 and nafld in chinese han population . the aim of our study was to investigate the association between nafld and lyplal1 in chinese han population and assess the effect of this gene on serum lipid profiles . genotype and alleles were estimated by chi square test and dna distributions between nafld patients and controls were analyzed by pearson s test or fisher s exact test where appropriate . the

literature for over 300 years . hyperostosis frontalis interna has not been reported in an asymptomatic patient younger than 10 years of age hence the present patient is the first case in the medline database . with the existing findings it is difficult to address whether the trauma was related to hyperostosis frontalis interna . to the best of our knowledge there have been no previous reports in the literature associating hyperostosis frontalis interna with brain trauma . in some severe cases hyperostosis frontalis interna leads to compression of soft tissue dural irritation and brain atrophy because of the thickening of the skull and decrease in the intracranial volume . hyperostosis frontalis interna is commonly an incidental finding in x ray ct and mri studies . histologically the process of hyperostosis frontalis interna is thought to be a deposition of new bone primarily on the inner table and a progressive development of diploe . hyperostosis frontalis interna is characterized by remodeling of the inner table of the frontal bone into a cancellous phenotype . hyperostosis frontalis interna is a benign process and the majority of patients appear to be asymptomatic thus conservative observation can be used in these cases . if hyperostosis frontalis interna leads to headaches neurologic symptoms psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment the surgical excision of the thickened portion of the bone is the only method of treatment to relieve the symptoms . the etiology however remains unclear and it is difficult to prove the correlation between hyperostosis frontalis interna and brain injury .", " in the new england journal of medicine in 1998 whether or not and in what ways the different strategies of mechanical ventilation affect the clinical outcome of ards patients remains a controversial topic among physicians and researchers . lung protective strategy for ards patients that includes the following 7 recommendations tidal volume should be targeted to 6 ml kg of predicted body weight pbw plateau pressures in a passively inflated lung should be limited to 30 cm h2o . higher levels of peep should be strategically used for patients with moderate or severe sepsis induced ards even though it is difficult to specify the absolute values of higher levels of peep we think the ardsnet standard peep strategy is the reasonable choice for peep setting because the much higher peep strategy adopted in alveoli trial s higher peep group did not show significant improvement in survival they set peep as high as possible without increasing the maximum inspiratory plateau pressure 28 30 cmh2o by keeping tidal volume of 6 ml kg . reported in their systematic review that in mechanically ventilated patients who did not manifest ards at the time of endotracheal intubation the use of lower tidal volume ventilation reduced their progression to ards . second limiting the tidal volume to 6 ml kg pbw and the plateau pressure to 30 cmh2o may not be sufficient to minimize lung injury in certain severe ards patients . third as ards is a heterogeneous syndrome optimization of ventilator settings for each individual would be required when mechanically ventilating ards patients . for example among patients with recruitable lung increasing peep may help to avoid the cyclic opening and closing of alveoli without increasing over distention alveolar strain . however among patients with no or little recruitable lung increasing peep may not prevent such cyclic opening and closing but also cause over distention . compared with cv hfo was hypothesized to be a superior ventilatory strategy as it could avoid cyclic collapse and hyperinflation of the alveoli . demonstrated in a recent prospective study that using high mean airway pressure in subjects under hfo worsened right ventricular function compared with cv in ards patients . in addition to ct and eit pleural pressure and transpulmonary pressure must be taken into account when optimizing ventilator settings for individual ards patients as it is transpulmonary pressure stress but not airway pressure per se that determines alveolar size lung volume during ventilation . chiumello et al elucidated that the specific lung elastance was around 13.5 cmh2o in all the subgroups surgical patients medical patients ali patients and ards patients and was not affected by the peep and tidal volume . one study proposed that when optimizing ventilator settings for individual ards patients peep should be adjusted based on esophageal pressure measurements . one must be aware that the onset of spontaneous breathing during mechanical ventilation can be harmful to some ards patients . spontaneous breathing during lung protective mechanical ventilation in patients with ards could induce a large negative deflection in pleural pressure . demonstrated in their animal study that spontaneous breathing superimposed on cv could induce lung injury even when plateau pressure was kept below 30 cmh2o . in summary the authors believe that the protective ventilatory strategy recommended in the sscg 2012 report is sub optimal for some ards patients . for such patients individual optimizations of ventilator settings the authors would also propose to further reduce tidal volume use nmbas if necessary and if possible determine peep settings based on transpulmonary pressure for those ards patients who failed to improve using the sscg 2012recommended ventilatory protocol .", " compliance of elderly patients to intensive multimodality cancer therapy can be challenging due to significant treatment related toxicities the logistical demands involved in treatments and unplanned treatment gaps introduced between the treatments . the present study evaluated compliance of elderly hnscc to cancer directed therapy . to our knowledge this study is one of the first studies evaluating compliance and overall treatment time of elderly hnscc patients to cancer directed therapy from a developing nation . our study included a total of forty seven elderly hnscc patients age 65 years or older referred for radiotherapy from the various multi disciplinary clinics at our institute in one unit of department of radiotherapy from july 2010 to june 2011 . compliance was evaluated with regard to age stage general condition performance status presence of co morbidity and intention of treatment . further to study the pattern of non compliance patients were divided into early non compliance patients that were non compliant during the investigation and staging work up period mid course non compliance patients non compliant after complete diagnostic work up and treatment decision but before radiation delivery and late non compliance patients non compliant during radiation delivery . out of the 47 elderly patients analysis of compliance to treatment decision revealed that 62 2947 of the elderly hnscc patients were compliant to cancer directed therapy whereas 38 1847 of the patients were not able to complete the stipulated treatment . a further analysis on pattern of non compliance revealed that early non compliance to therapy was seen in 5 118 of the patients whereas majority 1418 of elderly patients showed mid course non compliance . the highlights of this study can be the pattern of elderly hnscc patient non compliance revealed that majority of the elderly patients 83 were non compliant to treatment before the initiation of radiation therapy . this was a bit surprising result as elderly patients were expected to be non compliant to treatment during the course of radiation therapy because of development of increased acute radiation morbidity worsening of performance status and poor tolerance.to our knowledge the present study is the first study to report early to mid course non compliance to cancer directed therapy in elderly hnscc patients . as per available records the reasons for this early to mid course non compliance finding the probable explanation could be a long median radiation waiting of two months at our cancer center during which some elderly patients may have preferred early cancer directed therapy at some other cancer centers . this aspect of early to mid course non compliance to cancer directed treatment that emerged as predominant factor in our study needs to be further evaluated especially in developing countries where there is much load on the available machines and where the cancer patient population has probably outnumbered the available resources . the pattern of elderly hnscc patient

neoplasms in sites of scars is an infrequent but well known phenomenon.5 although the coexistence of cutaneous leishmaniasis and bcc may have been coincidental some studies suggest that an association between these two entities does exist.6 leishmaniasis can directly or indirectly alter the diagnosis and course of different malignancies.7 there are reports of bcc in chronic leg ulcers.8 cases of bcc developing in a leishmania scar have also been documented9 but to our knowledge cases of both leishmaniasis and bcc in the same site and the same lesion are rare.10 however in this case solid organ transplantation and long term immuno suppressive therapy should be considered as risk factors for malignancy . advances in effective immuno suppression after organ transplantation have led to increased risk of malignancies particularly skin cancers11 including squamous cell carcinoma basal bcc and malignant melanoma.12 thus malignancies should be considered in the differential diagnosis of leishmaniasis lesions difficult to treat .", " intravitreal voriconazole 80 g0.1ml and ceftazidime 2 mg0.1ml were injected and topical voriconazole 1 was administered every 2 hours . because of a lack

voriconazole.8 voriconazole showed lower mics compared to other antifungal agents when tested against five corneal isolates of scedosporium apiospermum2 and it had the best in vitro susceptibility profile for 34 common fungal pathogens compared to other antifungal agents.9 gao et al.10 reported that direct intravitreal voriconazole injections of 25 g ml equivalent to 100 mg per injection in a human eye caused no electroretinographic or histopathologic abnormalities in rodent retinas . kramer et al.11 reported that intravitreal injection of voriconazole 100 g0.1ml with pars plana vitrectomy was an effective therapy for aspergillus endophthalmitis . in conclusion voriconazole is a new promising therapy for fungal keratitis refractory to standard antifungal agents .", " since pfe has some antioxidant property and may alleviate hepatotoxicity this study evaluated the possible preventive hepatoprotective effect of pfe on liver injury induced by apap in rat . to induce hepatotoxicity 1h after the last pretreatment by pfe 5 6 ml of blood was obtained by cardiac puncture 24 h after induction of hepatotoxicity and plasma samples were separated by the heparinized syringe and analyzed for various biochemical parameters . tables 1 and 2 reveal that plasma ast and alt levels were increased in rats administered with apap when compared with controls indicating reliable induction of hepatotoxicity by apap p 0.01 . as shown pretreatments with different doses of the extract attenuated the reduction in plasma levels of total protein and albumin to some extent . pretreatment with pfe especially at 75 mg kg provided marked protective effect and comparable improvement on these biochemical indices . effect of prosopis farcta on liver enzymes in rats effect of prosopis farcta on liver enzymes and total protein albumin and lipid profile in rats the present study for the first time brings about the potential hepatoprotective activity of pfe against apap induced hepatotoxcity . pretreatment with oral doses of p. farca extract attenuated the enzyme activities which are indications of the protective activities of the pfe against apap hepatotoxicities . it is possible that presence of polyphenols and flavonoids in pf might be responsible for its protective effect on apap induced liver damage in rats . pf with antioxidant property is capable of preventing ldl peroxidation and inhibiting elevation of ldl by apap . in this study the decreased total protein and albumin levels by apap were significantly improved in pfe treated groups indicating of its hepatoprotective effect . based on the results of the present study it can be concluded that the aqueous extracts of pf beans exhibit hepatoprotective activity against apap . further investigations on cellular and molecular mechanism of the plant may throw more light on the use of pf for hepatoprotective activity .", " the first analytical methods related to food were therefore developed to detect melamine migration from resins used in food contact materials 3 . the first cases of melamine adulteration were detected in fish meals from italy in the late 1970s 78 and methods to detect melamine in potato proteins were developed in switzerland in the 1980s 6 . nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy has been proposed as probably the best nontargeted technique for use in screening food extracts 21 . in this study on the basis of our experience with beer 23 and fruit juice screening 1924 we demonstrate for the first time that nmr is useful for nontargeted screening of baby food formula for health relevant compounds such as melamine and also for labeling controls e.g. additionally we provide information that the 400 mhz nmr spectra of liquid sample extracts can also be used for quantification of melamine . using 700 mhz high resolution magic angle spinning hrmas nmr we demonstrate that melamine can be quantitatively detected in complicated food matrices without any sample preparation . its intensity was derived by fitting a theoretical signal on the spectrum which minimized the sum of squares of the residues and therefore optimally explained the melamine influence on the nmr spectrum . the integral value of this fitted signal was linearly dependent on the melamine concentration and did not require a calibration for each sample when fixed acquisition and preparation parameters were used . comparison of melamine contaminated sanlu sample with the reference distribution of a collection of infant formulas measurement in dmso d6 at 400 mhz . since this procedure yields a robust description a few atypical samples in the reference group the melamine signal of the sanlu infant formula was easily detected manually and in automation since its intensity translates into a z score larger than 56 medianreference z stdreference a z score of about 3 would cover 99 of all samples under normal distribution assumption . then 600 l of homogenized solution was transferred to a standard 5 mm nmr tube for analysis . when it became evident that the melamine peak itself could not be measured in water the sample preparation was repeated in 99.8 dmso d6 deutero gmbh while 20 0.4 mg of infant powder was dissolved in 2 ml of dmso d6 . for calibration melamine standards in dmso d6 at a concentration range between 2 and 200 mg l were measured . for hrmas calibration a blank matrix nestl student sweetened milk powder nestl china absence of melamine was confirmed by reference analysis was filled in the rotor and 45 l of melamine standard solution in dmso d6 was added . at this point in time only one study in the literature has presented h nmr data on melamine in the context of a kinetic study 25 . the identification of the singlet peak of nh2 at 5.93 ppm in dmso d6 for melamine was confirmed using measurements of pure standards as well as standard addition to positive samples . in contrast to the previous belief that nmr is only suitable for structure verification elucidation and purity analysis 24 our results clearly demonstrate that nmr can be used for quantitative analysis of foods for health relevant compounds . measuring solution is the final sample extract filled into the nmr tubes or injected into the lc ms ms system . regarding the precision of the methods the 400 mhz method showed a coefficient of variation of 3.2 n 9 replicated measurement of authentic contaminated sanlu sample while the coefficient of variation of the hrmas 700 mhz method was 2.6 measurement of spiked infant formula n 11 . the precision of nmr was judged to be sufficient for the purposes of food analysis . regarding accuracy the nmr results were compared to the lc ms ms reference procedure . for the contaminated sanlu formula the 400 mhz nmr the 700 mhz nmr and the lc ms ms melamine results were 412 mg kg 460 mg kg and 470 mg kg respectively and for the contaminated candy the melamine results were 47 mg kg 74 mg kg and 68 mg kg respectively . nevertheless we also judge the 400 mhz procedure in the current form as suitable for food screening because any amount of melamine is of course not admissible so that even a qualitative result would be sufficient e.g. our study is the first to apply hrmas nmr to quantitatively determine melamine in authentic food matrices . lc ms ms with spe extraction is clearly the preferred method for melamine quantification in all kinds of foods 4043 . in our research to establish a quantitative method for nmr analysis of melamine it became quickly evident that even by a simple visual inspection of the nmr spectra the sanlu sample showed differences . upper panel comparison of melamine contaminated sanlu sample with the reference distribution of a collection of infant formulas measurement in water at 400 mhz . in this case this finding shows that the nmr method can also allow one to check recipes and labeling claims such as lactose free hypoallergenic etc . we therefore conclude that the routine application of nmr in the screening of baby food products would provide a considerable improvement in consumer protection . so far only nmr can be seen as a holistic approach for detecting adulteration in infant formula .", " some other researchers have focused on driver s physiological changes such as the measurement of eye activity heart rate skin electrical potential and specially eeg activity as a means to detect cognitive states 21 22 . monitoring physiological signals while driving can provide the possibility to detect and warn fatigue 32 . therefore eeg monitoring during driving may be a promising variable for using in fatigue countermeasure devices 24 . it has been suggested that during driving at night delta band varies significantly with the degree of fatigue 33 . some researchers have presented an eeg based cerebral workload index based on the increase of eeg power spectra in the theta band over prefrontal areas and the immediate decrease of eeg power spectra over parietal areas in alpha band during driving 34 . however research on the physiological links specially eeg frequency bands to driver fatigue is still exploratory and is an important area that needs further investigation . therefore this study attempted to detect the driver mental fatigue through changes in eeg alpha power activity . we compared the absolute and relative alpha power variations in the first and last 10 minutes of driving with the f vas scores . before resuming the experiments then eeg and eog signals were recorded from the subjects in relaxed sitting posture for 3 minutes with closed eyes imagining driving on a highway and 3 minutes with open eyes looking at a road picture on the screen as a baseline for alertness . at the same time a continuous eeg and eog records were taken during the driving on the car simulator . these videos were used to rate the fatigue level of drivers on a four point scale from 1alert to 4 very tired by two trained observers . moreover the self rating of fatigue was performed during the driving using fvas scored from 0 no fatigue or energetic to 10 worst possible fatigue in every 10 minute interval . we compared the absolute and relative alpha power variations in the first and last 10 minutes of driving with the f vas scores . before resuming the experiments the car driver s sleepiness propensity was measured by the epworth sleepiness scale . then eeg and eog signals were recorded from the subjects in relaxed sitting posture for 3 minutes with closed eyes imagining driving on a highway and 3 minutes with open eyes looking at a road picture on the screen as a baseline for alertness . at the same time a continuous eeg and eog records were taken during the driving on the car simulator . these videos were used to rate the fatigue level of drivers on a four point scale from 1alert to 4 very tired by two trained observers . moreover the self rating of fatigue was performed during the driving using fvas scored from 0 no fatigue or energetic to 10 worst possible fatigue in every 10 minute interval . compared with the initial section the f vas scores increase significantly p 0.001 during the final section of driving task which demonstrates that continuous monotonous driving may predispose the subjects to cognitive fatigue . different fatigue measures in i10d and f10d i10d the initial 10 min of driving f10d the final 10 min of driving furthermore table 2 presents the video scores rated by trained observers in the initial and final 10 minutes of driving . moreover our findings showed no differences in absolute alpha power in different areas of the scalp in the initial and final 10 minutes of driving except in the parietal area of the brain p0.005 . this study attempted to present a simple and reliable method for early detection of driver mental fatigue based on eeg alpha power in healthy sleep deprived drivers . in our experiment different fatigue outcome measures including subjective self report of fatigue f vas video ratings as well as eeg alpha powers were employed to evaluate the change in fatigue for drivers during the initial and final 10 minutes of driving . the experimental results suggested a significant increase in the subjective self report of fatigue fvas scores during the final 10 minutes of driving . the increase in alpha rhythm in the final 10 minutes of driving depicted the decrease in the level of alertness and attention and the commencement of fatigue and drowsiness . the present study specifically deals with eeg alpha power in the initial and final section of driving in partially sleep deprived drivers a very prominent aspect of driver fatigue analysis . this study suggests that alpha brain wave rhythm can be a good indicator for early prediction of driver fatigue .", " there are many published reports of malfunction of the inner tube of the bain co axial circuit with potentially lethal complications for the patient . the following case report describes a case where profound hypercapnia occurred consequent to avulsion of the inner tube of the co axial circuit at the machine end of the circuit which was neither apparent nor visible to the anaesthesiologist . close examination of the original circuit revealed that the inner tubing of the co axial tube had become disconnected from its seat at the machine end of the circuit figure 1 . this was a previously unused bain circuit and we had not checked the integrity of the inner tubing before inducing the patient . this test will not detect a system in which inner tube is omitted or does not extend to the patient port or one that has holes at the patient end of the inner tube.3foex crampton smith manoeuvre this manoeuvre assesses the gas flow line from the flowmeters of the machine to the patient end of the circuit . in this regard the foex crampton smith manoeuvre with the ghani modification appears to be most satisfactory method of assessing the integrity of the gas line from the flowmeter up to the patient end of the bain circuit .", " we attempted to estimate the perceived degree of urgency of the visit and to identify reasons for seeking non urgent care in the ped by patients and parents . more than half of patients and parents presenting to the ped believed they had minor or somewhat urgent complaints .", " number of suicidal incidences is proportional to attempted suicide cases hence if attempt cases reduced number of suicidal death can also be decreased and for that purpose risk factors should be identified and reduced . there are number of risk factors for suicide which varies according to country culture religion gender age and social values . surrounding rural population including rural population of adjoining districts therefore it is important to properly understand the risk factors for attempted suicide cases of little studied lower socioeconomic class rural population so that suitable policies and programs can be initiated for prevention . this was a prospective study in which all the suicide attempt cases reported at bhaskar medical college and general hospital were included . these patients have undergone a detailed psychiatric interview including their demographic details and complete suicide risk assessment was done using beck s suicide intent scale . marital status and children majority of subjects attempted suicide 1 time although 10 female and 6.25 male attempted 2 time . prevalence of psychiatric disorders on the suicide assessment scale in isolation parameter score 2 was predominantly observed in females 70 while in males scores 2 and 3 was equal 43.8 each . scores on suicide assessment scale score 1 was mainly observed in final acts in anticipation of death female 95 male 93.8 active preparation for attempt female 90 male 56.3 and a suicide note 100 in both groups parameters although 31.3 males scored 2 on active preparation for attempt parameter . scores on suicide assessment scale on expectations of fatality parameter score 3 was more common in females 60 while in males score 2 was common 68.8 . this prospective study was conducted to explore the sociodemographic variables in individuals with suicidal attempt in which females n 20 have outnumbered males n 16 . have reported a higher incidence of suicide attempts in males when compared to females in indian population which is contrast to our finding in south india . people in 21 30 years age group had more suicidal rate than those belonging to other age groups . on incidence rates of suicide in west bengal which concluded that the vulnerable age group being those between the ages of 18 and 30 years . also found predominance of married individuals in their study of which was conducted to find out sociodemographic profile clinical factors and mode of attempt of suicide attempt . most of the individuals 62.5 had regular intake of alcohol and 31.25 of the study population attempted suicide under the influence of alcohol . in this study diverse precipitating factors for suicide attempt were observed . therefore this may not represent all the individuals who had attempted suicide as there is a chance of people not consulting psychiatry department . we conclude that in the studied population risk of suicide attempt is almost equal in terms of medium and high category of suicide assessment scale in both the genders . females in between the age group of 20 and 30 years uneducated married and daily laborers by occupation are involved more than males and thus such category of females have greater risk for suicide attempt .", " a complete mechanistic understanding of cellular machinery is the key to moving from principle to practice in lipid production . the purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the current knowledge of the different cellular and biochemical mechanisms involved in neutral and polymeric lipid accumulation within four main single cell microbial groups yeasts microalgae bacteria and archaea . special emphasis is given to the production of triacylglycerols tag and polyhydroxyalkanoates pha as the hallmark lipids accumulated in eukaryotes and prokaryotes respectively . fatty acyl chains allocation to intracellular lipid pools e.g. in microorganisms different types of neutral lipids are accumulated by different types of scm . for example in oleaginous yeast tag andor sterol esters se are the primary neutral lipids accumulated inside the cell whereas in specific types of bacteria and archaea polyhydroxyalkanoates pha and to a lesser extent tag and wax esters are preferentially stored . key membranes involved in the accumulation of lipids include the plasma membrane in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes and in the case of eukaryotes the endoplasmic reticulum er peroxisome mitochondrial plastidial and their variants such as apicoplastidial or even thylakoid membranes depending on the organism . key intermediates such as acetyl coenzyme a ac coa malonyl coenzyme a mal coa acyl coenzyme a acyl coa and glycerol3phosphate g3p are also pooled in strategic cellular locations such as the cytosol plastidial stroma and mitochondrial intermembrane space . the distribution of the different biosynthetic enzymes plays a key role in achieving the correct lipid traffic toward accumulation . accumulation of lipids is a biological process that fulfills several roles in microorganisms . in the case of tag and se oscm shift their metabolic machinery to generate a pool of ac coa as well as nadph which is the reducing power driving fatty acid fa synthesis forward the strategies vary among different classes of oscm and details will be discussed in the following sections . in the second stage ac coa is carboxylated to produce mal coa transferred to acyl carrier protein acp and further transformed into an acyl acp by sequential turns within the fatty acid synthase fas . in this stage further elongation and desaturation of the acyl chains may also occur and these phenomena vary throughout the different domains of life . in the case of archaea it is more common in prokaryotes to accumulate pha comprising specialized lipids such as poly3hydroxybutyrate p3hb polyhydroxyvalerate phv or copolymers such as poly3hydroxybutyrate co3hydroxyvalerate phbv . in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes accumulation of neutral lipids results in the formation of intracellular fat bodies typically called lipid droplets ld . in the case of polyhydroxyalkanoate accumulating prokaryotes they form ld which are also called lipid granules or carbonosomes . as described in later sections strategies for lipid accumulation in scm vary among the different types of scm and it is important to understand these differences to improve andor create productive strategies that can become economically as well as technologically feasible for the generation of biofuels as well as nutritional lipid metabolites such as long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids lc pufa . in yeasts oleaginicity depends on the ability to produce ac coa the necessary precursor of fatty acids in an effective manner . the diagram also includes the connection between fatty acid synthesis triacylglycerol synthesis and lipid droplet formation . abbreviations me malic enzyme cytosolic me 2 malic enzyme er membrane responsible for fatty acid desaturation acl atp citrate lyase i d isocitrate dehydrogenase nld nascent lipid droplet ld lipid droplet er endoplasmic reticulum lpa lysophosphatidic acid pa phosphatidic acid fas i fatty acid synthase i dag diacylglycerol tag triacylglycerol ampd amp deaminase . ac coa is converted by acetyl coa carboxylase acc to mal coa which is then used to synthesize fatty acids . the fatty acyl chain is built in a type i cytosolic fatty acid synthase fas i . for example ac coa is always the basis of fa biosynthesis and is the substrate of ketoacyl acp synthase ksa in bacteria . the sequence of reactions in yeast fas ii is condensation of ac coa with mal coa via ks reduction via ketoacyl reductase kr dehydration via a dehydratase dh and further reduction via enoyl reductase ear in a repetitive manner until palmitoyl acp is formed . in algae the acyl chain can be released in three ways depending on the cell s needs . it has been found that acs play a key role in regulating in each compartment the internal acyl coa pools by esterification of fa to coa . the final fatty acid composition of different types of microalgae is in great part dependent on the activity of these enzymes . in yeast acyl coas released from cytosolic fas i system there a series of esterifications to a g3p backbone occur also known as the kennedy pathway . examples of this strategy are the multifunctional caveolin protein which has been localized to both the plasma membrane and ld and dga1 the major enzyme catalyzing triacylglycerol synthesis . in most cases lipid accumulation strategies in microalgae and some single cell protists both primary and secondary endosymbionts follow the four stage lipid accumulation strategy described for yeast . further studies are demonstrating that lipid biosynthesis pathways in microalgae are not a simple mirror image of what happens in higher plants which have been more thoroughly studied . microalgae display plastidial and cytosolic acetyl coa pools which are key for lipid accumulation . in contrast yeast s main acetyl coa pool used for lipid accumulation is located in the cytosol . there is an additional acetyl coa pool present in mitochondria as well as a mitochondrial lipid biosynthesis pathway employing a type ii fas different from plastidial fas ii both in algae and in yeasts . for a review of mitochondrial lipid biosynthesis and its relevance in cell function plastids present in algae play a key role in de novo lipid biosynthesis for a review of plastid evolution and diversification see the work of keeling . it is possible that photosynthesis derived pyruvate is the major contributor to plastidial ac coa for de novo fatty acid synthesis . abbreviations er endoplasmic reticulum accase acetyl coa carboxylase acp acyl carrier protein dagat diacylglycerol acyltransferase dhap dihydroxyacetone phosphate enr enoyl acp reductase fat fatty acyl acp thioesterase g3pdh glycerol3phosphate dehydrogenase gpat glycerol3phosphate acyltransferase hd 3hydroxyacyl acp dehydratase kar 3ketoacyl acp reductase kas 3ketoacyl acp synthase lpaat lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase lpat lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase mat malonyl coa acp transacylase pdh pyruvate dehydrogenase complex . in microalgae the cytosolic ac coa pool is mainly fueled by the release of mitochondrial cit to the cytosol and further cleaved into oxaloacetate and ac coa by acl . concomitant production of nadph by me generates the reductive power necessary to drive plastidial de novo fatty acid synthesis forward . fatty acid synthesis is an energy demanding process due to the activity of elongases and desaturases . therefore it is possible to engineer high tag algal strains by eliminating competing carbon utilization pathways such as starch synthesis to maximize lipid biosynthesis . in algae the committed step in plastidial fatty acid synthesis is the conversion of plastidial ac coa to mal coa by acc1 . the acyl acp can be released from fas ii in several ways it can be hydrolyzed by a fatty acyl acp thioesterase located in the chloroplast envelope forming a free fatty acid or it can be transesterified from acp to coa via acs or it can even be coupled to either g3p or mag3p through an at in the chloroplast . several attempts have been made to overexpress specific enzymes in the lipid biosynthetic pathways . the released acyl moieties as free fatty acids destined to stay within the plastid may be further desaturated typically to hexadecatrienoic acid hdt c163n4 and coupled to a monogalactosyldiacylglycerol mgdg backbone . it has been suggested that dgts may have a role in lipid droplet formation similar to that of pc in higher plants . in both cases acyl coa is destined to leave the plastid and enter the er membrane for further oxygen dependent elongation and desaturation to become long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids lc pufa such as eicosapentaenoic acid epa and docosahexaenoic acid dha . in microalgae the most common pathways for epa and dha synthesis are the n3 and n6 pathways but variations of the theme occur . in most dha producing microalgae this is a different less complicated strategy for dha synthesis from epa compared to the sprecher pathway present in mammals which involves an additional elongation and a oxidation . in contrast to the n3 pathway some microalgae synthesize epa via the n6 pathway following 6 desaturation of la to linolenic acid gla elongation to dihomolinolenic acid dgla creation of a fourth double bond by 5 desaturase to produce arachidonic acid ara and a final desaturation to create epa via a n3 17 desaturase . thus microalgae can switch from n6 fatty acids to n3 fatty acids via the n3 15 desaturase and the n3 17 desaturase . the major free fas dpa 225n6 and dha 226n3 are then activated to acyl coa and incorporated into tags . however an acyl coa independent mechanism for triacylglycerol synthesis in some plants and yeast has been reported . this pathway uses pl as acyl donors and dag as the acceptor and the reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme phospholipid dag acyltransferase . triacylglycerol synthesis can also occur within the plastid through a series of acyl acp esterifications to plastidial g3p catalyzed by plastidial ats similar to the kennedy pathway in the er . the involvement of gg the major polar lipid family in plastidial membranes in several microalgae in this process remains to be elucidated . oleosins the major lipid droplet proteins present in plants are not present in green algae but a major lipid droplet protein was identified by applying proteomics in chlamydomonas and shown to modulate lipid droplet size . in bacteria the most frequent types of neutral and polymeric lipids synthesized and accumulated are pha tag wax esters we and to a lesser extent se . however a special situation occurs in bacteria such as rhodococcus ruber and other related bacteria capable of accumulating both types of lipids from unrelated carbon sources such as glucose . in most bacteria accumulation of tag and other neutral lipids such as we is stimulated by a carbon source present in excess together with limited nitrogen in the medium . structurally fluorescence staining experiments showed that lipid biosynthesis starts at peripheral lipid domains close to the cytoplasm membrane . biochemically fatty acid biosynthesis begins in bacteria with acc a heterotetrameric enzyme encoded by four genes acca accb accc and accd . ac coa is converted to mal coa and transferred to acp by malonyl coa acp transacylase fabd in bacteria to form malonyl acp . a first condensation of malonyl acp with acetyl coa by ketoacyl acp synthase iii fabh to form ketobutyryl acp and co2 initiates a cycle that can elongate the fatty acyl acp by two carbon units for each cycle until a saturated fatty acid of 16 or 18 carbons is made . in some bacteria fas ii yields unsaturated fatty acids which play a key role in bacterial membrane fluidity and function . unlike er desaturases present in microalgae or yeast which introduce double bonds into the completed fatty acid chains at the expense of oxygen the bacterial fas ii system can also desaturate fatty acids anaerobically because it does not require molecular oxygen . two genes faba and fabb are the key players in this pathway and occur together in bacteria that produce unsaturated fatty acids . the enzymes involved in the esterification of the glycerol moiety probably act via sequential acylation of the sn1 2 and 3 positions of g3p with the removal of the phosphate group occurring before the final acylation step . dag itself is also at a metabolic branchpoint that divides phospholipid and triacylglycerol formations because it acts as a precursor for tag pc and pe biosynthesis . in addition dag can also be derived from pl by the action of phospholipase c the distribution of acyl groups on the hydroxyl groups of the glycerol backbone is nonrandom as has been demonstrated for r. opacus pd630 . alternative pathways for triacylglycerol synthesis that do not involve dag in bacteria have also been reported and may involve an enzyme similar to that reported by dalquist in yeast which catalyzes the formation of tag from the transesterification of an acyl donor e.g. on a second pathway involving de novo fatty acid biosynthesis monomers of different lengths can be formed by transesterifying 3hydroxyacyl acp an intermediate of fas ii to 3hydroxyacyl coa presumably by the enzyme acyl acp coa transacylase encoded by phag . this enzyme is the key link between de novo fatty acid synthesis and polyhydroxyalkanoate biosynthesis . this pathway is of biotechnological interest because it helps generate monomers for polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis from structurally unrelated and simple inexpensive carbon sources such as glucose or related simple sugars . on a third embodiment monomers of different lengths can also be sourced from fatty acid oxidation pathway either by conversion of 2enoyl coa by an r specific enoyl coa hydratase encoded by phaj or by reduction of 3ketoacyl coa presumably by fabg or phab . in this case the ability of microorganisms to synthesize a particular form of polyhydroxyalkanoate is mainly due to the substrate specificity of polyhydroxyalkanoate synthases . this is a relevant step in the role of polyhydroxyalkanoate accumulation as a survival mechanism in the absence of suitable energy carbon sources as was demonstrated many years ago in r. eutropha . moreover archaea do not synthesize fatty acyl esters which are the most common constituents of ld instead their lipids are based on isoprenoid chains . the mechanisms of polyhydroxyalkanoate accumulation within archaea are beginning to be understood and work is underway to elucidate the type of proteins involved in archaeal polyhydroxyalkanoate accumulation . the authors concluded that the polyhydroxyalkanoate biosynthesis pathway from ac coa catalyzed by ketoacyl thiolase acetoacetyl coa reductase and polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase as distributed in bacteria likely also exists in the domain of archaea . microorganisms provide an exciting platform for the development of lipid technologies . the understanding of the biochemical and cellular mechanisms of lipid production accumulation and secretion will provide valuable insights on innovations to overcome the hurdles in microbial lipid utilization . in the field of energy and biofuels understanding the mechanisms by which each group of microorganisms generates highly combustible lipids will foster the production of cost effective fuels through sustainable processing and with improved performance . it is yet to be tested whether the biochemical mechanisms for amphipathic lipid secretion present in some microorganisms would work for the secretion of neutral lipids . microbial lipid technologies are a valuable toolset available for the future generation of scientists which will help them push the boundaries of production solutions ultimately toward a more sustainable society .", " arterial stiffness is determined by the properties of the arterial wall matrix and by vascular smooth muscle tone and may be changed immediately by an alteration in vascular smooth muscle tone caused by exercise 3 . exercise training induced alterations in arterial stiffness would be of great benefit to those with coronary artery disease cad and would potentially reduce myocardial oxygen demand and ischemic symptoms 4 . in the present study we investigated the effect of short duration exercise on arterial stiffness in patients with coronary artery disease by repeatedly measuring brachial ankle ba pulse wave velocity pwv an established non invasive means of assessing arterial stiffness . the cad group had a lower mean left ventricular ejection fraction a lower mean ldl cholesterol a higher bapwv and a shorter treadmill exercise duration than the control group . however this decrease was significantly larger in the cad group thus bapwv in the cad group was initially higher than in the control group but became similar after exercise . by multivariate analysis the cad group showed a larger decrease in bapwv after exercise than the control group after adjusting for age bmi sbp map map reduction and baseline bapwv table 4 . in the present study bapwv which was higher in the cad group at baseline was found to be reduced significantly at 10 min after exercise in both groups and because this decrease was larger in the cad group no difference in bapwv was observed between the two groups after exercise . these observations suggest that short duration exercise affects arterial stiffness even in patients with cad . however exercise duration is longer and the proportional change of bapwv is smaller in control group and moreover exercise duration is not correlated to both absolute and relative change of bapwv data not shown . because as mentioned above cad group members were taking more medications it is unclear whether our findings suggest that patients with stable cad have the potential to reverse arterial stiffness with exercise despite the presence of disease or whether they reflect an effect of the medications taken such as aspirin blocker renin angiotensin system inhibitor and hmg coa reductase inhibitor . however considering the higher baseline bapwv value in the cad group it appears that medications do not completely normalize arterial stiffness in cad patients and that short duration exercise seems to independently improve arterial stiffness immediately . still it is rather puzzling that cad patients showed more prominent reduction in bapwv than control group and resulted in similar level of bapwv after exercise . this group of patients has higher baseline bapwv due to the endothelial dysfunction but much of this functional abnormality might be reversible by some intervention such as short duration exercise in this study . though our study showed immediate short term response to exercise evidence is scarce on whether repeated short duration exercise may result in a persistent and long term improvement of arterial stiffness . in conclusion in the present study we prospectively investigated the effects of short duration exercise on arterial stiffness by measuring bapwv in patients with or without cad . these observations suggest that short duration exercise training may be effective at improving arterial stiffness even in patients with coronary artery disease at least in short term . clinical study is needed to see whether repeated short duration exercise will improve arterial stiffness in cad patients in long term .", " with cataract surgery regarded as the most widely performed surgical procedure a demand exists for continued innovation and technology . the latest highlights in technology include advances in preoperative and intraoperative diagnostics femtosecond laser assisted cataract surgery flacs and a new generation of intraocular lenses iols . physicians now have access to advanced diagnostics that can better quantify conditions such as dry eye light scatter and posterior corneal astigmatism . therefore increased interest among ophthalmologists to utilize objective measurements to assess the ocular surface exists . evaluation of optical quality also aids in decision making between corneal or lens based procedures . these data allow clinicians to evaluate the quality of a patient s optical system objectively . both anterior and posterior corneal astigmatism should be taken into account in iol planning particularly in patients desiring astigmatic correction . patients were 2.4 times more likely to have less than 0.50 d of residual refractive astigmatism when intraoperative aberrometry was used . the authors concluded that measurement precision is limiting reliability of intraoperative aberrometry and application to routine cataract surgery . this technology is particularly useful in postrefractive patients and those with astigmatism uncertainty or other corneal pathology . it can provide an objective evaluation of macular function and could be useful in influencing lens selection for patients with conditions such as epiretinal membrane diabetic retinopathy and age related macular degeneration . potential advantages include customized corneal incisions and capsulotomy position precision in shape and size of capsulotomy custom lens fragmentation patterns endothelial cell loss reduction and better refractive stability and predictability . they reported that this technology provides sufficient predictability outcomes in postrefractive myopic lasik even though a small hyperopic shift tendency was noted in the study . thus even though high repeatability was present and the iol powers were not statistically different between the two devices the values provided by the galilei g6 were not interchangeable with the lenstar in the clinical setting . variability in materials optical properties and designs are important factors to consider in the patient specific selection of an iol . the concept of adjustable iols involves the correction of residual refractive error postoperatively or customization after lens implantation . this new paradigm in iol manufacturing may be subdivided into two major categories a modular multicomponent category requiring a separate intraocular procedure and another category where the optic is adjusted postoperatively with a secondary device . the future of refractive cataract surgery is exciting in time these new technologies may be the standard of care .", " studies in the last decade have shown that the majority of patients with epilepsy will be urgently admitted to secondary and tertiary care institutions mostly through the ed at some point in the history of their illness and a significant proportion will require multiple visits . despite the heavy burden of seizures in the ed international studies suggest that the majority of patients are referred unnecessarily for admission and that the acute treatment of seizures is often ineffective indicating that seizure admissions are a cause of unnecessary medical intervention delayed diagnosis and prolonged length of stay 5 6 . on the basis of two baseline audits we identified a number of areas where we could improve the quality of service to patients with seizures by the employment of an evidence based seizure care pathway in the emergency department ed and acute medical admissions unit amau . the study consisted of three parts retrospective audit of admissions with seizures through the emergency department in 2004 . measurement of quality and safety metrics after the implementation of an evidence based seizure care pathway from november 2008 to november 2009 . these patients were identified through the hospital in patient enquiry hipe system a national coding system for hospital discharges in ireland which identified 341 patients with epilepsy or seizure as the primary reason for admission . after the baseline audits a seizure care pathway was designed and implemented by the neurology service with the cooperation of the ed staff . in addition to patients discharged from wards and the ed this clinic also reviewed new referrals from gps and patients with an established diagnosis of epilepsy who had exacerbations of their illness all of which were designed to avoid ed referrals . patients were managed according to a locally designed evidence based seizure care pathway figure 1 . 350 patients who presented to ed between november 2008 and november 2009 with seizures and other forms of collapse were referred to the seizure team for assessment and had the seizure care pathway applied . 97 patients had an established history of either generalised or focal epilepsy and 72 patients had epilepsy associated with significant medical and surgical comorbidities . 64 patients 18 were seen in the subspecialty epilepsy clinic and median follow up time for this more stable group was 8 weeks . the aim of this study was to demonstrate improvements in for patients presenting to the ed with seizures and related disorders without compromising safety by the use of an evidence based seizure care pathway . the main findings of the study are that through the utilization of the seizure care pathway the ed and amau can reduce unnecessary admissions and safely discharge patients for early follow up which has a very significant impact on reducing representation rates . all of these outcomes were significant statistically and support the use of care pathways for patients presenting to the ed with seizures without any increase in mortality . it has been suggested that admission of seizure patients is only warranted in patients who are at high risk of further events remain drowsy or comatose following a period in the ed or in whom the neurological exam reveals signs indicative of an underlying lesion or treatable infective cause . comparison of hipe data between 2004 with that of 2009 following implementation of the seizure care pathway shows a reduction in the number of admissions with a specific diagnosis of epilepsy from 2.9 341 of total hospital admissions to 2.2 276 . had admissions continued at the rate of 2.9 with no seizure care pathway in place it would have resulted in 365 epilepsy related admissions in 2009 suggesting that 89 epilepsy specific admissions were avoided due to implementation of the seizure care pathway in 2008 to 2009 . reductions in length of stay secondary to implementation of care pathways have been reported in other areas of heath care but not in the case of patients with seizures 1113 . it may be due to a combination of more timely and effective inpatient management including the delivery of inpatient ens education the provision of phone and e mail advice services the use of rapid access to ambulatory clinics for exacerbations of existing epilepsy and improved timely communication with primary care teams . in relation to the overall safety of the seizure service with its emphasis on reducing admissions and length of stay we found that only three of the 19 deaths in the study group were directly attributable to epilepsy . during the intervention study the involvement of early specialist opinion allowed for the streamlining of those who required eeg which occurred on the day of admission in approximately 54 of the study group and in total over 90 had the test done in 3 days or less . in this study we complimented the retrospective audit with a short prospective audit which validated some of the retrospective audit and independently verified characteristics of patients admitted with epilepsy and their course in hospital . it appears that a large proportion of seizure related presentations are referred to the in house medical or neurological teams for admission due in large part to the lack of access to appropriate algorithms for admission and decision support for early treatment and diagnostic investigation and the difficulty in obtaining outpatient investigations and specialist epilepsy follow up in a reasonable length of time . this study conducted over a 12 month period using baseline data collected between 2004 and 2006 shows that using an evidence based care pathway with early specialist advice and follow up along with directed patients education and a range of communication tools to aid in self management such as telephone and e mail advice can contribute significantly to quality and value improvements in epilepsy care without compromising safety .", " forty three patients in the tb group were sputum smear positive and the rest were sputum smear negative . the patho tb test was performed as the manufacturer brochure s following stages 1 sample decontamination and neutralization the sputum sample was treated for decontamination by the kubica method in which 2 ml of sample was put in a 50 ml conical centrifuge tube . at least 0.2 ml aliquot of the re suspended pellet was kept

samples following the procedure presented in the following section . the sensitivity of sputum smear examination was 64 versus 90 in patho tb test but the specificity was 100 versus 70 . the sensitivity of patho tb test in sputum smear positive and negative ptb was 93 and 83 respectively . most of these patients are living in underdeveloped countries of the world.10 the incidence of total ptb and sputum smear positive ptb were estimated about 53.4 and 22.4 per 100000 respectively in the study region during 2006.11 the definite diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis is difficult because of low sensitivity of sputum direct examination . despite the low cost and easy performance of direct sputum smear microscopy it has a sensitivity of 61.3 63.4 and specificity of 97.3 97.4 and is being used as the primary diagnostic test for the diagnosis of ptb.12 culture requires several weeks to provide results and other complex tests such as pcr are expensive and rarely available in low income countries . the most commonly used antigens are lipoarabinomannan lam mycodot serologic test antigen 5 38 kda pathozyme tb elisa test and ict diagnostics lam and 38 kda pathozyme myco elisa test a60 antigen antigen a60 elisa test 4547 kda antigen kp90 antigen 30 kda antigen p32 antigen and some other antigens.the standard methods used for those different antigen assays include sandwich elisa inhibition elisa latex agglutination and reverse passive hemagglutination tests.1416 dipstick method had a sensitivity and specificity of 93 and 95 respectively.17 recently it was reported that patho tb test has a reasonable sensitivity and specificity . among 310 tb patients the sensitivity of patho tb was 91.1 comparing to direct examination that was 91.8 and the specificity was 85.5 versus 100.18 direct examination in that study was done by auramine staining which was confirmed by ziehl neelsen in positive specimens but in the present study only ziehl neelsen staining for direct examination was performed . in the present study the sensitivity of patho tb test was 90 in contrast with 64.1 for the direct smear method . positive tuberculin skin test in our study also did not show any significant difference and the results of diagnostic performance characteristics were much lower than patho tb test results . higher sensitivity of this new rapid flow through method comparing to direct smear microscopy of afb might enable using patho tb test for rapid diagnosis of ptb as a screening test along with traditional diagnostic tests . positive predictive values of the test are low therefore patients with positive patho tb test need a confirmatory test such as sputum culture to confirm the diagnosis of ptb . further studies on larger number of sputum smear negative ptb patients are required to clear the characteristic performance of patho tb test .", " a 14year old domestic shorthair cat was treated for transient diabetes mellitus for 3 months with glargine insulin which was discontinued when the diabetes mellitus resolved . six months later the cat re presented for relapse of its diabetes mellitus and an intradermal skin challenge with 120 diluted insulin was performed confirming a hypersensitivity to glargine . the cat continues to be well regulated on porcine zinc insulin without any hypersensitivity reactions noted . this is the first reported case of a hypersensitivity reaction secondary to glargine insulin in a cat . clinicians should be aware of this potential complication particularly in animals with a previous history of insulin administration and the potential to utilize intradermal testing with insulin . the purpose of this case report is to describe the clinical manifestation and management of a cat with an hr to subcutaneous glargine insulin gi administration . the cat had a history of diabetes mellitus dm which was first treated with gi in 2013 . the cat was treated for diabetes which became transient after 3 months of treatment . a blood glucose bg was not obtained but the cat was given dextrose submucosally as there were concerns about a hypoglycemic crisis . blood work performed on admission revealed hyperglycemia 666 mg dl ri 75116 mg dl hypokalemia 3.36 meq l ri 3.624.60 treatment for her gastrointestinal signs consisted of maropitant 1 mg kg sc q24h dolestron 0.6 mg kg iv q24h and ampicillin 20 mg kg iv q8h.the cat continued to experience a large volume of diarrhea and hematochezia over the first 24 h after admission but the vomiting resolved . during hospitalization the bg continued to be monitored and ranged from 107355 mg dl the cat s appetite remained poor . the cat was kept overnight for monitoring and was noted to be painful and intermittently pruritic over the injection site . appearance of a cutaneous lesion within 60 mins of injection indicates a type i hr as exhibited by the cat in this case whereas a type iii or iv hr would be suggested by a response seen between 2 and 24 h. human protocols were used as intradermal testing with insulin had never been performed in a cat prior to this . it is unknown if such abnormalities are identified in cases of feline insulin hr the abdominal ultrasound performed in the cat reported here failed to identify any gall bladder abnormalities . poor injection technique or improper storage of insulin was not considered likely as the owners had successfully managed the cat s dm for 3 years . in the cat corticosteroids and epinephrine have been recommended for hrs in veterinary patients but were considered potentially contraindicated given the pre existing dm severe hyperglycemia and potential to cause ketosis . the owners had also successfully managed the cat s dm for 3 years and were well versed in subcutaneous administration of insulin so poor technique does not seem likely . clinicians should be aware of the possibility of hrs to insulin administration in cats particularly in cats with a previous history of insulin administration .", " national institute of health and the american college of obstetrician and gynecologists recommended a single course of corticosteroids for pregnant women between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation who are at risk of preterm delivery within 7 days.56 the use of tocolytic agents to suppress preterm uterine contraction can delay delivery for at least 48 hours and this prolongation enable the complete administration of corticosteroids to obtain their maximum effect for gestational age of 2434 weeks.6 despite of the available modalities to prevent preterm birth and its consequences the proportions of preterm birth are not reduced.7 therefore we planned to evaluate the success rate of preterm uterine contraction inhibition with tocolytic agents and factors associated with inhibition failure to aware the possibility of preterm delivery . we have reviewed the medical records of all singleton pregnant women between 24 and 33 weeks of gestation admitted to the labor room of srinagarind hospital khon kaen university thailand between january 2013 and july 2014 and selected the patients who received uterine contraction inhibition with tocolytic drugs under diagnosis of preterm labor or threatened preterm labor . so the success of preterm uterine contraction inhibition was assessed as the delay in delivery for at least 48 hours after tocolytics administration between 24 and 33 week of gestation while the inhibition failure was defined as the delay in delivery for 48 hours . the sample size calculation based on the objective to assess the success rate of preterm uterine contraction inhibition with the maximal proportion of defined women was 0.5 and 10 of allowance error . the study required at least 96 singleton pregnant women who admitted to the labor room with preterm uterine contraction and received tocolytic agents for inhibition . during the studied period a total of 424 pregnant women met the diagnosis of preterm labor or threatened preterm labor . in table 2 the overall success rate of preterm uterine contraction inhibition for prolongation of pregnancy at least for 48 hours was 86.4 . similar to the authors present results motazedian et al reported that a 48hour prolongation of pregnancy was achieved in 87 patients receiving terbutaline and 84 patients receiving salbutamol.10 likewise the study at siriraj hospital bangkok thailand revealed that the success rate in threatened preterm labor inhibition for 12 hours with nifedipine was about 80.11 however in cases of women with advanced cervical dilatation 48 cm who received one or more tocolytics magnesium sulfate indomethacin or nifedipine only 23 could prolong pregnancy at least 48 hours after admission.12 similarly in cases of women with the diagnosis of preterm labor based on the presence of uterine contraction with documented cervical change success rate by nifedipine was 70.13 in these two studies with the lower success rates the patients presented as preterm labor with apparent cervical changes . we noticed that regardless of number and the type of tocolysis the success rate was higher when uterine contraction inhibition was applied to women with preterm uterine contraction without cervical changes . furthermore the authors data revealed that preterm labor uterine contraction with cervical change was the significant risk factor of labor inhibition failure . in spite of the success rate of preterm uterine contraction inhibition was as high as 86.4 in this study for example the mean birth weight of babies was approximately 2300 g and a half of them had low birth weight 2500 g . regarding the evaluation of pregnancy outcomes of uterine contraction inhibition with tocolytic agents further research on threatened preterm labor with or without tocolysis would be necessary . the success rate of preterm uterine contraction inhibition with tocolytic agents to delay delivery for at least 48 hours was high in threatened preterm labor and low in preterm labor . a significant risk factor for inhibition failure was the preterm uterine contraction with cervical change .", " achalasia is a primary esophageal motor disorder of unknown etiology characterized by selective loss of inhibitory neurons in the esophageal wall resulting in insufficient relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter and loss of esophageal peristalsis.12 jackhammer esophagus is a newly introduced term to describe patients with at least 20 of the swallows with distal contractile integral dci 8000 mmhg.sec.cm.3 several reports have described patients with diffuse esophageal spasm des non specific esophageal motor disorder nsemd nutcracker esophagus and gastroesophageal reflux disease gerd progressing to achalasia.49 although no causal relationship has been identified these reports suggest that the different esophageal motor disorders represent a spectrum rather than unique and stable disorders . we describe for the first time a case of a patient who progressed from jackhammer esophagus to type ii achalasia . to our knowledge this is the first case that describes progression of jackhammer esophagus to achalasia over a period of about one year . several reports describe the progression of des to achalasia.68 khatami et al10 conducted the first prospective cohort study with 12 patients . they observed the progression of des to achalasia in only one patient after 10.6 years . five 14 of the patients progressed to achalasia at a mean follow up of 2.1 years . anggianash et al9 described the progression of nutcracker esophagus to achalasia in one patient after 3 years . this case also demonstrates the importance of following patients who were diagnosed with non achalasia motility disorders with a repeat hrem in one year to assess for progression or a shift to a different esophageal motility disorder . perhaps with the current availability of hrem researchers may be able to identify predictive factors associated with progression of certain esophageal motility disorders to achalasia .", " at the time of writing figure 1.international cancer genome consortium icgc projects

bleeding from large rectal varices that could not be controlled by tips placement despite normalization of the portosystemic pressure gradient . we report this case to highlight and discuss potential pitfalls of tips placement when using this technique to treat rectal variceal bleeding . this case highlights two potential pitfalls of tips placement when using this technique in the treatment of rectal variceal bleeding . recurrent bleeding from rectal varices after tips placement may be related to the large size of the varices . some authors advocate embolization of the rectal varices at the time of tips placement even if normalization of portal hypertension is achieved 7 10 . given the successful control of bleeding following embolization in our case concomitant variceal embolization at the time of tips placement may be necessary to control massive bleeding especially when the rectal varices are large . since the first application of a tips in the treatment of recurrent bleeding from anorectal varices in 1993 a tips alone or a tips combined with variceal embolization has been reported to be useful in controlling such bleeding without significant morbidity or mortality 2 3 4 5 10 . although emergent tips placement can be the last resort to control massive bleeding from rectal varices even in high risk patients it must be used cautiously because it can lead to life threatening complications as seen in our case . although reports on the use of this technique for bleeding rectal varices are limited it could be useful in controlling an initial acute bleeding and in stabilizing a patient without affecting liver function . in conclusion although tipss have been reported to be useful in controlling bleeding from rectal varices there are potential pitfalls in using this technique to treat rectal variceal bleeding .", " it was several years after the first mutations had been identified in the app and psen genes in ad that the first mutations were identified in a subset of ftld tau ftdp17 where they were found in exonic and intronic sequences of the mapt gene that encodes tau . in this paper we will be discussing a few selected tau transgenic mouse models with memory and motor phenotypes and how one of these the k369i mutant human tau expressing k3 strain has been employed in an enu modifier screen outlining the strategy from breeding to gene identification . as the focus of this review article is the application of enu mutagenesis to one of our mutant tau transgenic mouse strains k3 we will be comparing this particular strain with a few other tau transgenic strains we have established in the past . what has the ambition been in developing transgenic mouse strains for the tau pathology of ad in the first place the aim has always been to authentically model the human pathology and to gain a deeper understanding of what causes tau pathology how this is related to neurodegeneration and functional impairment and ultimately how pathogenic processes can be prevented or delayed . we succeeded in reproducing this distinct pathology fully in the k3 mice that express k369i mutant tau . with the pr5 and the k3 mice we do have two complementary models at hand that present themselves for therapeutic intervention both strains are characterized by hyperphosphorylation and increased insolubility of tau as well as silver positive inclusions gallyas positive nfts in the case of r5 mice and bielschowsky positive inclusions predominantly resembling pick bodies in k3 mice . while in the ad and ageing field mouse strains are available with traits that arose spontaneously and have been further established by specific breeding programs such as the senescence accelerated sam mice the rate at which new models arise spontaneously means that even with a concerted effort discovery is on an asymptomatic trajectory towards a phenotype gap . by expanding the library of alleles with chemical mutagenesis using n ethyl n nitosourea enu identification of each of the single nucleotide changes that result in a particular phenotype is feasible in mice and is now providing novel insights into not only immunity where this approach has been used widely but also the functioning of the brain . genomewide random mutagenesis with the ethylating chemical enu provides a way to produce and screen genetic variants in the mouse . we have been investigating a phenotype modulation of our k3 mice by crossing enu male founder mice with k3 females as discussed hereinafter . here and in general dominant mutations are expected to manifest in the first generation offspring g1 while recessive mutations are brought to homozygosity in g3 mice by either g1 . assuming a 1600 cm 2.6 gb haploid mouse genome of which approximately 1.5 is coding this comes down to approximately 50 functional mutations in each g1 . for example one study found that 113 g1 mice contained lethal mutations in the balancer chromosome 11 region that contains 5 of the genome with the consequence that 18 of the g3 population will not survive because of lethal mutations . for phenotype driven strategies such as a motor phenotype see the following f1 and f3 mice are examined for dominant acting and recessive acting mutations respectively 23 82 . we initiated an enu mutagenesis program in k3 mice that generated transgene dependent and independent pedigrees . in the following we will be discussing five pedigrees enu164 partial rescue transgene related enu67 slow weight gain transgene related enu37 circling not transgene related enu1230a motor phenotype not transgene related and enu16069 motor phenotype not transgene related . to first establish that the k3 phenotype is fully penetrant on the background chosen for enu mutagenesis we established backcrosses with 20 mice each using c57bl10 c3h h3h fvb c57led and balb b mice all of which are established enu strains at the apf australian phenomics facility canberra . we decided to use balb b as the strain for enu mutagenesis as the k3 phenotype of parkinsonism is fully penetrant on this background both with regards to phenotype and age of onset . therefore balb b males were injected with enu and paired with the k3 mice that are on a c57bl6 background and the f1 offspring was analyzed . any mice exhibiting all three phenotypes and genotyped k3tau positive were culled as were any mice failing to display any of the phenotypes and genotyped k3tau negative . mice which showed a genotype phenotype mismatch were genotyped a second time for confirmation and phenotyped for up to 3 months . any mice which did not display the phenotype until after 5 weeks of age were also noted as having delayed onset of the phenotype and were flagged as a putant potential mutant of interest . we would like to make the comment that while previously we have been mapping the enu mutations down to a chromosomal region for most strains these days it is much faster to directly next generation sequence the exomes of one to two affected mice instead . hereinafter we will be discussing five pedigrees for which we have arrived at different stages of out crossing and identification of the underlying gene mutations starting with those pedigrees with which we have the least progressed . enu164 pedigreethis pedigree is characterized by a partial rescue of the parkinsonism phenotype that characterizes the k3 mice because some transgene positive mice in the pedigree showed an improvement in our vigorous weekly scorings for example at week 6 they would show a scoring of 121 for gait clasp tremor instead of 343 as is typical for k3 mice . as mentioned above consecutive backcrossing onto c57bl6 reduces the number of functional enu induced point mutations such that in the 3rd generation f3 they are reduced to 3 4 mutations . as the k3 mice have been generated on a c57bl6 background while enu mutagenesis has been on a balb b inbred genetic background strain specific snp detection enabled the genomic mapping of the causative mutation location on the balb b background . this pedigree is characterized by a partial rescue of the parkinsonism phenotype that characterizes

that point mutations in the tbx1 gene can also cause the disorder . the analysis of engineered mouse mutants developing a phenotype resembling digeorge syndrome has revealed genes and signalling pathways crucial for this process . with regards to ad furthermore string 9.0 known and predicted protein protein interactions for tbx1 identify sept5 which is also among 29 genes that are deregulated in pr5 tau transgenic mice jg and lim manuscript submitted . the value of the enu37 strain lies in the absence of a perinatal phenotype which allows for studies which are not feasible with the complete knockout . there is evidence that point mutations in the tbx1 gene can also cause the disorder . the analysis of engineered mouse mutants developing a phenotype resembling digeorge syndrome

complete knockout is a model of jnls but the mice show an additional circling shaker waltzer and rapid head blobbing phenotype . enu16069 pedigree in short enu16with minimal stress enu16 mice display a mild action tremor . a second strain is available from jackson laboratories b6.cgmpzgrsrj mice carry the spontaneous totterer mutation . we found however by immunohistochemistry and western blot

spontaneous totterer mutation . we found however by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis that the mutated protein p0 n121 g is expressed at a pattern and at levels similar to wild type . this overview of pedigrees with motor phenotypes reveals that mice are amenable to enu mutagenesis and that it is possible to establish interesting phenotypes . compared to the functional genomics approaches we have pursued in the past 99102 enu mutagenesis is more directed as it not only identifies gene mutations that modulate an existing pathology but also has the added advantage of establishing mutant mouse strains at the same time . what are the challenges of enu mutagenesis in transgenic models of neurodegeneration and what issues both practical and conceptual did we encounter while doing these studies in hindsight it appears to have been the preferred strategy to start with as many enu mutagenised males for cross breeding with k3 mice as possible in order to saturate the genome with mutations . we still believe that there is a potential in applying enu mutagenesis to mouse models .", "", " however the usefulness of icg fluorescence angiography is limited when the microscopic view is poorly visualized or when icg can not absorb sufficient light to emit fluorescence . thus icg fluorescence angiography would be very useful to supplement the shortcomings of microscopic icg fluorescence . to date there are 3 clinical reports regarding endoscopic icg fluorescence angiography from japan and europe51114 . we independently developed an endoscopic camera system for icg fluorescence angiography that can show the real time simultaneous visible and fluorescent imaging . the endoscopic icg system consists of an endoscope a light source a camera a display and a computer with software fig . to simultaneously obtain the visible and icg fluorescence images we used a fluorescence navigation surgery fns camera developed by korea electrotechnology research institute keri fig . the endoscopic icg system consists of an endoscope a light source a camera a display and a computer with software fig . to simultaneously obtain the visible and icg fluorescence images we used a fluorescence navigation surgery fns camera developed by korea electrotechnology research institute keri fig . visible color and icg fluorescent endoscopic images of cortical vessels were simultaneously observed on the display monitor with a high resolution . since raabe et al.17 introduced microscopic icg fluorescence angiography for cerebrovascular surgery in 2003 it has become a ubiquitous piece of equipment for aneurysm surgery as well as micro anastomosis and surgery for arteriovenous fistulas and malformations . to overcome the drawbacks of microscopic icg angiography in fact endoscopic icg angiography has been applied in other surgical fields before it was introduced in the field of neurosurgery based on the property of icg which is circulated through the blood vessels metabolized in the liver and excreted via the bile duct into the intestines . meanwhile the use of endoscopic icg angiography in aneurysm surgery has recently been introduced5614 . moreover it is possible in the endoscopic icg angiography to better magnify the areas of interest5 obtain longer icg fluorescence duration and be more useful in the ruptured aneurysms11 compared to the microscopic system . light illumination from microscopy alone the advantage of our endoscopic icg angiography system is that icg fluorescence and visible color imaging can be simultaneously visualized and merged in a real time manner . previous microscopic or endoscopic icg angiography systems can not help but to demonstrate the visible color or nir fluorescence imaging one at a time such that surgeons may feel some difficulty in comparing the real structures with fluorescence images during the surgery . different from the previous systems it was possible to simultaneously display visible color and icg fluorescent images and make a real time merging images of them .", " in nigeria lawan reported 14.8 of patients attending their teaching hospital eye clinic presenting with red eye . studies done in port harcourt and ile ife in nigeria showed that red eye accounted for 19.61 and 54.9 of pediatric ophthalmic eye diseases respectively . in a study done in ile ife nigeria among pediatric age group ocular trauma was the most common cause of red eye followed by allergic conjunctivitis and infections of the eye and its adnexa . studies carried out in developing countries of sub saharan africa showed a sub optimal level of knowledge attitude and perception of ocular conditions and eye health in general . in cape coast ghana a study of the eye care seeking behavior of the populace showed 23.3 of respondents having practiced self medication during the last episode of eye disorder whereas 5.5 visited a traditional healer . no previous study has examined the perception and practice of senior secondary ss school students in sagamu concerning the red eye . this study therefore planned to determine the attitude of ss school students in sagamu local government to red eye . the result will be useful to health planners in planning interventional programs to reduce blindness and visual impairment from red eye within the local government area lga state and the country at large and in the other developing countries . the questionnaire obtained information on sociodemographic data perception and attitude toward red eye from respondents . the questionnaire obtained information on sociodemographic data perception and attitude toward red eye from respondents . demographic characteristics of respondents majority 81 had heard of red eye and this was mainly from neighbors table 2 whereas 216 19 had not . perception of red eye was associated with age p 0.027 and class p 0.001 . the factors associated with attitude toward red eye are shown in table 3 this is statically significant for class p 0.001 . in this study majority heard about red eye from neighbors which show the impact of community on people s health . only 13.6 were aware that red eye could be caused by infections which may also influence their attitude to red eye . most 96.2 respondents attitude toward red eye was poor a finding quite different from that reported in kano where 52.8 of students had a poor attitude toward severe ocular disorders . the observed difference might be due to the fact that this study focused solely on red eyes whereas the study carried out in kano assessed knowledge and attitude toward causes of blindness and its prevention . health education done in schools during assembly especially by eye care workers will go a long way to help reduce this among the students and in the communities as these children will in turn tell their parents about what they are taught at school . perception grade and attitude of this population were poor this may mean that the perception and attitude to red eye even though very common is low in the general population as the students are actually reflecting what they have learnt from their homes . we therefore conclude that secondary school students in sagamu have poor perception and attitude to red eye . appropriate eye health services and education should be included in school health services and early presentation to eye care centers for its treatment should be encouraged .", " in 1637 probably for the first time in europe was described by the portugese physician zacatus lusitanus the treatment of sciatic pain by cauterization of the ear after that bloodletting had failed . in 1957 dr paul nogier a physician resident in lyons france first presented his observations of the somatotopic correspondences of the ear . auriculotherapy following nogier s theory uses the ear to help determine whether the right and left hemispheres of the brain are functioning as a dynamic whole whether there are specific neurological musculo skeletal or organ systems that are in imbalance and whether there are any blockages to treatment such as scar tissue or emotional disorders and it should be a new diagnostic system too 23 . after learning about the nogier ear charts in 1958 a massive study was initiated by the nanjing army ear acupuncture research team . the outcome of that research was very positive and resulted in the utilization of this therapy by the was published an ear chart remarkably similar to that of dr nogier in 1958 4 . nogier acknowledged that chinese traditional medicine had been using ear points for acupuncture prior to his discovery but these had been considered empirical points for particular treatments and were not associated with a somatotopic representation of the homunculus in the ear . later the american physician td oleson has published a very important paper that is a real milestone in ear acupuncture 5 . to experimentally evaluate the claims by french and chinese ear acupuncture that a somatotopic mapping of the body was represented in the external ear 40 patients were examined to determine areas of their body where there was musculoskeletal pain . in the last years modern clinical and basic research is confirming the efficacy of ear acupuncture mostly in the treatment of pain both acute and chronic 69 and of anxiety related disorders 1012 . auricolotherapy is a treatment diffusing in all over the world and its patterns follow the principles of chinese acupuncture revised and updated with chinese maps of the ear the principles of paul nogier and also the principles of reflexology basing on somatotopic maps that do not recognize energetic based stimulation while just the evocation of a reflex stimulating precise areas of the ear moreover are used for stimulation of ear skin many different tools finger acupressure laser electricity different types of needles magnetic balls seeds . actually one of the many methodological problems with auricular acupuncture is that there are so many maps of the ear and little agreement exists regarding point location lacking definitive anatomic study on ear skin and its somatotopic correspondences .", " 1996 presents health care expenditure data in an accounting structure that describes the size current growth and historical trends of health care by service matched against the sources that pay the health care bill such as private health insurance phi and government programs like medicaid and medicare . business households and government finance health care bill payers through taxes premium payments for both private and public health insurance and general revenues these sectors also make direct payments to providers . for 1990 through 1995 we will present statistics on how much each sponsor spent on health care and the impact of these expenditures on their ability to pay . since 1993 a combination of slower health care cost growth and an upswing in the economy has stabilized or eased the burden that business households and government faced in financing health care . business especially is benefiting from the changing health care cost environment . by 1991 business spent 249.4 billion on health care in 1995 including 183.8 billion for employer sponsored health insurance . also enrollment in managed care plans grew . one factor contributing to the premium cost shift from employers to employees was the migration of covered workers into lower cost managed care plans such as health maintenance organizations preferred provider organizations and point of service plans . the switch to managed care affected the level of household out of pocket payments . this coincides with the increased enrollment in managed care plans that have lower deductibles and copayments than traditional fee for service plans . the portion of federal government revenues financing health care costs declined slightly in 1994 and 1995 after several years of significant growth .", "", " the patient presented to the department with dull pain and facial swelling in relation to lower left molar region extending to the angle of mandible . coronal and axial ct images demonstrate left bmc oriented anteroposteriorly with articular surface irregularity the second patient was a 12year old female patient referred for ct examination for evaluation of mild facial asymmetry and suspected tmj ankylosis . she had a reduced degree of jaw opening since childhood and subsequently developed midline deviation to the left along with difficulty in mastication . these images demonstrated sagittal splitting of the left mandibular condyle into medial and lateral condylar head . the second patient was a 12year old female patient referred for ct examination for evaluation of mild facial asymmetry and suspected tmj ankylosis . she had a reduced degree of jaw opening since childhood and subsequently developed midline deviation to the left along with difficulty in mastication . these images demonstrated sagittal splitting of the left mandibular condyle into medial and lateral condylar head . but here in our patient we have seen that there was a history of trauma for the mediolaterally splitted condyle and the anteroposterior splitting was because of osteomyelitis and the patient denied any previous trauma in all her life . have suggested that when two condylar parts lie in the sagittal plane trauma is indicated as the cause and when the parts lie in the coronal plane the persistence of the fibrous septa at the condylar cartilage is likely to be the cause . in this case report as postulated above groove formation and presence of medial and lateral head of both condyles clearly demonstrated the formation of the bmc . in summary bmc an anatomic variation of condyle is a rare anomaly whose etiology is unknown .", " diagnosis of glaucoma was based on both the presence of typical glaucomatous changes in the optic disc and

diseases compared to normal population and according to some studies one in every 5 patients with diabetes suffer from depression 5 6 . in khamseh study 71.8 of patients with diabetes had major depression 8 and in sepehrmanesh study in kashan this rate was 57.7 among women and 41 among men 9 . depression is associated with increased risk of high blood glucose complications of diabetes cardiovascular diseases and possibly patient s reduced compliance too 11 14 . various studies have shown that unlike normal people patients with diabetes have lower quality of life and this is much more pronounced in those suffering from complications of diabetes depression also has a significant effect on patients quality of life 16 18 . comorbidity of depression and diabetes can have a cumulative effect on people s functions 20 . reported that depression was not diagnosed in 45 of diabetic patients 21 . reported that depressed patients are unable to comply with dietary regimen or manage blood glucose and in this respect they are clearly different from non depressed patients 23 . with regard to the effect of diabetes with depression on the quality of life in 2004 filakovic et al . demonstrated that comorbidity of depression with diabetes further lowers patients quality of life by many folds 24 although several studies have been conducted on either quality of life or depression in diabetic patients there are few studies on the relationship between quality of life and depression in diabetic patients . moreover given that failure to diagnose depression in diabetic patients is commonplace the need to identify and screen psychiatric disorders in patients with chronic diseases especially diabetes and the impact of depression on the quality of life this article aimed to investigate the relationship between depression and quality of life in patients with diabetes using medical records at diabetics clinic in gorgan . according to ethics committee guidelines study 25 the correlation between the depression and quality of life r 0.39 95 confidence interval and 90 power test 66 diabetic patients with depression were needed . to achieve that and with respect

and reliability of whoqol bref have been reported favorable in many native and foreign studies 17 30 32 . the prevalence of depression in all diabetic patients was 58.2 of whom 124 patients 64.6 had mild depression 56 29.2 moderate depression and 12 6.2 severe depression . depression was observed in 45.1 of the single diabetic patients and in 60.6 of married ones with significant difference p 0.039 . more than 50 of depressed diabetic patients and 62.5 of non depressed diabetic patients were literate and the difference between two groups was significant . comparison of the relationship between clinical characteristics and depression in patients with diabetes showed insignificant differences between the two groups with respect to dietary regimen diabetes complications retinopathy neuropathy and nephropathy and duration of the disease . comparing scores of various domains of quality of life between depressed and non depressed patients with diabetes using independent t test indicated significant lower mean scores in subscales of general health quality of life in general psychological health environment and overall score of quality of life in depressed diabetic patients at error level of 0.001 . linear regression model of prediction of quality of life score with independent variables of age gender duration of disease hypertension diabetes complications education marital status occupation physical activity and depression score showed significant and inverse relationship between overall score of quality of life and variables of physical activity diabetes complications or otherwise and depression score p 0.01 table 4 . the present study results are in line with the results in other studies and suggest high prevalence of depression among patients with diabetes 7 9 19 . according to the present study 58.2 of participants had moderate to severe depression and 15.5 had mild depression i.e. compared depressed patients and 8 groups of patients with chronic diseases and found that depressed patients showed greater reduction in the quality of life than the other 8 groups and this effect remained even after eliminating factors such as age gender and chronic diseases 35 . in the present study high prevalence of comorbidity of depression with diabetes in patients indicates that effect of depression comorbidity on the quality of life can significantly affect outcomes of the disease and early diagnosis of depression can improve quality of life 25 . given the results of this and other studies it seems that there is high prevalence of depression among patients with diabetes and it has a significant effect on diabetes outcomes and quality of life .", " the dx motif is composed of five nucleic acid strands one central long two times repetitive dna strand l2 two identical short peripheral dna strands s and two rna strands r . each dx tile only needs three unique component strands l r and s. strand r is an rna molecule and strands l and s are both dna molecules . the apparent height of the single layered two dimensional crystals was 2.1 nm a reasonable value for the diameter 2.5 nm of a form duplexes as rna the two dimensional crystals showed clear periodicities both along and perpendicular to their helical axes . overall the formation of tubules is preferred over two dimensional arrays in all cases and rna dna hybrid dx tiles are more prone than pure dna dx tiles to form tubular structures . symmetric dna star motifs are a family of related nanostructures that have different numbers of branches 3 4 5 and 6 . each motif is assembled from three different strands a long repetitive strand l a medium strand m and a short peripheral strand s . in the current work the m strand is replaced by an rna strand r resulting in rna dna hybrid star motifs . when appropriate sticky ends are present at the peripheral ends of the duplexes the hybrid motifs can further associate with each other into two dimensional arrays figs 2 and 3 . the l strands contain unpaired single stranded loops shown in orange in figs 2 and 3 three or four bases long for the three or four pointed star respectively at the centre . during slow cooling the rna dna hybrid star tiles readily assemble into two dimensional crystals which can be visualized by means of afm imaging . this observation suggests that the overall geometry of the individual rna dna hybrid tile is a skewed four point star or a four leafed pinwheel fig . a similar phenomenon although less obvious can be observed for the rna dna hybrid three point star motif fig . the strategy of dna programmed rna self assembly is not limited to two dimensional self assembly it can also be applied to three dimensional self assembly . the yield of the correctly formed particle is 40 based on visual observation of the cryoem images this is significantly lower than the assembly yield of pure dna dodecahedrons . from the experimentally observed particles a three dimensional map of the rna dna hybrid dodecahedron is generated by single particle three dimensional reconstruction a powerful technique routinely used by structural virologists35 . for two dimensional self assembly of star motifs of either homo dna or rna dna hybrid the symmetry remains the same three or fourfold rotational symmetry figs 2 and 3 . in the design of the star motifs each branch is an identical crossover structure and three or fourfold rotational symmetries are expected . in the previous homo dna structures the star motif exhibits near d3 or d4 symmetry . dna structures is likely due to the subtle difference between a and b form duplexes at the central region of the tile supplementary fig . single stranded loops 11 bases long the orange segments in strand l3 were used at the centre to provide enough flexibility for the motif to bend but a dodecahedron formed instead of a tetrahedron . dna hybrid star motifs are more rigid than their corresponding homo dna star motifs . to appreciate the level of challenge a four arm dna junction always adopts a right handed x shaped structure . three dimensional reconstructions of the dna dodecahedra used the single particle image processing software eman39 . three dimensional reconstructions of the dna dodecahedra used the single particle image processing software eman39 .", " consequently safer alternative anti inflammatory agents to prevent and treat excessive postoperative inflammation and pain following cataract surgery would be advantageous . in support of this several randomized prospective double masked and placebo controlled studies have shown that topically applied indomethacin 1 flurbiprofen 0.03 ketorolac 0.4 and 0.5 diclofenac 0.1 nepafenac 0.1 and bromfenac 0.09 reduce postoperative inflammation following cataract surgery.1 similarly prospective randomized studies have demonstrated that diclofenac 0.1 ketorolac 0.4 nepafenac 0.1 and bromfenac 0.09 reduce ocular discomfort after cataract surgery.1 of all the commercially available ophthalmic nsaids ketorolac tromethamine ketorolac possesses the greatest number of studies supporting its efficacy in preventing and treating postoperative inflammation and pain after cataract surgery table 1.521 ketorolac 0.5 acular allergan inc irvine ca is approved by the food and drug administration fda for seasonal allergic conjunctivitis inflammation following cataract surgery and ocular discomfort after refractive surgery.22 to reduce the incidence of burning and stinging a 0.4 concentration of ketorolac acular ls allergan inc was formulated and appears to have a similar therapeutic effect.1823 ketorolac 0.4 is approved by the fda for the reduction of ocular pain and burning following corneal refractive surgery . more recently a preservative free 0.45 preparation of ketorolac acuvail allergan inc in carboxymethylcellulose was approved by the fda in 2009 for the treatment of pain and inflammation following cataract surgery and is dosed twice daily.24 the specific intent of this review is to assess the available evidence supporting the efficacy of acuvail in the treatment of pain and inflammation after cataract surgery . however both the 0.4 and 0.5 solutions contain benzalkonium chloride a preservative the surfactant octoxynol40 and sodium edetate a metal chelating agent and are associated with a high incidence of burning and stinging on instillation as high as 40.222328 in an effort to increase ocular bioavailability a new formulation of ketorolac was developed to preserve the efficacy of prior formulations while enhancing tolerability with a less frequent dosing regimen.21 compared with the ketorolac 0.4 formulation the concentration of acuvail is 12 greater 0.45 and carboxymethylcellulose is added to the emulsion to allow greater drug retention on the ocular surface and improve comfort and drug penetration . this study concluded that acuvail delivered significantly higher concentrations of ketorolac to the aqueous humor and iris ciliary body . waterbury et al directly compared the peak and trough intraocular levels of acuvail bromfenac 0.9 xibrom ista pharmaceuticals inc irvine ca and placebo after three applications 35 l every 20 minutes in an animal model of lipopolysaccharide induced inflammation.30 peak concentrations in the aqueous humor and iris ciliary body were 738 ng ml and 556 ng g respectively for acuvail and 94 ng ml and 46 ng g respectively for bromfenac 0.9 . the study concluded that acuvail achieved aqueous and iris ciliary body concentrations that exceeded its inhibitory concentration of 50 ic50 values for cox1 and cox2 at both peak and trough table 2.1263132 in addition while both nsaids inhibited lipopolysaccharide induced aqueous prostaglandin e2 elevation only acuvail significantly prevented vascular leakage as measured by fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran leakage at trough levels . this reduced dosing regimen offers a distinct therapeutic advantage for acuvail because in addition to patient convenience several studies have suggested increased patient compliance with less frequent dosing.33 the efficacy of acuvail was assessed in two identical multicenter double masked randomized placebo controlled parallel studies and specifically conducted to evaluate the effects of acuvail on relief of pain and inflammation after cataract surgery.21 the results of these parallel studies were analyzed together and collectively involved 511 patients . although the combined results of these controlled studies demonstrate the efficacy of acuvail for the prevention and treatment of postoperative inflammation and pain after cataract surgery these results should be interpreted with caution . in addition because corticosteroids were not used concomitantly no information can be discerned about the additive benefits of acuvail with a corticosteroid in regards to inflammation and pain following cataract surgery . in a study comparing the efficacy of ketorolac 0.5 with prednisolone acetate 1 simone et al observed that prednisolone acetate was more effective at reducing intraocular inflammation by day 7 after cataract surgery than ketorolac although this difference resolved by day 28.10 several studies have demonstrated an additive benefit of a topical nsaid with a corticosteroid and their combined use therefore is common in clinical practice.1 therefore the results of this study can not be directly applied in the setting of concomitant corticosteroid use . nevertheless previous studies have demonstrated an additive benefit of ketorolac 0.5 or 0.4 when used in conjunction with corticosteroids in reducing inflammation pain and cme following cataract surgery . although ketorolac is approximately six times more potent as an inhibitor of cox1 than cox2 table 2 it is nevertheless a potent inhibitor of cox2 with an ic50 in the range of 0.090.12 m 33.945.2 ng ml.32 this allows ketorolac to inhibit cox2 in the iris ciliary body after topical application an important fact that can be overlooked if the relative cox1cox2 potencies of ocular nsaids are emphasized . although a large randomized prospective study demonstrated that ketorolac 0.5 was more effective than dexamethasone sodium phosphate 0.1 solution in facilitating re establishment of the blood aqueous barrier after surgery differences in drug formulation and intraocular concentration preclude any conclusions about synergy.3436 furthermore although many prospective studies have confirmed that the combination use of an nsaid and corticosteroid is superior to a corticosteroid alone for pain inflammation cme and visual improvement after intraocular surgery these findings can be explained by an additive effect of a second anti inflammatory agent.11737 the distinction between a synergistic effect and an additive effect has important implications because synergy implies that an nsaid used in combination with a corticosteroid provides a therapeutic effect that can not be replicated by simply increasing the dosing regimen of the corticosteroid . older formulations of ketorolac had an incidence of transient burning and stinging on instillation of approximately 2040 for the 0.4 concentration and 40 for the 0.5 concentration.2223 in contrast acuvail was associated with substantially lower rates 1.5 of burning and stinging.21 most importantly a significantly higher percentage of patients randomized to acuvail had a 3line or more improvement in vision from baseline compared with those treated with vehicle.21 at least two previously published studies using ketorolac 0.4 demonstrated a similar beneficial effect upon visual acuity following cataract and vitreoretinal surgery.1737 in patients undergoing routine vitreoretinal surgery patients randomized to ketorolac 0.4 experienced an average 4.3line improvement from baseline compared with a 2.5line improvement with placebo.37 this greater improvement in vision in the ketorolac group was observed despite concomitant corticosteroid use in both groups . given the favorable pharmacokinetics better tolerance and reduced dosing requirement of acuvail additional clinical studies comparing acuvail with other nsaids for the treatment of inflammation and pain after cataract surgery are indicated to confirm these promising results .", " over the past few decades researchers have proposed many different mechanisms for chloroquine action including 1 dna intercalation meshnick 1990 2 alteration of digestive food vacuole ph yayon et al . specifically we used the p. falciparum transcriptomic data obtained by hu and colleagues during the intraerythrocytic development cycle idc at different concentrations of chloroquine hu et al . our primary goal was to use these data to investigate the effect of chloroquine on p. falciparum dna replication . 1972 meshnick 1990 polet and barr 1968a polet and barr 1968b in bacteria ciak and hahn 1966 and in bioassays examining the effect of chloroquine on rna and dna polymerases cohen and yielding 1965 obrien et al . we validated the developed method by using a data set from an independent study that jointly capture transcriptomic and metabolomic data from p. falciparum to correctly predict the metabolic phenotype tied to genetic perturbation of two krebs cycle enzymes ke et al . we then focused on the inhibition of dna replication in p. falciparum as a consequence of chloroquine treatment a critical metabolic phenotype ciak and hahn 1966 cohen and yielding 1965 polet and barr 1968a and used our method to simulate the effect of chloroquine on the metabolic fluxes of p. falciparum during the idc . we identified genes that were substantially altered in response to chloroquine treatment and linked to the inhibition of p. falciparum dna replication . 2010 to simulate the effect of chloroquine on the time dependent metabolic fluxes of pf3d7 and pfdd2 during the idc . we modified the factor rit to iritminiritmeanritminirit where i denotes the median relative change in the reaction expression of the ith reaction following chloroquine treatment as observed in previous experiments hu et al . 2010 also show that metabolic genes critical for p. falciparum dna synthesis are suppressed by chloroquine treatment . we sought to identify the genes that are substantially altered in response to chloroquine and cause inhibition of p. falciparum dna synthesis . this suggests that many combinations of such genes may underlie the metabolic response associated with chloroquine treatment . 1990 we aimed at identifying the minimal number of genes hereinafter referred to as the core genes that are sufficient to completely account for the effect of chloroquine on dna synthesis by the parasite . we identified the core genes based on the bayesian information criteria bic score schwarz 1978 which is given by nlnssenklnn where ssei1nvictlvicqn2maxvctlminvctl and n denotes the number of time points k the number of genes being tested vctl the estimated rate of dna synthesis under control conditions and vcqn the estimated rate of dna synthesis after chloroquine treatment with 1 for the k genes being tested . 2a shows the biochemical pathways incorporated into the computer model used to predict the functional consequences of altered fluxes of tca cycle enzymes in response to previously studied genetic perturbations ke et al . in agreement with previous experimental observations cohen and yielding 1965 polet and barr 1968a our simulations suggested that chloroquine treatment results in dose dependent inhibition of dna replication fig . in our simulations however a similar concentration of chloroquine resulted in greater dna synthesis inhibition in pfdd2 fig . notably the transcriptional profile for pfdd2 was more down regulated than that for pf3d7 at a similar concentration of chloroquine . we found that 81 metabolic reactions in our network model are critical for p. falciparum dna synthesis . 3 indicate that chloroquine treatment inhibits replication of p. falciparum dna which in turn suggests that pathways essential for dna synthesis are inhibited . 4 shows the relative change in the amount of dna synthesized by the parasite during the idc period in response to chloroquine treatment . preventing only the core genes from being down regulated by chloroquine was sufficient to restore the amount of dna synthesized to control values fig . 4 green markers for these simulations the reaction expressions of the core genes were set to be equal for control and chloroquine treated conditions . a list of the core genes identified for each strain and chloroquine dose table s3 suggests that thioredoxin reductase and ribonucleotide reductase substantially affect the amount of synthesized dna . we simulated the effect of chloroquine on the metabolic flux profiles of p. falciparum during the idc . 1998 some experiments suggest inhibition of dna replication as a potential mechanism of chloroquine action cohen and yielding 1965 kwakye berko and meshnick 1989 polet and barr 1968a . we developed a method that successfully predicted a reduction in the ability of the parasite to synthesize dna in response to chloroquine treatment see fig . we identified twelve distinct genes that were substantially affected in pf3d7 and pfdd2 after chloroquine treatment importantly preventing their down regulation in response to chloroquine treatment was sufficient for restoring the p. falciparum dna synthesis inhibited by chloroquine treatment see table 1 . a closer look at these genes reveals a potential mechanism of chloroquine action that unifies previous theories and observations involving heme fitch 1998 dna replication polet and barr 1968a and oxidative stress lehane et al . here we focused on candidates susceptible to a low dose of chloroquine because several pathways will be inhibited at higher concentrations see table s3 chloroquine 144 nm . the hypothesis that chloroquine kills the malarial parasite by dna intercalation is decades old meshnick 1990 . our model analyses do not identify a drug target or targets however they suggest that the effect of chloroquine administration leads to inhibition of dna synthesis . according to our model the parasite responds to chloroquine by reducing the expression of genes critical for dna synthesis . although chloroquine could specifically intercalate with the identified core gene set in accord with the dna intercalation theory of chloroquine meshnick 1990 obrien et al . knowledge of this mechanism allowed us to identify metabolic pathways that could be exploited to increase chloroquine efficacy . our aim was to identify and investigate enzymes that contribute to decreased dna replication in response to chloroquine treatment . using a transcriptomics based approach we can identify cellular responses that are specific to chloroquine by expression data taken from chloroquine treated parasites . the effect of chloroquine on dna replication is likely to be indirect being mediated by heme accumulation which evokes multiple toxic effects in the cell . we simulated the effect of chloroquine over the entire idc based on the available transcriptome data taken from an eight hour window during the trophozoite stage . in the case presented here the largest effect of chloroquine occurs during the trophozoite stage and the protocol for collecting experimental transcriptomic data was designed to characterize transcriptional changes during this stage . herein we investigated the potential mechanism by which chloroquine inhibits dna synthesis in p. falciparum and kills the parasite . we then developed an algorithm employing bayesian information theory to identify potential pathways that inhibit dna synthesis in response to chloroquine treatment . our analysis suggests that 1 chloroquine inhibits dna synthesis via inhibition of redox metabolism carbon fixation and anaplerotic tca cycle metabolism 2 p. falciparum may maintain dna synthesis after chloroquine treatment by preserving a reduced pool of thioredoxin and by invoking alternate mechanisms for synthesizing phosphoenolpyruvate and 3 a drug or combination of drugs that target redox metabolism carbon fixation and heme accumulation could be an effective way to target the parasite . the method developed here used limited transcriptome data to identify pathways that underlie the inhibition of dna synthesis of p. falciparum in response to chloroquine treatment . this suggests that the developed method could also be suitable to simulate and capture the effect of other drugs or stress conditions on complex metabolic and physiological responses of p. falciparum based solely on transcriptome data .", " the aim here is to compare the psychometric properties of the opqol with the casp19 and whoqol old among

reports of obligatory myiasis the majority of reported cases are facultative myiasis and more than a dozen families of flies can cause this form gullan and durden 2009 . the scuttle flies which are important agent of human facultative myiasis exhibit a greater diversity of larval habitat than other insects . 2007 previous studies showed them as a cause of human myiasis francesconi lupi 2012 . so the study of men clinical manifestation as well as morphology of third instars larvae of these flies seems to be important . the larvae were forwarded to the department of medical entomology and vector control for further studies . urogenital myiasis the infestation of genitourinary organs by maggots based on the anatomical location could be classified as external or internal myiasis . all described cases are considered as accidental cases and uncommon myiasis agents are associated with m. scalaris psychoda albipenis and muscoid flies francesconi and lupi 2012 . the first report of human urogenital myiasis due to this species was reported in 1978 by disney and kurahashi and then other cases were reported ramalingam et al . the passing of live m. scalaris larvae in the urine indicated infestation of the urogenital system . it is worth mentioning that identification of the immature larvae of parasite causing myiasis posed difficulties particularly the parasite with little available knowledge . the rational treatment of genitourinary myiasis is to remove the offending larvae . medical personnel should take care of susceptible patients especially those with nocturnal enuresis need to bear in mind the possibility of infestation with scuttle flies larvae be able to make a prompt diagnosis of myiasis and implement relevant intervention to prevent tissue infestation . since m. scalaris can possess considerable larval habitat its creation of various clinical forms of myiasis is imminent .", " as far as we know until now the genetic variation of pldh gene in p. vivax

as all or nothing diagnostic categories considerable heterogeneity within categories extensive overlap or comorbidity among categories indistinct boundaries with normal personality and incomplete coverage of personality psychopathology led to the revision of the dsm approach 1 2 . moreover the dsm5 personality disorders work group has proposed impairments in personality functioning as the central element of pd 11 . the review of literature showed that levels of personality functioning or self other approach for diagnosis are informative in determining both the type and the severity of personality pathology 12 14 . the severity of impairment in personality functioning has also been shown to be important in planning treatment and predicting its outcome . despite the good advantages and empirical background of levels of personality functioning practical studies in clinical settings with specific pds and cross cultural studies in this field also researchers need to determine which levels of personality functioning better predict and explain severity than others . the purpose of the current study was firstly to examine the relationship between dsm5 levels of personality functioning on an iranian sample with antisocial and borderline personality disorders and second to explore which levels of personality functioning in patients with antisocial and borderline personality disorders can better predict severity . data gathering measurements included psychological reports scid ii pq scid ii and dsm5 levels of personality functioning checklist . the dsm5 levels of personality functioning include identity self direction empathy and intimacy . inter rater reliability for semi structured interview of dsm5 levels of personality functioning items was above 0.80 . the dsm5 levels of personality functioning scale domains correlation with dsm iv was between 0.30 and 0.69 . as mentioned above there were two groups of patients patients with personality disorders and normal subjects . we computed bivariate correlations between the dsm5 levels of personality functioning and aspd and bpd symptoms . to examine which levels of personality functioning in patients with antisocial and borderline personality disorders can better predicted severity stepwise regression analysis was used in which scid ii results aspd and bpd severity were the dependent variables and levels of personality functioning were the predictors . data gathering measurements included psychological reports scid ii pq scid ii and dsm5 levels of personality functioning checklist . the dsm5 levels of personality functioning include identity self direction empathy and intimacy . inter rater reliability for semi structured interview of dsm5 levels of personality functioning items was above

levels of personality functioning and aspd and bpd symptoms . to examine the relationship between dsm5 levels of personality functioning and aspd and bpd severity a stepwise regression analysis was conducted where aspd and bpd severity were the dependent variables and levels of personality functioning identity self directedness intimacy empathy were the independent variables . the results of regression analysis for levels of personality functioning and aspd severity are presented in table 4 . the results of regression analysis for levels of personality functioning and bpd severity are displayed in table 5 . the first aim of this study was to examine the dsm5 levels of personality functioning on an iranian sample with antisocial and borderline personality disorders . this means that dsm5 levels of personality functioning had a good relationship with antisocial personality disorder symptoms of an iranian sample . therefore the second aim of this study was to explore which levels of personality functioning in patients with antisocial and borderline personality disorders can better predict severity . in addition the results showed that the dsm5 levels of personality functioning are an essential part of antisocial and borderline personality disorders . the present study is one of the first in which researchers examined the dsm5 levels of personality functioning relationship with severity and is the first study on iranian patients with personality disorders based on the dsm5 approach . overall our findings showed that the levels of personality functioning are a significant predictor of antisocial and borderline personality disorders severity . seventh and finally our work focused on the assessment of dsm5 levels of personality functioning and severity in adults .", " two ultimate and complementary goals are reached i control of the inflow and outflow of metabolic precursors and products ii prevention of entry to the brain of undesired compounds.fig .

controversies about the bbb status as assessed with different compounds have lasted until the present time with bbb changes being either confirmed wang et al . 1991 showed that ammonia enters the brain more easily in advanced he patients than in healthy controls . a plausible explanation for the ammonia induced increase of blood brain aaa transport activity was proposed by james and colleagues 1979 who hypothesized that during hyperammonemia increased brain glutamine gln production is followed by increased gln efflux from the brain resulting in increased inward transport of these amino acids . 1985 showed that treatment of pca rats with an inhibitor of gln synthesis methionine sulfoximine mso reduced the increased accumulation of the aaa in the brain in a manner correlated with increased ammonia accumulation . these effects appeared to be due to ammonia induced functional impairment of lnaa transport at the bbb . in rats in which ha was executed by urease administration the impairment was found closely correlated with the rise in brain gln content bachmann and colombo 1983 while in the cortical capillaries the increased try gln exchange could be related to the raised glutamyl transpeptidase ggt activity stastn et al . because ggt participates in lnaa transport and its activity was found to be increased in brain capillaries from hyperammonemic rats a hypothesis has been put forward that ggt is involved in triggering the outward transport of the excess of gln from brain gorgievski hrisoho et al . 1984 showed a 30 increase in the brain uptake of arg in the galactosamine model of hepatic failure however the effect was not specific to this amino acid and possibly secondary to bbb leakage also revealed by high molecular weight markers . by contrast arg

blood was found in the taa model of he albrecht and hilgier 1986 albrecht et al . increased bbb transport of orn in the taa model has been considered as auto protective response and in the same line has been speculated to facilitate intracerebral therapeutic action of the ammonia trapping drug l ornithine l aspartate lola albrecht et al . the effects of he on arg transport are also likely to be mediated by gln which accumulates intracerebrally in consequence of increased ammonia influx cooper and plum 1987 overloading different cellular and subcellular compartments of the cns albrecht 2010 . it has been shown that gln added exogenously reduces no generation in the brain by inhibiting arg transport via the arg gln exchanger ylat2 and that this effect is potentiated when ammonia is infused directly to the brain hilgier et al . if the above mechanism operates not only in the cns cells but also in the cerebral capillary endothelial cells forming the bbb enhanced gln accumulation would modulate arg transport in these cells . consistent with the role of arg gln exchange at the bbb our preliminary data indicate that ammonia increases the expression of the ylat2 transporter in a cerebral capillary endothelial cell line manuscript in preparation as it does in the brain in the course of ha in situ zieliska et al . further studies on the mechanisms and pathophysiological implications of the changes in arg or orn influx to the brain are warranted in view of the proven or suspected contributions of the amino acids to the pathogenesis of he . arg is a precursor of no a

synthesis has been implicated in impairment of cognition associated with prolonged hyperammonemia felipo 2006 . evaluation of the contribution of changes in arg transport across the bbb to the

autoimmune dysregulation due to a sequestered antigen induced by skin infection and pruritus after burn injury may have an important role in the pathogenesis of igan . nephritis is a rare complication of burn injury and once this happens it will affect the recovery and prognosis of the patient . regular urine analysis will contribute to the early detection and diagnosis of glomerular diseases while treating burn injury . once persistent hypoalbuminemia exist the burned patients need further examination to diagnose whether they have chronic glomerulonephritis or nephrotic syndrome . if the burned patient has nephrotic syndrome enough glucocorticoid should be administered in order to alleviate proteinuria effectively and for the recovery of burn wounds .", " ventricular contraction and recovery are recorded as qt interval in ecg hence qtd represents the regional heterogeneity of ventricular repolarization duration in the 3dimensional structure of ventricular myocardium 1012 . the change in autonomic tone in these patients may also be related to ventricular arrhythmias . the aim of this study was to assess short term changes in qtd and hrv parameters after successful pci of cto patients . the qt intervals and qtd were measured manually from the standard ecgs available before and after pci . all ecgs were scanned at a 600 dpi resolution and computer based analysis was performed by 2 independent cardiologists who were blind to the timing of the ecgs and patients data . to measure qtd qt interval was defined as the interval between beginnings of qrs complex to the point the t wave returned to isoelectric line and for each lead the mean of qt interval in 4 consecutive beats was measured . dispersion of the qt interval was measured as the difference between the maximum and minimum mean qt intervals recorded in any of the 12 leads of the standard ecg . after completing the computer based measurements qtd was tested to identify intra observer variability in 25 randomly selected patients using the bland altman method . the qt intervals and qtd were measured manually from the standard ecgs available before and after pci . all ecgs were scanned at a 600 dpi resolution and computer based analysis was performed by 2 independent cardiologists who were blind to the timing of the ecgs and patients data . dispersion of the qt interval was measured as the difference between the maximum and minimum mean qt intervals recorded in any of the 12 leads of the standard ecg . after completing the computer based measurements qtd was tested to identify intra observer variability in 25 randomly selected patients using the bland altman method . we investigated changes in qtcd and hrv parameters in cto patients undergoing successful percutaneous revascularization . the major findings of this study are 1 successful revascularization may improve qtcd in patients with cto 2 the revascularization in cto lesions does not seem to have a significant impact on hrv and 3 the impact on hrv does not change with the intervention to the lad cx or rca . a direct relationship between the prolongation of the qt interval and myocardial ischemia has been reported by roukema et al . in experimental animal studies and in human studies it has been shown that the qt interval shortened in acutely hypoperfused areas whereas in infarcted myocardium there was a prolonged repolarization time associated with qt prolongation on the ecg . reported that increased qtd is related to susceptibility to reentry ventricular tachyarrhythmias independent of degree of lv dysfunction or clinical characteristics of the patient suggesting that the simple noninvasive measurement of this interval from a standard 12lead ecg significantly contributes to identifying patients at risk for life threatening arrhythmias after a previous mi . the strong heart study of assessment of qt interval and qtd for prediction of all cause cardiovascular cv mortality showed that qtcd was a strong predictor of all cause mortality and a weaker predictor of cv mortality and that qtd is a significant predictor of cv mortality . in our study although there was a trend in decrease in some hrv parameters following pci of cto none of the parameters reached statistical significance .", " ocular cicatricial pemphigoid ocp is an uncommon chronic autoimmune disease that affects mucous membranes particularly the conjunctiva.1 the disease typically results in chronic conjunctivitis and causes conjunctival and corneal scarring which can result in limbal stem cell deficiency and blindness.2 adequate control of ocular inflammation usually requires systemic as well as topical immunosuppressants . he had been treated with tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic ointment in both eyes as needed and doxycycline 100 mg by mouth daily with no improvement in his symptoms . the patient demonstrated gradual improvement in the conjunctival inflammation after starting the methotrexate and prednisone . the patient s conjunctival inflammation appeared stable following initiation of the phlebotomy treatments and the mmf was subsequently discontinued . since initiation of the phlebotomy treatments the patient s conjunctival inflammation and subconjunctival fibrosis has remained quiescent for 4 months without requiring mmf figure 3 . in the present case the patient s conjunctival inflammation was observed to significantly improve following initiation of treatment for his porphyria .", " thus the need for lymph node assessment during surgery is the most challenging issue among gynecologists . as gynecologic oncology surgeons have gained more experience and skill in different techniques and procedures and more interest in minimally invasive surgery the laparoscopic approach has found applications in the treatment of endometrial cancer . laparoscopy has a similar success rate when compared with laparotomic staging and it can be accepted as less invasive . studies have shown that the lymph node yield from laparoscopy is equivalent to that of laparotomy . although laparoscopic pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy is accepted as feasible randomized studies are still awaited to standardize its indications and applications . one group comprised 26 patients managed by traditional laparotomic surgery while the other comprised 26 patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery . two 7.7 patients in the laparoscopy group and 4 15.4 in the laparotomy group had pelvic lymph node metastasis . study groups compared according to stage histologic grades of the study groups histologic types of endometrial cancer in the study groups the laparoscopic group had significantly shorter hospitalization than did the laparotomy group 4.1 vs 8.2 days z 1.96 p0.05 . operative time of laparoscopy being close to that of laparotomy was encouraging 155 vs 144 minutes p0.05 . nowadays the laparoscope allows us to carry out almost any procedure that can be done by laparotomy in gynecologic practice . however in the management of gynecologic cancers the laparoscope had a lesser role until pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissections became feasible in the 1990s . scribner et al compared laparoscopy and laparotomy in a similar number of patients as in our study . thirty seven patients were treated in the laparoscopic group versus 33 patients in the laparotomy group . blood loss and yield of pelvic and paraaortic lymph nodes duration of surgery and incidence of postoperative complications were similar for both groups . while comparing laparotomy and laparoscopy the number of residual nodes following lymphadenectomy has also been studied because lymph nodes left in situ might have had microscopic metastases . in a review by lecuru and taurelle laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy was declared able to retrieve 90 to 95 of the nodes which was similar to that of laparotomy . increasing numbers of advanced laparoscopic applications like expanded lymph node dissections and more radicalness in treating gynecologic cancers have caused surgeons to face other complications as well . in our study group almost 90 of the patients in the laparoscopy group had stage i or ii disease following surgical staging whereas only 70 of the patients in the laparotomy group had early stage disease .", "", " the magnitude of admixture linkage disequilibrium ald in an admixed population depends on the allele frequency differential between the parental populations the level of admixture the admixture dynamics the time since admixture and the recombination rate between the loci . thus if the parental populations differ in a trait or disease due to different frequencies of risk alleles it should be possible to identify the loci containing these alleles using admixture mapping am 12 14 . at some other loci however there had been some change in allele frequency in the time since the separation of parental populations and it is at these loci where admixture has had an important effect . understanding the genetic consequences of admixture is important because it can be both a confounding factor and a source of statistical power in gene identification studies . for both models association between markers simulation studies have shown that populations that have a demographic history more consistent with the cgf model of admixture retain ald over larger chromosomal regions and show significant associations between unlinked marker loci . 2001 there are several ways in which admixture can be an important resource in the elucidation of genetic factors that contribute to the risk of common disease . decomposing the sources of variation it is possible to distinguish between the genetic and environmental explanations for ethnic differences in disease risk and investigating the mode of inheritance by studying the relationship of disease risk to individual admixture 1417 19 . estimates of biogeographical ancestry bga the proportional ancestry levels of an individual can be used in conjunction with measured environmental effects for investigating the roles of environmental and inherited risks underlying complex traits 18 20 . diseases with possible genetic components based on ethnic differences in disease rates and hence amenable to admixture mapping admixture based methods rely on using suitable markers and estimates of allele frequencies from appropriately identified parental populations . this report followed from earlier work where markers with large allele frequency difference were identified to be appropriate for admixture studies and most 95 per cent of the arbitrarily identified biallelic markers had 50 per cent . suggested referring to markers suitable for admixture studies as ancestry informative markers aims given that the central feature of these markers is the ancestry information content f . various statistical approaches have been used to estimate admixture proportions in these populations and have been reviewed in detail elsewhere . traits and diseases more prevalent in one population than in others are amenable to admixture analysis and some examples are listed in table 1 . earlier studies focused on admixed populations as units of analysis in exploring relationships between ancestry and phenotypes . another related approach is to test for individual admixture phenotype correlations within an admixed population . correlations between ancestry and phenotypes have been detected and reported by various authors 1417 19444547 . a prerequisite for testing ancestry phenotype correlations is the presence of stratification related to admixture which will be evident in variation in individual ancestry levels . following the argument of chakraborty and weiss admixture proportions should be correlated with diseases traits that differ in populations due to underlying genetic differences . it is important to keep in mind that ancestry pheno type correlations are dependent on both the existence of functional alleles at different frequencies in parental populations and significant stratification related to admixture . although most admixed populations tested to date are structured there is variation in the amount of stratification present and this structure should be tested for explicitly when investigating a new population . other approaches proposed for using admixture include a method based on the transmission disequilibrium test tdt that assesses excess transmission of alleles derived from high risk ancestors to affected offspring of parents who are heterozygous at the marker locus containing one allele from each of two ancestral populations . when allelic ancestry at marker loci is known this approach is analogous to a linkage analysis hence the term am is more appropriate than mald for describing this method and to distinguish it from ld approaches . controlling for parental admixture eliminates association of the trait with ancestry at unlinked loci . by removing the background effects of ancestry it is possible to observe the locus specific effects on a trait disease . allelic ancestry at a locus is inferred from the marker by using the conditional probability of each allelic state given the ancestry specific allele frequencies . offer an advantage over classical maximum likelihood based methods

reaction catalysed by acot enzymes is very important during fatty acid metabolism . ten human acot genes have been identified to date compared with 13 in mice and 12 in rats . type ii acots make up the second group these enzymes are members of the hot dog fold enzyme superfamily which includes a wide variety of functionally diverse proteins . the revised nomenclature for human mouse and rat acyl coa thioesterase genes was established by hunt et al . in recent years a number of human acots have been recombinantly expressed and enzymatically characterised although the exact physiological function and importance of many of these enzymes remain unknown . to date a total of ten genes have been identified within the human genome all of which exhibit acyl coa thioesterase activity table 1

a high degree of sequence homology table 2 . amino acid sequence identity between type i and type ii human acyl coa thioesterases acots . homology was considered not significant and left blank if the observed identity was less than 15 per cent abbreviations baat bile acid coa amino acid n acyltransferase them thioesterase superfamily member a similar situation is observed within the mouse and rat orthologues acot1 acot2 acot3 acot4 acot5 and acot6 which are clustered on chromosomes 12 d3 and 6q31 respectively . in the mouse the acot3 acot4 and acot5 enzymes each exhibit specific expression patterns and enzyme substrate specificity . the lack of a human orthologue to mouse acot3 and acot5 was suggested to be the result of convergent evolution it was hypothesised that convergent functional evolution led to a reduced need for multiple enzymes in humans . this finding suggests that acot4 was an ancestral gene encoding an acot4 enzyme with broad substrate recognition and that gene duplication events led to acot1 or 2 and that further duplication events led to the mouse acot3 and acot5 genes encoding the acot3 and acot5 enzymes which have similar substrate specificity to that of mouse acot4 and human acot4 . the n terminal region of both acots is unrelated to any of the other start containing enzymes suggesting that these proteins may be the result of a gene fusion event between an acyl thioesterase and start domain containing sequences . type i and type ii acyl coa thioesterases represent two structurally distinct enzyme groups . acot1 acot2 and acot4 contain an n terminal acyl coa thioester hydrolase domain pfam 04775 . acot1 is cytosolic and primarily responsible for the metabolism of long chain acyl coas . as previously mentioned acot6 lacks the n terminal acyl coa thioester hydrolase domain . acot13 previously called thioesterase superfamily member 2 them2 differs from the other type ii acots in that it contains a single hot dog domain . were recently determined using recombinant protein results indicate that acot13 prefers medium to long chain acyl coa thioesters . this finding suggests that the start domains identified in acot11 and acot12 could have a similar effect on enzyme activity . as such we recommend that the enzyme be renamed acot14 according to the accepted nomenclature established by hunt et al . the human acyl coa gene family represents a diverse group of enzymes that catalyse the hydrolysis of acyl coa thioesters to their corresponding free fatty acids and coenzyme a. these enzymes are involved in a number of cellular processes but are primarily thought to play an important role in lipid metabolism . despite catalysing the same enzymatic reaction the acyl coa thioesterase family members can be divided into two distinct groups type i and type ii . them4 was identified as having acyl coa thioesterase activity and should be considered as a new family member .", " after approximately 40 generations in

factor present in all pd patients and generates an inflammatory state causing stress on the peritoneum due to the formation of carbonyl products . several pd solutions are available on the market today and all are to varying degrees associated with peritoneal inflammation . its bioincompatibility with the peritoneal membrane is well known as well as its capacity to stimulate the production of fibroblast growth factors contributing to peritoneal fibrosis . chronic exposure to high glucose load in traditional pd solution induces significant inflammation of the peritoneal membrane . the endothelial system is another known factor with potent profibrotic characteristics and plays a role in the development of peritoneal fibrosis . this system can be activated by two receptors endothelial receptors a and b. however endothelial receptor b apparently does not play a role in peritoneal membrane thickening in experimental studies inducing deficiency of endothelial receptor b. finally and of extreme importance infectious peritonitis is an obvious cause of peritoneal inflammation and is associated with eps development . histological alterations of the peritoneal membrane observed in eps cases are nonspecific and are masked by the alterations commonly observed in patients with ultrafiltration failure and infectious peritonitis over the long term . pd initiation increases inflammatory stimuli for the chronic kidney patient such as the presence of the peritoneal catheter use of bioincompatible solutions and possible infectious peritonitis . an understanding of the mechanisms involved in peritoneal inflammation is fundamental for the development of new strategies .", " it has been claimed that the m30 assay has both predictive value of drug response 24 and

and a radicular vein leading to impaired venous drainage from the spinal cord and the arterialization of the vein due to increased venous pressure . sensory exam showed generalized sensation loss involving both dorsal columns and the spinothalamic tract and subjective pins and needles sensations in both feet and the right arm . given the association of both lower and upper limb involvement and hyperreflexia a cervical lesion was suspected . the patient developed quadriplegia with severe generalized weakness and sensation loss in both legs and both arms inspiratory muscle weakness dysphonia and high urinary retention . sdavf may present with a wide range of clinical features such as motor and sensory deficits often associated with a cauda equina syndrome . neurological deficits are due to perimedullary venous congestion leading to intramedullary edema or ischemia in severe cases or direct compression of the nerve roots at the level of the fistula . this can compromise the already fragile venous return into the dural sac leading to medullary hypoxia and further worsening the sdavf symptoms . therefore a rapid rise in venous return from the upper extremities into the brachiocephalic vein could also directly diminish the venous return from the medullary level and exacerbate symptoms . acute neurological worsening after intravenous steroid administration for any presumed diagnosis should be considered such a red flag and raise the suspicion of an sdavf .", " several epidemiological studies have reported an association between proteinuria and a poor prognosis in hypertensive patients . the burden of proteinuria and its association with hypertension have not been studied in the adult hypertensive population of afghanistan . therefore this study was aimed at determining the prevalence of proteinuria and the association of different variables with proteinuria among adult hypertensive patients attending an outpatient clinic in afghanistan . the prevalence of proteinuria was 67.2 and considerably higher in male than in female patients p 0.001 . fequency distribution of sociodemographic characteristics of study participants n555 the mean age of patients in the proteinuria and non proteinuria groups was 62.0 13.6 years and 57.7 13.4 years respectively . patients with proteinuria had substantially increased levels of both systolic bp and diastolic bp 155.0 24.8 vs.146.2 24.0 mm hg and 94.6 13.8 vs. 88.6 10.8 mm hg p 0.001 respectively . the prevalence of proteinuria was significantly higher among diabetic patients than non diabetic patients 14.7 vs. 3.8 p 0.001 . comparison of factors associated with proteinuria among hypertensive patients multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association between proteinuria and smoking heart failure myocardial infarction diabetes mellitus stroke hypercholesterolemia and regular physical activity . patients with heart failure had a more than two fold increase in the odds of proteinuria than those without heart failure 95ci 1.134.45 . patients aged 65 years showed a 1.02 times increase of in the odds of proteinuria than those 65 years 95ci 1.001.04 . myocardial infarction regular physical activity and diabetes mellitus were other variables that had a significant association with proteinuria in the univariate logistic regression model however in the multivariate model this association was not significant table 3 . there has been a lack of data about the prevalence of proteinuria in afghanistan which is important information on the evaluation of hypertensive patients . the presence of proteinuria helps in identifying patients who are at high risk and need to receive aggressive treatment for risk factors . the prevalence of proteinuria among patients with hypertension in the northern part of afghanistan was 67.2 . however in our study the prevalence of proteinuria was higher than that seen in another study from a tertiary hospital in uganda 39.5 . diabetes mellitus renal disease dyslipidemia and obesity as well as the technique used for proteinuria determination . in our study we found a significant association between proteinuria and the male which is comparable with the results of others studies . who found that an increase in systolic bp and diastolic bp was related to a prevalence of proteinuria however al saffar et al . according to our study there was a substantial statistically difference between proteinuria and patient age which is in agreement with other studies . therefore the early detection of proteinuria and screening of hypertensive patients might prevent complication such as renal and cardiovascular diseases . the present study has shown an independent relationship between proteinuria and the presence of concomitant diseases such as diabetes congestive heart failure and myocardial infarction . furthermore the finding that the prevalence of proteinuria was higher among patients with diabetes is most likely attributable to the fact that these patients had diabetes nephropathy . we conclude that our results confirm the presence of a high incidence of proteinuria among hypertensive outpatients in a clinic in andkhoy afghanistan especially in those with a high cardiovascular risk . therefore more frequent screening for proteinuria might be imperative for the evaluation this project was supported in part by the non profit organization epidemiological and clinical research information network ecrin .", " in this short review we summarize briefly the role of the eosinophils in the general context of immunoregulation and its relation with oral squamous cell carcinoma . the initial recruitment and activation of eosinophils towards the tumour microenvironment is principally related with th2 response although necrotic cells can stimulate both the migration and the activation of eosinophils 10 11 . according to the literature th2 response may eliminate the cancer on the dependence of eosinophils and macrophages 8 1214 . upon stimulation with ifn il3 and gm csf human eosinophilc cell line differentiated with dibutyryl cyclic amp deol1 and human peripheral blood pb eosinophils were able to respond to the lymphoid chemokines e.g. therefore eosinophils can migrate to the lymphoid chemokine microenvironment and express antigen presenting cells apcs related costimulatory molecules . contrarily eosinophils are capable to downregulate the antitumour immunity through mainly il10 and ido production . regarding studies with eosinophils in the blood the presence of eosinophils and th2 cells can be related with tumour progression and poor prognosis 43 44 . in the head and neck region some studies have shown that the tate has a favourable prognosis suggesting that eosinophils may play a protective role against epithelial tumours 6 55 60 62 . other studies however suggest that eosinophils may play a role in promoting epithelial tumour growth accounting for a poor prognosis 7 57 58 or even no effect on tumour evolution 54 56 59 63 . similar results were observed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and oral ssc where the eosinophils were not associated with local recurrence distant metastases or survival . according to oliveira and colleagues and cormier and colleagues the presence of eosinophis in damaged striated muscular fibers of oral cancer or in capsule of b16f10 melanoma cell derived tumours respectively could be related with tissue remodelling . according to falconieri and colleagues and oliveira and colleagues the eosinophil presence in the scc of the oral cavity similar results have been observed in head and neck carcinoma 57 58 and cervix where eosinophils infiltrate has increased the suspicion of invasion .", " to avoid confounding of the association

total cholesterol levels supplementary tables 1 and 2 . we separately assessed the association of fasting serum glucose for risk of various cvd outcomes in men and women finding similar patterns of association by sex for fatal and nonfatal events combined tables 1 and 2 . the risks for the various cvd outcomes were lowest in both sexes for those with serum glucose in the range of 70109 mg dl and increased above and below this range . fasting glucose levels 70 mg dl were associated with slightly increased risk of atherosclerotic cvd in men hazard ratio hr 1.04 95 ci 1.011.08 and in women hr 1.06 1.021.10 . fasting glucose levels 70 mg dl were associated with increased risk of all stroke in men hr 1.06 1.011.11 in women hr 1.11 1.051.17 . fasting serum glucose levels at enrollment and risk of cardiovascular diseases in male participants of the korean cancer prevention study 19932010 fasting serum glucose levels at enrollment and risk of cardiovascular diseases in female participants of the korean cancer prevention study 19932010 for cardiac outcomes and thrombotic stroke the general patterns of association were quite comparable . for participants having a glucose level in the range of 110125 mg dl the hr was increased by 1020 and those in the highest category experienced a doubling or more of the risk of having a cvd event . in a large cohort of korean men and women we found that fasting glucose level was associated with higher risk for major cvd outcomes increasing from a level of 90 mg dl after controlling for other risk factors . in addition the effects of other cvd risk factors may be enhanced by abnormal glucose metabolism 2325 . as a consequence our findings support lowering the current american diabetes association ifg cut off of 100 mg dl and they also open the possibility that low fasting glucose levels may identify people at increased risk for cvd . low fasting glucose levels in the nondiabetic population were associated with increased mortality in several studies 515 . in our study the lowest risk for cvd mortality occurred in the interval of 8599 mg dl with a nadir at 90 mg dl suggesting that the range of fasting glucose levels associated with the lowest risk for cvd is narrow . in a prospective cohort study of 40000 people the lowest total mortality was associated with fasting plasma glucose of 79109 mg dl 15 . fasting blood glucose level 100 mg dl was not associated with coronary heart disease death 35 . the basis of the association between low fasting glucose levels and risk for cvd in people without diabetes is unclear . 15 hypothesized that long term exposure to low fasting plasma glucose may serve as a risk factor for cvd mortality perhaps through abnormal cardiac activity and thrombosis particularly in patients with atherosclerosis . in a pooled analysis of data from 97 cohorts involving people without vascular disease on enrollment an increase in risk for vascular disease death was observed in those with blood glucose level 70 mg dl on enrollment 7 . because cvd risk factors and development of cvd are usually associated with metabolic abnormalities that increase fasting plasma glucose additional studies need to be conducted to understand if low fasting plasma glucose levels are a consequence of impending disease i.e.", " i heard from members of the influenza research community and reviewed the world health organization who data indicating that this avian virus had a very high mortality rate in humans . the thought of combining the high human mortality of influenza a h5n1 with a highly transmissible human adapted phenotype was sobering . i carefully considered how restricting the information would compromise scientific research progress and even how it would hinder public health efforts to prevent such a horrific pandemic . with this firm conclusion in hand policy makers granting agencies public health officials and vaccine and drug developers should have both the motivation and a compelling argument to move forward to improve our influenza fighting infrastructure . this comes not only from my own professional experience in globally tracking dangerous pathogens but also from personally watching the 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic spread globally . publishing a detailed experimental protocol on how to produce a highly transmissible h5n1 virus in a highly regarded scientific journal is a very bad idea . why should the nsabb be telling the world what to do why has not the world already had these discussions and debates how could the nsabb stimulate the process such that global leaders in science policy and public health engage in a broad based conversation on these issues the specific nsabb recommendations seem to have been accepted and are being implemented by two research groups and two scientific journals more importantly the research issue of adapting an avian virus to mammals potentially humans is a topic that is being widely discussed .", " asthma is the most common chronic disease in children7 and the prevalence of asthma is increasing worldwide.812 as the prevalence of asthma increases so does the importance of understanding whether children with asthma are at increased risk of pd . the aim of the current study was to evaluate the association between asthma and the development of pd among danish children born between 1994 and 2007 . we calculated the frequency and proportion of children with and without asthma within categories of demographic variables and birth outcomes as well as age specific incidence rates of pd . because underlying comorbidity is known to substantially increase the risk of pd in children20 and because it was strongly associated with childhood asthma exposure in our study population we evaluated the impact of comorbidity on the association between asthma and pd in stratified analyses . we calculated the frequency and proportion of children with and without asthma within categories of demographic variables and birth outcomes as well as age specific incidence rates of pd . because underlying comorbidity is known to substantially increase the risk of pd in children20 and because it was strongly associated with childhood asthma exposure in our study population we evaluated the impact of comorbidity on the association between asthma and pd in stratified analyses . pd incidence rates in asthmatic children were consistently higher than in nonasthmatic children with the exception of children aged 0 to 6 months . the unadjusted irr associating asthma with incident pd among all children was 2.4 95 ci 2.1 2.6 . the adjusted irr associating asthma with incident pd among all children was 2.2 95 ci 2.0 2.5 in order of increasing age strata the adjusted irrs were 0.4 95 ci 0.2 0.8 in children 0 to 6 months old 2.1 95 ci 1.8 2.5 in children 6 to 24 months old 4.1 95 ci 3.3 5.1 in children 24 to 60 months old and 2.3 95 ci 1.6 3.2 in children 60 months old table 2 . restricting the study population to children who did have selected comorbidities or malformations however revealed that comorbidity was an effect modifier of the association between asthma and pd in children aged 24 to 60 months and 60 months table 3 . evaluation of biologic interaction between asthma and comorbidity on the incidence of pd in these age groups showed that the rate of pd was greater among those with a recorded diagnosis of both asthma and comorbidity compared with the rate that would be expected based on the independent effects of asthma or comorbidity alone . figure 1 shows that among children aged 24 to 60 months old the unadjusted incidence rate of pd in children with both asthma and comorbidity was 7.5 times the rate in children with asthma alone and that after adjusting for confounding variables 55 95 ci 31 79 of pd cases among asthmatic children could be attributed to the presence of both asthma and comorbidity at the same time . among children aged 60 months old the unadjusted irr of pd in children with both asthma and comorbidity was 14 times the rate in children with asthma alone and the adjusted percentage of pd cases attributable to biologic interaction increased to 73 95 ci 52 93 . pd incidence rates in asthmatic children were consistently higher than in nonasthmatic children with the exception of children aged 0 to 6 months . the unadjusted irr associating asthma with incident pd among all children was 2.4 95 ci 2.1 2.6 . the adjusted irr associating asthma with incident pd among all children was 2.2 95 ci 2.0 2.5 in order of

95 ci 1.6 3.2 in children 60 months old table 2 . restricting the study population to children who did have selected comorbidities or malformations however revealed that comorbidity was an effect modifier of the association between asthma and pd in children aged 24 to 60 months and 60 months table 3 . evaluation of biologic interaction between asthma and comorbidity on the incidence of pd in

adjusted percentage of pd cases attributable to biologic interaction increased to 73 95 ci 52 93 . this study provides evidence that asthma is an important risk factor for the development of pd in children and it provides new insight about a potentially meaningful interaction between asthma and comorbidity on the risk of pd . consistent with data presented by talbot et al2 we observed a twofold increased rate of pd among all children 18 years old following a childhood asthma diagnosis compared with person time before an asthma diagnosis or in children who never had an asthma diagnosis after adjusting for confounding factors . instead we suspect that this observation is due to the difficulty of reliably diagnosing asthma in very young children.24 the evaluation of a biological interaction between childhood asthma and comorbidity on the incidence of pd revealed that the combined effect of these two exposures was synergistic in older children and that a high proportion 55 in children aged 24 to 60 months and 73 in children aged 60 months of the pd incidence among asthmatic children with comorbidities was attributable to this interaction . these results suggest that children more than 2 years old who have underlying comorbidities are more sensitive to the effect of asthma on pd than children more than 2 years old without comorbidities . similar results were observed in our study in children between 2 years and 5 years old the association between asthma and incident pd was lower among children with underlying comorbid conditions compared with children without underlying illnesses adjusted irr 2.9 versus 4.2 respectively . next the interaction contrast ratio icr and 95 confidence interval around the icr was calculated to quantify the excess rate when both asthma and

diabetes mellitus n 8 cigarette smoking n 54 hypertension n 36 or obesity n 62 . coronary plaques were classified as non calcified plaques without visible calcification mixed plaques with non calcified and calcified components or calcified plaques completely calcified plaques according to the calcified component of the plaques seen on ccta . we also compared the patients with cad to the normal subjects with respect to the coronary risk factors and a fatty liver . all the subjects had conventional coronary risk factors such as diabetes mellitus n 8 cigarette smoking n 54 hypertension n 36 or obesity n 62 . coronary plaques were classified as non calcified plaques without visible calcification mixed plaques with non calcified and calcified components or calcified plaques completely calcified plaques according to the calcified component of the plaques seen on ccta . we also compared the patients with cad to the normal subjects with respect to the coronary risk factors and a fatty liver . the patient population included four of 77 subjects 5 with a low cad risk six of 27 22 with a moderate risk and two of eight 25 with a high cad risk . the prevalence of cad was significantly higher in the moderate cad risk group than that in the low risk group p 0.018 however there was no significant difference between the moderate and high risk groups p 0.604 fig . the presence of obesity hypertension hypercholesterolemia high triglycerides and fatty liver was significantly higher in the patients with cad than that in the normal individuals . there also tended to be a higher incidence of cigarette smoking high ldl low density lipoprotein cholesterol low hdl high density lipoprotein cholesterol diabetes mellitus and high c reactive protein in the patients with cad however any statistical significance was not identified table 1 . the changes in the vascular diameter at the cad site were measured in four coronary segments with noncalcified plaque and in seven with mixed plaques . early detection of cad provides the opportunity to initiate interventions that will stabilize existing lesions including ldl lowering drug therapy statins smoking cessation intervention for cigarette smokers blood pressure lowering for persons with hypertension and lifestyle intervention for the physically inactive and obese . 10 in which cad was evaluated using ccta in 1000 middle aged asymptomatic adults mean age 50 years cad was noted in 215 subjects 22 . this rate is higher than that observed in earlier studies 3 5 and the results were confirmed by coronary angiography in the asymptomatic individuals 11 13 . to date there is a paucity of data regarding the prevalence of atherosclerotic plaques as detected on ccta in asymptomatic young adults and this is largely because these asymptomatic young adults typically do not undergo medical evaluations for cad . 40 years of age who were at risk for cad coronary plaques were demonstrated in 11 of the subjects and the prevalence of cad was significantly higher in the subjects with moderate 22 or high 25 risk than in those subjects with low risk 5 . this finding may indicate an important cause for underestimating cad on coronary angiography and it may explain the acute coronary syndrome of young patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries 14 16 . this may have resulted from the limited temporal resolution of ccta which would underestimate the small branches of the coronary arteries or it may also result from a lower prevalence of plaques in those segments in patients with early stage cad . however it sometimes fails to predict acute coronary events or significant stenosis because a significant numbers of vulnerable plaques tend to be predominantly noncalcified and nonstenotic lesions 20 . in our study 27 of the patients with cad had only noncalcified plaques which is slightly higher than the 19 reported by choi et al . therefore the coronary calcium score may underestimate cad in young adults to a greater degree than that in older individuals . obesity smoking hypertension and hypercholesterolemia are well known risk factors for cad and their incidences were significantly higher in the patients with cad than that in the normal subjects of our study . therefore the actual prevalence of cad in the young asymptomatic subjects in various ethnic groups and geographic regions may differ from our results although this was evaluated in relation to the ncep cad risk categories . in conclusion the prevalence of occult cad was not negligible in asymptomatic young adults and the prevalence of cad was significantly higher in those subjects with moderate to high risks than in those with low risk . this study suggests the importance of management and risk factor modification for the asymptomatic young adults who have a moderate or high risk for cad .", " several risk factors such as contact lens wear trauma ocular surface disease ocular surgery and systemic disease have been reported to predispose patients to corneal infections . management of microbial keratitis commonly involves obtaining corneal scrapings for microbiological studies and then empiric broad spectrum treatment is typically initiated before culture results are available . thus it is essential to establish related information on microbial keratitis including patient specific risk factors and the most likely causative organisms which would facilitate the development of effective strategies for the prevention diagnosis and treatment of microbial keratitis . in taiwan a study from a university hospital reported that contact lens related pseudomonas keratitis was the most common form of microbial keratitis from 1992 to 2001 . therefore the present study collected data on the predisposing factors clinical manifestations spectrum of microorganisms and treatments for patients with microbial keratitis who were admitted to and treated at chang gung memorial hospital cgmh a major teaching hospital in northern taiwan from 2003 to 2012 . we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 558 patients with infectious keratitis who were admitted to cgmh from january 1 2003 to december 31 2012 . demographics and clinical features of microbial keratitis risk factors for microbial keratitis were identified in 426 patients 76.3 . predisposing factors for microbial keratitis positive culture results were obtained in 353 patients 63.3 . isolated organisms in microbial keratitis table 4 lists isolated organisms from patients with different risk factors for microbial keratitis . gram negative bacteria particularly p. aeruginosa mainly accounted for contact lens related keratitis 52.9 . keratitis associated with ocular and systemic diseases was mainly caused by bacteria 33.8 and 29.4 for gram positive and gram negative bacteria respectively . risk factors versus isolated organisms in microbial keratitis all patients were initially treated with empiric antimicrobials which were adjusted on the basis of the clinical response and the results of the drug susceptibility test . isolated organisms in microbial keratitis table 4 lists isolated organisms from patients with different risk factors for microbial keratitis . gram negative bacteria particularly p. aeruginosa mainly accounted for contact lens related keratitis 52.9 . keratitis associated with ocular and systemic diseases was mainly caused by bacteria 33.8 and 29.4 for gram positive and gram negative bacteria respectively . optimal clinical practice for the prevention and treatment of microbial keratitis should account for patient specific risk factors and possible causative organisms in different regions . in this study we focused on patients admitted with microbial keratitis first we ensured that only patients with severe infection leading to admission were included in this study and second we used the same or as similar as possible criteria as used in a previous report conducted at another university hospital in northern taiwan between 1992 and 2001 to provide updated regional epidemiological information . our findings showed that contact lens wear remained the leading risk factor for inpatient microbial keratitis and the trend increased significantly over the 10year study period p. aeruginosa was the most common causative organism . in the current study risk factors for microbial keratitis from 2003 to 2012 were contact lens wear ocular and systemic diseases trauma and previous ocular surgery in descending order which was similar to the results of a previous taiwanese report . rattanatam et al found that the number of patients with contact lens related microbial keratitis decreased in their hospital suggesting that a higher number of such patients were treated in the community after the introduction of fluoroquinolones . by contrast our study demonstrated an increasing trend in the rate of contact lens related microbial keratitis in our hospital over the 10year study period p 0.011 . in a prospective population based study of contact lens related microbial keratitis in australia risk factors for infections included overnight use poor storage case hygiene smoking internet purchase of contact lenses less than 6 months wear experience and higher socioeconomic class however new lens types did not reduce the incidence of infection . notably 4 of 5 previous studies in europe and taiwan investigating microbiological findings of hospitalized patients with microbial keratitis have reported that gram negative bacteria are the most common causative organism . this finding might suggest that microbial keratitis caused by gram negative bacteria particularly pseudomonas species tends to be severe and progresses rapidly thus requiring admission . morbidities caused by microbial keratitis can be assessed on the basis of surgical intervention hospital stay and visual loss . in this study we did not analyze the predictors for poor visual outcome in microbial keratitis because of visual assessments with variable follow up intervals . in conclusion p. aeruginosa was the most common causative organism and contact lens wear was the most common risk factor for microbial keratitis there was a significant increase in the percentage of contact lens related keratitis during the 10year study period in taiwan . microbial keratitis has the potential to cause devastating visual impairment and major costs to the public health system our findings provide updated information and facilitate future prevention and treatment of microbial keratitis in taiwan .", " since 1997 provinces have adopted privacy legislation that specifically applies to healthcare providers regardless of whether they are engaged in commercial activities peekhaus 2008 and currently nine provinces have specific laws that protect phi and impose obligations on healthcare providers to protect that information canadian hiv aids legal network 2014 . consent disclosure and circle of care are key constructs outlined in phipa that have important implications on the activities and decision making of hics with regard to phi . phipa was specifically designed so that it would not prevent a barrier to the disclosure of personal health information among healthcare providers hics are permitted to disclose phi for the purposes of providing or assisting in providing care on the basis of implied or assumed implied consent canadian hiv aids legal network 2014 cavoukian and rossos 2009 . at the same time phipa permits disclosure of phi without implied consent in a number of vague and unspecified circumstances including providing healthcare as an individual healthcare provider or as a facility managing risks and error beardwood and kerr 2004 planning and management of the health system and analysis of the health system etc . implied consent and disclosure within the circle of care for the purposes of providing or assisting in the provision of healthcare is arguably the most significant provision in phipa yet it is buried in a sub section of the legislation beardwood and kerr 2004 65 . permitting disclosure of phi in a variety of circumstances for the broad purposes of providing healthcare vis vis a focus on implied consent means that hics need to use little or no effort to comply with the requirements of phipa beardwood and kerr 2004 67 . therefore while it is essential that people who use health services trust that their privacy will be protected at the same time the delivery of high quality healthcare depends on the availability of accurate and complete health information phipa attempts to strike a balance between protecting privacy and facilitating care delivery fletcher 2014 . although healthcare providers may mention hiv status in the process of delivering care to the patient it may result in disclosure of phi to a non hic or someone outside of the circle of care for example hospital visitors . regardless of whether a patient articulates if it is safe to disclose their hiv status is not the point when hiv status is disclosed without a person s express consent the attempt to strike a balance between maintaining privacy while delivering high quality healthcare is not achieved . most privacy breaches are avoidable even if conducted by well intentioned healthcare providers regardless of the intention behind the behaviour the effect and consequences are the same fletcher 2014 and hics who willfully collect use or disclose phi in contravention of phipa can be found liable beardwood and kerr 2005 . patients have the choice to withdraw their consent for the use and disclosure of phi to other healthcare providers who deliver care but the details of how this would be achieved as well as how the hic would monitor patient consent are unclear . patients are encouraged to stand up for and assert their rights to privacy canadian hiv aids legal network 2014 fletcher 2014 but is this a realistic expectation and outcome although disclosure of phi often occurs by well intentioned healthcare providers wlwh believe there will be serious repercussions if they call on healthcare providers who have disclosed their hiv status to account for their inappropriate behaviour ion et al . it is critical to consider the legislative frameworks pertaining to privacy through the lens of hiv because hiv has been classified as phi that is particularly sensitive cavoukian 1990 gostin 1995 . could the healthcare system be organized differently to decrease the chance of a privacy breach and to facilitate the appropriate collection use and disclosure of phi including hiv status a number of steps can be taken to optimize information practices to ensure the phi of wlwh is protected and remains confidential . it must also be recognized that not only do plwh have a right to privacy regarding their phi hics owe a duty to plwh to keep their phi confidential canadian hiv aids legal network 2004 . at the macro level of legislation the canadian hiv aids legal network has taken issue with the discretionary disclosure clauses inherent in health privacy legislation noting that these clauses fail to provide the level of privacy protection accorded to health information under the canadian charter of rights and freedoms canadian hiv aids legal network 2004 . for example just because discretionary disclosure clauses permit disclosure of phi under privacy legislation does not mean that the disclosure is necessary and valuable for the provision of care canadian hiv aids legal network 2004 . the canadian hiv aids legal network 2004 has offered recommendations regarding how the healthcare system and its legislative and regulatory structures could be better organized to protect the privacy of plwh . also a number of scholars have spoken out to highlight public opinion regarding how governments handle phi peekhaus 2008 why hiv should be framed as health information that is particularly sensitive canadian hiv aids legal network 2004 2012 2014 and how issues of privacy and hiv related stigma complicate access to care and result in negative

aging is positively correlated with an increasing risk of cardiac problems including arrhythmias and is a major independent risk factor for cardiovascular related morbidity and mortality . although cardiovascular risk increases with age in both sexes the increase in age associated risk appears to be sharper in women . the incidences of ischemia cardiac failure and cardiac rupture in addition to ventricular remodeling have also been shown to differ between genders with aging and often lead to worse outcomes in women 1215 . consistent with this notion each year of increasing age at natural menopause has been found to be associated with a 2 increase in total cardiovascular mortality 22 23 . whether differences in estrogen alone or changes in estrogen along with other factors can fully explain the sex related differences in age related cardiovascular function is unknown and requires further investigation . importantly there are a number of different animal models that can be used to acquire information on how aging affects the female cardiovascular system . comparisons between aging research in female rats models and humans can be complicated due to the differences in the mechanisms of ovarian hormone aging in human females and its potential impact on cardiovascular disease . like that seen in menopausal human females ovariectomy in rats also increases cardiovascular risk 42 43 . studies have found that the majority of human females who undergo natural menopause exhibit different age associated cardiovascular alterations than those who underwent ovariectomy induced menopause . therefore other age related causes must occur independently of estrogen loss that promotes cvd in postmenopausal human females as is shown by the fact that estrogen replacement therapy is not cardioprotective after menopause 53 54 . in light of the fact that within human females natural menopause and ovariectomy results altered hormonal profiles and cardiovascular risk the data suggest that age associated cardiovascular disease in human females may be associated with both time dependent hormone deprivation and age associated changes in structure function and protein signaling . of note is the fact that most studies have used ovariectomized female rats at young ages 612 weeks old to examine the effects of hormone deprivation on the cardiovascular system which can lead to unreliable results given that the cardiovascular system has not yet aged . the increased risk of cvd in human females may be due to differences in the type or magnitude of age associated alterations in cardiac structure and function . additionally no significant change was noted with myocardium left ventricular or right ventricular free wall weight in the aging human female heart with no underlying cardiovascular pathology nor were age associated changes detected in proportion shapes size or number of mononucleated and binucleated cardiac myocytes . given this information it appears that natural aging in human females is not associated with cardiac remodeling during or after menopause in the absence of preexisting pathologies or loading abnormalities . although a limited number of studies have looked at how cardiac structure and function change with age in female rats very few have directly investigated how sex may affect cardiac structure and function . go demonstrated that cardiovascular aging in male and female rats demonstrated significant gender differences in lv size and function . boluyt and colleagues investigated how aging may affect cardiac structure and function in female f344 rats using echocardiography . aging female rat cardiac structural changes included a dilatation of the left ventricle between 13 and 22 months of age . fannin and colleagues found that increased age in the female f344xbn was associated with increases in oxidative stress and damage . the presence of age associated cardiac structural changes in the f344 and f344xbn animal models calls into question the use of these strains for translational data in light of the absence of age associated change in human females reported by olivetti et al . fannin and colleagues found that the arrhythmias were not significantly higher in older female f344xbn rats when compared with younger rats however the study did find that valvular dysfunction was increased in the older rats when compared to the younger ones . one potential indirect mechanism may be related to the ability of estradiol to reduce the incidence of cardiac ischemia . although multiple studies have investigated ekg changes in aging rats these parameters have not been determined in the nia approved aging f344xbn rat model . aging in the male rat heart is associated with the accumulation of oxidative damage to lipids and proteins as well as decline in mitochondrial enzymes . although aging is associated with increases in oxidative stress in both male and female rat hearts female rat hearts exhibited lower mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production oxidative damage and a greater mitochondria differentiation compared to that seen in male animals . aging female and male hearts have shown increased apoptosis and inflammation as well as age associated gender differences in nfb signaling . to our knowledge only a few studies have investigated the changes in nfb expression and activity in the aging female rat heart . in rats increased age has been shown to cause apoptotic susceptibility in the heart following oxidative injury 130 131 . in humans a higher number of tunel positive myocytes are seen in young males compared to females aging appears to increase cardiac apoptosis in male but not female however there was no gender difference in apoptosis in male and female f344 rat 92 135 . like humans rats also appear to exhibit several age associated changes in vascular structure and function including changes in intimal thickening elevations in inflammation associated molecule expression and increased evidence of oxidative stress 4 140 . similar to that seen in other parts of the cardiovascular system differences in aortic structure and function between genders have also been observed in the aging human and animals . in summary the loss of ovarian function during aging may influence cardiovascular structure and function . however the fact that human females do not display cardiac hypertrophy or myocyte loss in the absence of loading abnormalities with aging may suggest the presence of estrogen prior to menopause acts to attenuate the cardiac response to preexisting underlying pathologies . in order to overcome the difficulties found in aging human research ethics cost and long lifespan rat models have been used to provide great insight in investigating age related changes in cardiovascular structure and function . however additional research examining how aging may affect cardiac structure and function in rats is needed to determine whether the alterations seen in rats mimic the changes seen in humans . aging associated increases in oxidative stress can lead to alterations in the cardiac cell signaling which may lead to deleterious changes in the heart . because cardiac structure function signaling and hormonal response appear to differ between male and female rats and humans with aging care must be taken in evaluating current literature with regard to specific finding and gender . studies investigating the details of cardiac signaling with gender and aging are likely to lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for cardiovascular diseases in both male and females .", " in addition some information is given how to make an evaluation of human exposure to ota on the base of the found concentrations of ota in human serum via calculating the daily ota intake of humans in endemic areas . this circumstance in addition to low feed food levels of ota in bulgarian mpn and ben suggest a possible interaction between ota and other mycotoxins which needs to be proved figure 3 . it is known that experimental pigs exposed to ota contaminated feed at levels of about 200 ppb develop only microscopic lesions after a period of 34 months 24 25 . on the other hand the low contamination levels of ota in pigs chicks feeds suggest a possible synergism between ota and other compounds produced by the same ochratoxinogenic fungi . it is very likely that feeds contain other nephrotoxic mycotoxins or compounds which enhance the toxicity or produce a synergistic interaction with ota such as pa fumonisin b1 fb1 citrinin viomelein xanthomegnin etc . the higher toxicity of ota in all above mentioned studies might be due to synergistic toxic effects between ota and pa as has been reported in mice 41 42 and in poultry . such synergism between ota and pa or other mycotoxins under field conditions may be responsible for the spontaneous mycotoxic nephropathy in bulgaria which can be caused by relatively low contamination levels of ota in feed 18 21 23 . this could explain why the low levels of ota in bulgarian feeds for pigs 18 21 chickens or humans have such high toxic effect on kidneys when ingested with spontaneous contaminated feeds . the concentration of ota in feeding forages is probably more important than that of pa because the higher contamination levels of pa 60000 ppb pa in combine with 1000 ppb ota have not been able to produce more significant toxic effects . several years ago stoev and collaborators induced macroscopic kidney damages in pigs fed on a mouldy diet containing low levels of ota 180 ppb in combination with pa for a 3 months feeding period whereas microscopic lesions in kidneys in the same experiment were observed in pigs fed on a diet containing only 90 ppb ota in combination with pa . the observed changes were similar to those caused in pigs at the end of the 4month period of exposure to higher levels markedly above 200 ppb of pure ota in feed . in combined administration of ota and pa much lower concentrations of ota about 100 ppb are enough for a significant toxic effect in chickens expressed by degenerative changes in internal organs by a depletion of cells in lymphoid tissue and decrease of lymphoid organ s weight as well by known changes in various biochemical parameters . moreover degenerative and weight changes in kidneys liver and lymphoid organs as well as immunosuppression were seen recently in chickens at only 0.2 or 0.3 ppm ota in combination with pa 26 27 29 30 47 whereas such changes had been seen in chickens exposed to significantly higher levels of pure ota about 4 ppm in feed 4851 . the mentioned above low experimental levels of ota correspond very well to the feed levels of ota found in spontaneous cases of mycotoxic avian nephropathy man in bulgaria 0.090.31 ppm which suggests a possible multicausal nature of man in bulgaria . in such a way the extent to which ota may interact with other components of commercial chicken pig rations or human food compounded from agricultural produce may also influence the significance of the relatively lower doses of ota that commercial chickens 23 27 pigs 18 21 or humans may encounter in some feed food . various different strategies can be employed to reduce human animal exposure to ota or to reduce its toxic effects when it is fed to animals . the same include the use of management practices to prevent the production of ota by the storage fungi the feeding of contaminated grain to animal species that are less susceptible to the toxic effects of ota such as ruminants modification of the diet to promote enhanced hydrolysis of ota in the gastrointestinal tract or reduced absorption the use of a feeding regimen that can counteract the metabolic effects of ota the use of various procedures that can destroy ota such as physical and chemical methods for decontamination of commodities as well as the use of various feed additives which can protect against the toxic effects of ota etc . gastrointestinal microorganisms have a large effect on the disposition of ota because they promote the hydrolysis of ota to its nontoxic form ot. the bioavailability of ota in sheep fed grain was 4.3 times greater than that in sheep fed hay . thus the rumen of the sheep has an important role in the detoxification of ota and the type of diet affects the rate and extent of this process . as a result the bioavailability of ota and probably the toxicity to ruminants is decreased . in addition the intestinal microflora of nonruminant animals also affect the bioavailability of ota because the microorganisms in the intestines and particularly in the caecum and large intestine are also responsible for the hydrolysis of ota to its nontoxic form ot . however the supplementation of ota contaminated diet with activated charcoal was considered as an impractical method of reducing ota toxicity in chicks or pigs that were continuously consuming ota . in addition the faecal excretion of ota was significantly increased in rats given a single oral dose of ota which were fed on diet containing cholestyramine . the concentration of protein in the diet of growing chicks was also shown to ameliorate the toxicity of ota 97 98 . the use of various feed additives can also protect against the toxic effects of ota and can reduce farm losses from a decrease of weight gain in stock chicks avoiding the rejecttion or condemnation of ota contaminated feed 27 30 94 . moreover it appeared that all of the mentioned above antidotes used as supplements to the feeds especially sesame seed and artichoke extract had a potent protective effect against ota induced toxicity and could be used as a practical approach for safely utilizing of ota contaminated feed . this resulted in eightfold and fourfold higher levels of ota in serum and liver of mice respectively during the first 12 h which could also increase its elimination . it is known that ota induces an increase of the weight of the organs taking part in its detoxification or elimination kidneys and liver as well as a decrease of the lymphoid organs weight and body weight whereas some of the studied feed additives 5 artichoke extract 0.02 roxazyme g 8 sesame seed 0.0025 phenylalanine significantly protects against these weight changes as the protective effect of sesame seed and roxazyme g against these weight changes was stronger than the protective effect of artichoke extract and phenylalanine . the absence of a confident increase in that parameters in artichoke extract and rosallsat treated groups suggests a slight impairment in kidney function in these groups and confirms the protective effects of these feed additives against ota toxicity . in addition the toxicological investigations in the same experiments revealed that the contamination levels of ota in kidneys are lower in chicks treated with artichoke or rosallsat in addition to ota than in chicks only treated with the same feed level of ota . in countries with wide spreading of mpn and man residues of ota were often found in animal tissues samples during the meat inspection 18 23 114 115 116 . the contamination levels of ota in liver muscles and fat tissues of pigs can be easily found using the following experimental calculations by 1990 at least nine countries have regulations for ota levels or had proposed and enforced official limits for ota . because of the absence of correlation between macroscopic changes and concentration of ota in pig kidneys it is very difficult to prevent the exposure of humans to the toxin from pork by toxicological investigations of pale or mottled kidneys as it is occurred in denmark . therefore the regulations in denmark according to which all enlarged and mottled kidneys are investigated for residues of ota at slaughter time and all carcasses whose kidneys contained ota levels above 10 g kg are condemned are not very safe and clever because macrscopic changes in kidneys can be found only after 13 months ota exposure via the feeds 22 118 . some investigations made by various authors revealed that at least 12 months are needed to develop characteristic macroscopical renal lesions in pigs exposed to natural or experimental ota contaminated barley 24 119 . unfortunately characteristic for mpn macroscopic changes in kidneys can not be found after a shorter period of ota exposure via the feeds even with such high levels as 1000 ppb ota and animal products containing dangerous ota contamination levels could easily pass meat inspection at slaughterhouses . on the other hand the renal lesions in kidneys mottled appearance induced at an early age do not disappear when the pigs are fed on ota free diet which also indicates the lack of efficiency of such control system and the implementation of some unnecessary toxicological investigations which could be avoided 21 22 . since the toxin is relatively heat stable a limited occurrence of ota might anticipated in prepared food from such animals . because of the assumption that mycotoxins and especially ota are involved in etiology of balkan endemic nephropathy 1 122124 the exposure of humans to this very hazardous toxin from pork or chicken meat by the way feed pork chicken food need to be prevented . because of the short half life of ota in pigs 72 120 hours and especially in chickens 4 hours its concentration in blood and various tissues quickly decreases after changing the feed source or after prolonging the period of feed deprivation before slaughtering . however having in mind that a combined administration of ota and other mycotoxins such a pa often occurrs in the practice and synergistic effects between ota and the same mycotoxins are reported the lower contamination levels of ota in food feed would be also very dangerous for human and animal health 22 30 . in endemic areas ota has been found in human blood as well as in human food 123 126 130 131 132 and in animal feed in higher concentrations than in nonendemic areas or the countries without ben . it is important to mention that the feed levels of ota in animal feeds from endemic for mpn regions 38552 ppb are approximately the same as in the foods from endemic for ben regions 10890 ppb which additionally suggest a possible common etiology . it can be supposed that only the free ota in the macroorganism has a toxic effect on the tissues as well that continuous persistence of ota in human blood and its slow excretion via kidneys may be influenced on the slow progression of ben . thus consumption of food containing very low concentrations of ota over a long period of time may become toxicologically significant . a method is also presented for calculating the daily consumption of ota through various food products on the basis of the measured content in plasma even though the toxicokinetic constants are unknown . the daily intake of humans calculated on the basis of the average plasma levels of ota in endemic area in bulgaria was found to be between 26.8 and 36.4 ng kg b. w. as can be seen from table 5 1 124 . due to the potent toxic and synergistic effects of ota and pa or citrinin 22 150 as well as between ota and fb1 151 152 simultaneous exposure to those mycotoxins might be an important factor for development of chronic renal diseases in animals and humans especially after long term exposure . because of that it is of great importance to investigate the combined effect between ota and other mycotoxins produced by the same species as it is occurred in field conditions .", " pa aneurysms present several problems for direct surgical clipping that is difficult exposure via an interhemispheric approach especially in a swollen brain after subarachnoid hemorrhage sah sacrifice of a bridging vein for adequate surgical exposure thus increasing the risk of postoperative morbidity difficult controlling the parent artery and the unfavorable orientation of the aneurysm fundus . a search of the literature revealed relatively few studies have been performed on the endovascular treatment of ruptured pa aneurysms and that the studies performed involved relatively small numbers of patient . accordingly it is evident that the effectiveness and safety of the endovascular treatment of ruptured pa aneurysms have not been well defined . we retrospectively analyzed the angiographic and clinical records of all patients that underwent endovascular treatment for a ruptured pa aneurysm at our institution from september 2003 to december 2013 . the treatment strategy for ruptured pa aneurysm at our institution was to attempt endovascular treatment as the first line treatment . coiling of aneurysms was performed under local anesthesia and intravenous bolus injection of standard heparin was not performed during the procedure . by using these means all aneurysms were reached with a microcatheter . immediately after the procedure furthermore all patients underwent a non enhanced brain computed tomography ct scan to evaluate possible hemorrhagic complications . we retrospectively analyzed the angiographic and clinical records of all patients that underwent endovascular treatment for a ruptured pa aneurysm at our institution from september 2003 to december 2013 . the treatment strategy for ruptured pa aneurysm at our institution was to attempt endovascular treatment as the first line treatment . coiling of aneurysms was performed under local anesthesia and intravenous bolus injection of standard heparin was not performed during the procedure . immediately after the procedure furthermore all patients underwent a non enhanced brain computed tomography ct scan to evaluate possible hemorrhagic complications . the microcatheter was navigated into the lumen of the pa aneurysm and coils were delivered in all 30 patient . the treatment of 19 aneurysms was straightforward but the other 11 required an adjunctive technique that is double catheter balloon assisted or a stent assisted technique . immediate post procedural angiograms showed complete aneurysm occlusion in 21 2130 70.0 and near complete occlusion in 9 930 30.0 . of these six patients with periprocedural rebleeding five had small 4 mm aneurysms but one had large 9.9 mm and multi lobulated aneurysm . according to the follow up images obtained 9 of the 10 initially occluded aneurysms remained completely occluded and the remaining one showed partial recanalization due to coil compaction . the microcatheter was navigated into the lumen of the pa aneurysm and coils were delivered in all 30 patient . the treatment of 19 aneurysms was straightforward but the other 11 required an adjunctive technique that is double catheter balloon assisted or a stent assisted technique . immediate post procedural angiograms showed complete aneurysm occlusion in 21 2130 70.0 and near complete occlusion in 9 930 30.0 . of these six patients with periprocedural rebleeding five had small 4 mm aneurysms but one had large 9.9 mm and multi lobulated aneurysm . according to the follow up images obtained 9 of the 10 initially occluded aneurysms remained completely occluded and the remaining one showed partial recanalization due to coil compaction . we found that the pa could be reached and coiling of the aneurysm accomplished in all 30 patients . waldenberger et al.25 reported that the most important negative contributor to the outcome of pa aneurysm coiling was the presence of ich and this was followed by thromboembolic complications and poor preoperative status . ruptured pa aneurysms cause ich in addition to sah in more than one half of cases and are associated with poorer outcomes after rupture than aneurysms in other locations311 . in a recently reported meta analysis of endovascular treatment of pa aneurysms including 16 studies the authors concluded that endovascular treatment of pa aneurysms is associated with high angiographic occlusion rates but the complication rates are higher compared with other aneurysms in the circle of willis . a review of the literature revealed pa aneurysms have a higher procedure related rupture rate than non pa aneurysms . keston et al.9 reported an intraprocedural rupture rate of 18 317 patients for pa aneurysms which compared with an overall departmental five year 1999 2003 inclusive intraprocedural rupture rate of only 1.1 7640 patients for non pa aneurysms . nguyen et al.15 reported a 12 325 patients procedure related perforation rate in their endovascular series of pa aneurysms . we believe this difference could explain the higher intraprocedural rupture rate in the endovascular treatment of ruptured pa aneurysms . in addition to aneurysm size the risk of procedure induced perforation may also be related to anatomical peculiarities . incomplete embolization adjacent hematoma small aneurysms and post procedural anticoagulation have been reported to be associated with early rebleeding after coiling . the cerebral aneurysm rerupture after treatment study reported that the risk of posttreatment rebleeding was closely associated with the degree of aneurysm occlusion7 . however we experienced three cases with early rebleeding after coiling 10.0 despite all three aneurysms being complete embolized during the procedure . on the other hand cho et al.2 who reported on early recurrent hemorrhage after coil embolization in ruptured intracranial aneurysms hypothesized another possibility that rebleeding with ich may be caused by delayed hemorrhage or propagation of the initial ich due to vulnerability of the parenchyma adjacent to the ich rather than by rebleeding of the coiled aneurysm . early rebleeding after coiling of a ruptured aneurysm and intra procedural rupture are major concerns because associated mortality rates are high . when a ruptured pa aneurysm accompanied by adjacent hematoma decisions regarding endovascular treatment should be taken only after carefully considering the possibility of periprocedural rebleeding . therefore it may be better to consider the surgical clipping of a ruptured pa aneurysm with adjacent hematoma as a first option to prevent periprocedural rebleeding . recurrence after coiling has been reported to be associated primarily with aneurysm size7162226 . in one study follow up angiographic studies after complete occlusion showed recurrence rates of 14 for aneurysms of 5 mm 27 for aneurysms of 5 10 mm and 57 for aneurysms of 10 mm23 . therefore the lower rate of recurrence in our series could have been due to the lower proportion of cases with aneurysms 5 mm 930 30.0 . nonetheless our findings suggest that the endovascular treatment of ruptured pa aneurysms appears to be a valid treatment strategy given suitable levels of institutional and operator expertise .", " various strategies to overcome venous occlusion exist including contralateral lead or device implantation venoplasty and surgical epicardial lead implantation . lead extraction may be an alternative option to overcome this problem but it is not without risk and this should be weighed against the benefits of removing any leads and also the likelihood of symptom recurrence in cases where there are symptoms of venous occlusion . the practice of laser lead extraction to re canalize venous obstruction has previously been described in a limited number of patients and the suitability of this technique on a larger scale has not been reported . we describe our experience using laser lead extraction to overcome venous occlusion to enable ipsilateral device revision andor upgrade . complications are classified according to those recommended in the heart rhythm society consensus report on transvenous lead extraction . patients from this database were included in the present study if the indication for lead extraction was to upgrade or revise an existing device in the presence of ipsilateral venous obstruction . in patients with ipsilateral venous occlusion or stenoses severe enough such that a hydrophilic guide wire would not cross the obstruction laser lead extraction with retention of the outer sheath in the vascular tree was performed . table 2device characteristicscharacteristicdevice n vvi2 3 ddd17 24 icd26 37 crt p7 9 crt d19 27indication for extraction n lead failure40 56

long term device follow up was available in 65 of 71 92 cases with a mean follow up of 26 19 months . we have described our experience using laser lead extraction to overcome ipsilateral venous obstruction in patients undergoing device revision andor upgrade . to date this is the largest series of cases where laser lead extraction has been used to overcome venous obstruction thereby allowing ipsilateral lead revision or device upgrade . in 100 of cases the targeted leads were completely extracted and in 94 re canalization of the obstructed vein allowed successful lead implantation via the laser sheath . the heart rhythm society hrs consensus statement on lead extraction in relation to venous obstruction states that lead removal is a class i recommendation in patients with ipsilateral venous occlusion preventing additional lead placement when there is a contraindication for using the contralateral side e.g. lead removal in patients with ipsilateral venous occlusion and no contraindication to using the contralateral side is a class iia indication . in such cases it may be possible to obtain venous access with a de novo puncture but it is often not possible to advance introducer sheaths across a very tight stenosis and there is the added risk of increased lead lead interaction . in three patients where the laser was only used up to the point of obstruction and the lead left in situ . included 18 patients where laser lead extraction was performed to facilitate system upgrade in the presence of central venous occlusion . this necessitated extraction of a functional atrial lead to ensure maintenance of venous patency . also our study included patients requiring non functional lead extraction rather than just device upgrade . therefore 98 of leads were removed using the laser sheath alone and in total venous access was maintained with the outer sheath in 94 of cases . lead malfunction was the primary indication for revision in 56 of our cases and the use of the laser sheath to overcome obstruction and remove the malfunctioning lead represents an attractive option in such cases . use of other venous access sites such as the internal jugular vein with subsequent tunnelling of leads has been described however lead erosion remains an issue . our results suggest that laser lead extraction to overcome ipsilateral venous obstruction is effective and safe and therefore represents an attractive approach to deal with device upgrade lead revision in patients with obstructed or severely stenosed venous anatomy .", " with increasing life expectancy growth in the elderly population and an alarming escalation of chronic inflammatory and age related conditions such as oa it is a mechanically unique and resilient connective tissue responsible for load bearing and low friction movement in the synovial joints of all vertebrates buckwalter et al . osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease that involves joint inflammation bone remodeling and catabolic destruction of the articular cartilage component goldring and goldring 2007 samuels et al . the degradation and release of proteins and glycoproteins from cartilage in oa can vary according to the stage of the disease process . for example elevated serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein comp is correlated with the presence of oa and disease severity clark et al . aging is a major contributor to musculoskeletal degeneration and the development of oa hamerman 1998 lotz and carames 2011 . age related changes in articular cartilage contribute to the development and progression of oa . in oa this results in senescence associated secretory phenotype which has many of the characteristics of an osteoarthritic chondrocyte in terms of the cytokines chemokines and proteases produced loeser 2011 . biomarkers have the potential to provide an early warning of joint degeneration which could prompt earlier more targeted treatment to prevent the tissue destruction that results in the characteristic chronic disability associated with oa . in this context biomarkers could make a significant contribution to the early diagnosis of oa as well as informing key aspects of disease prognosis monitoring and therapy . the national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases niams established the osteoarthritis biomarkers network to develop and validate standardized sensitive biomarker assays in blood and urine to facilitate the diagnosis of the pre radiologic stage of oa in humans and in animal models . such biomarkers could also potentially be used to identify patients at increased risk of developing oa . existing biomarkers of oa have major limitations they do not flag the pre radiographic phase of the disease they are not specific for the various stages of oa and in some cases may not even be specific for oa . considering these challenges the osteoarthritis research society international oarsi and the us food and drug administration fda have recently established a new oa biomarkers working group which has proposed the division of potential markers into two major groups the so called soluble or biomarkers which typically reflect a modulation in an endogenous substance in body fluids such blood serum plasma urine or synovial fluid and the dry biomarkers which usually consist of visual analog scales performed tasks or images of joints kraus et al . therefore the ability to detect biomarkers of cartilage degradation andor inflammation in biological samples such as serum urine or synovial fluid may enable clinicians to diagnose sub clinical oa as well as determining the disease stage in both human and companion animals . these techniques include genomics transcriptomics proteomics metabolomics glycomics and bioinformatics and can be applied to the study of cartilage synovium synovial fluid and even blood serum or urine from oa patients . studies of soluble proteins in cartilage tissue from oa patients has increased the knowledge of the proteins contained within the ecm of diseased versus normal tissue wu et al . 2008 identifying proteins released from cartilage has the potential to give an indication of disease biomarkers likely to be present in the synovial fluid or blood of patients in the early stages of oa . the discovery and validation for biomarkers of oa has accelerated significantly as our understanding of joint tissue molecules and their complex interactions have increased kraus 2005 . in particular there is a pressing need for new biomarkers that indicate early responses of the joint cartilage to degeneration that will be useful in detecting early pre radiographic changes .", " in this study icu transitional care is defined as care provided before during and after the transfer of an icu patient to another care unit with the aim of ensuring minimal disruption and optimal care for the patient . it is important that patients transfers from the icu are done properly and at the right time when there is no longer a need for intensive care 4 5 . to complete a patient s transfer from a high technological icu to a general ward many studies demonstrate the experiences of the transition but there is no clear description of the process and how it could be organized in order to be safe 511 . based on the experiences described by those involved in the process it can be argued that it is important to learn more about how to enhance and organize icu transitional care . therefore the aim of this study was to describe as experienced by intensive care and general ward staff what strategies could be used when organizing patient s care before during and after transfer from intensive care . before during and after transfer from the icu to a general ward patients experience a transition process . the specific process of transition from the icu to the general ward has become a topic of interest because difficulties that arise during the process have been increasingly frequent . as the aim of the study was to describe and illuminate the transition process between icu and general ward qualitative content analyses were considered 25 26 . could you please tell me about how the transfer process for icu patients is organized at your unit and your feelings about it clarifying questions such as what do you mean when why and can you tell me more about that were asked when necessary to encourage interviewees to narrate their experiences . the results show that the categories secure encourage and collaborate are strategies used in the three phases of the icu transitional care process before during and after transfer from the icu table 1 . the first phase in icu transitional care included secure optimizing vital signs and reducing and adjusting the intensive care encourage promoting self ability and customizing information and collaborate communicating and coordinating with the ward and arranging a pretransfer meeting . securing the patients care and preserving patient safety during icu transitional care one essential issue was to optimize the patient s vital functions prior to transfer a key component to minimize risk for adverse and readmissions which were commonly referred to in the interviews . the patient s pain relief and vital signs especially respiration and hemodynamic were the focus and a point of decision in how and when the patient could be transferred out of intensive care.the most important in the transfer process is that the patients vital signs are stable enough we observe this extremely carefully . however the icu nurses felt that they were involved and interacted with the physicians in the decision by either confirming that the patients were stable enough or postponing the transfer if the patient had respiratory issues fever or some other problematic clinical symptoms . it was also considered essential that administration of medications was altered to prepare the patients for the upcoming level of care for example shifting to sleeping pills instead of infusions prior to transfer.i think that patients that we try to wean that have been here a long time also should be used to not have full monitoring often there are enough with a pulse oximetry part of the day . encouragement based on providing repeated and customized information to patients and their families was considered by the staff to be an important tool in organizing icu transitional care . the icu and general ward staff expressed that anxiety could be minimized if patients and their families were encouraged and informed repeatedly that their condition was stabilized and that a transfer would soon occur . the staff described the coordination between the icu and the department to which the patient would be transferred as a foundation for collaboration especially when the patient had been cared for in the icu for a long time . the communication involved information about the patient needs and preparing the unit about what they should consider when the patient arrived at the ward . this made a common view for the patients planning and it was expressed as a wish for mutuality between the icu and the ward allotting responsibility and planning for the patients transfer . one icu nurse said it is important to communicate early and tell them the staff at the ward about every need that the patient may have and not cover or exclude anything . especially if the patient has been a long time in icu it is important to communicate early and tell them the staff at the ward about every need that the patient may have and not cover or exclude anything . collaborating and arranging a pretransfer meeting between ward staff and the patients and their families before transfer was expressed as one appreciated strategy . this was described as extra important when the patient or the family was anxious or if the patient had been cared for in the icu for a long time and had extended needs . the ward nurses meant that this pretransfer meeting was valuable for them and for the patient since it was an opportunity to create a contact with the patient and family before transfer . the nurses expressed that when a pretransfer meeting was organized this helped to intertwine the healthcare chain.right now for example we have a gentleman at our ward that was 4 5 months in icu he has probably a length of stay of 8 months in the hospital and before he came up we were down there and introduced us told him that we would be responsible at the ward right now for example we have a gentleman at our ward that was 4 5 months in icu he has probably a length of stay of 8 months in the hospital and before he came up we were down there and introduced us told him that we would be responsible at the ward the strategies in this phase included secure assess and summarize hand over responsibility and arrange a safe transfer encourage give confidence and collaborate negotiate and facilitate . the staff expressed that it was important prior to transfer to take time to assess and summarize the patient s discharge status and the different nursing phenomena and actions that had been or should be taken for the patient . if the transfer was not planned in advance this phase also included examining all the equipment that the patient still had and considering removing measurement and technology specific to intensive care and that were not wanted or needed at the general ward.i think it s easier when we have someone who is responsible and keeps up the documentation and prepares for discharge we really want the patient s record to be clear and that it is obvious what is planned . the staff from the general ward tried to prepare themselves by taking part of patient documents before they got to the icu but they did not always have this opportunity.i try to keep up reading about the patient before the transfer so i do nt have to start from zero knowledge . most icu patients are fragile and a safe transfer that maintains patient safety was expressed as essential . well we do nt want something critical to happen during the transfer but i will always remember one time i got to get a patient from icu i directly saw that she was hugely fragile and wondered if we really should move her from icu . that you try to focus on that this is an important positive sign that the patient has to be transferred at a ward emphasize that now is the worst of the crisis over collaboration was described by the staff as essential on the day of transfer and included negotiating a suitable time for transfer and facilitating the transfer for all involved staff members . the staff at the general ward considered it extremely important to have the opportunity to prepare when they were about to get a patient from the icu since it was often time consuming . when the patient arrived at the general ward the staff stated that it was important to get a grip of the whole situation and to take charge of the patient . the nurses expressed that it also was vital that the physician at the ward checked out the ordinations and wrote an updated status in the patient s record so that they had a tool for managing their care.its not just that the patient must be in good condition when he or she is discharged from the icu the care must also continue with high quality at the general ward . it s not just that the patient must be in good condition when he or she is discharged from the icu the care must also continue with high quality at the general ward . this team included staff from the icu nurse physician who could initiate treatment for the patient at the ward or decide to readmit the patient to the icu again . the ward nurses expressed that early mobilization in the icu was vital for how the patient s rehabilitation process proceeded . the icu and general ward staff often continued their collaboration around the patient following transfer a strategy that intertwined the icu transitional care process . sometimes a ward visit was made by the icu staff primarily not only to meet the patient again but also to give the staff an opportunity to ask questions and to give medical advice if needed . patient safety and interaction with patient family environment and other team members are essential for icu transitional care . overall the results indicate that the transition experience is dependent on preparation of both patient and families for the first contact with the team at the ward and the time of transfer therefore the planning must be taken seriously . boutilier 2007 concluded that the most important thing in the icu transitional care process was to systematically communicate the necessary information to the receiving device so that patient safety was not threatened and to ensure the necessary continuity of care . it is important to minimize experiences of a gap between the icu and general wards . the results also illustrate the importance of the team at the receiving ward having the opportunity to devote time to the patient and family when they first arrive . the results in this study showed that icu transitional care is a complex multidisciplinary process that involves collaboration both within the icu and within other units involved . effective teamwork and coordination among staff can improve the icu patient discharge process and also reduce the gap separating icu and the general ward 14 21 . one important part of icu transitional care is to promote patients self care capability and encourage patients autonomy . also important are resources time staffing and knowledge essential components in order to manage the organization of a safe transfer process from the icu to a general ward . the results were derived from data from three icus and six general wards and therefore other hospitals may have other strategies for icu transitional care that have not been described in this study . the first and second author have their own experiences as rns from both icu and general wards and their preconceptions have been bridled by thorough data analysis and discussion by being open as possible to new perspective . the results of this study conclude that secure encourage and collaborate called the sec model illustrates essential strategies suggested to use when organizing the care before during and after transfer from the icu to a general ward . a recent review described patients and families experiences about transfers from icu the themes were physical responses psychological responses information and communication safety and security and the needs of relatives all of which have been addressed in the sec model developed through this study . to ensure safe and effective care transitions strategies are needed to improve shared situational awareness teamwork patient flow and resource efficiency in icu transitional care 59 60 . the result indicates that a successful icu transitional process aims to create an interactive safe forward thinking process influenced by actions that preserve patient safety and promote individualized care . also relatives perceive safety and a continuing care as very important in the icu transitional care process and want to participate .", "  microglia are macrophage like resident immune cells in the central nervous system cns and possess both neurotoxic and neuroprotective function . microglia accumulate in the lesions of a variety of neurodegenerative disorders such as alzheimer s disease ad parkinson s disease and multiple sclerosis and are thought to play both toxic and protective functions for neuronal survival . microglia not only engulf the a protein but also phagocytose apoptotic cells and degenerated neuronal debris . degenerated neurons releases several signaling molecules including nucleotides cytokines and chemokines to recruit microglia and enhance their activities 8 9 . nucleotides are also considered as the eat me signal lately microglia expresse various p2x and p2y receptors nucleotide receptors which regulate not only chemotaxis but also phagocytosis 8 12 . microglia express many other surface receptors which have direct interaction with the target to initiate phagocytosis including ps receptor lipopolysaccharide lps receptor cd14 the scavenger receptor cd36 the purine receptor p2y6 and the toll like receptors tlrs table 1 figure 1 . as shown in figure 2 we previously reported that interleukin34 il34 a newly discovered cytokine is produced by neurons and that its receptor colony stimulating factor 1 receptor is primarily expressed on microglia . in the following sections we will discuss about recent advances of microglial chemotaxis and phagocytosis and their implications for ad therapy . microglia constitutively express several chemokine receptors table 1 which are implicated in the recruitment and accumulation microglia in ad lesions . when exposed to a microglia are induced to produce several chemokines such as ccl2 ccl4 and cxcl12 . however there is a conflicting report showing increased tgf signaling in microglia surrounding a plaques in ccr2 knockout in ad model mouse appswe ps1ccr2 . cx3cl1 directly induces various microglial functions including migration proliferation inhibition of fas ligand induced cell death and glutamate induced neurotoxicity 45 46 and inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine production 42 47 . recently we have shown that soluble form of cx3cl1 also directly enhances microglial clearance of degenerated neuronal debris which is mediated through phosphatidylserine ps receptor and production of milk fat globule egf factor 8 protein mfg e8 figure 2 . therefore these cx3cl1shedding proteases may regulate the microglial phagocytosis directly or indirectly through cx3cl1 expression and may also play a role on pathogenesis of ad . microglia also express many other phagocytosis related receptors which are not yet unclear to the correlation of inflammatory status . cr3microglia express classical phagocytosis related receptor the m 2 integrin complement receptor3 cr3 mac1 cd11b cd18 and scavenger receptor srai ii sr ai ii cd204 . microglia express classical phagocytosis related receptor the m 2 integrin complement receptor3 cr3 mac1 cd11b cd18 and scavenger receptor srai ii sr ai ii cd204 . cd14cd14 is the lps receptor which is also considered as classical phagocytosis related receptor in macrophage and microglia . cd14 is the lps receptor which is also considered as classical phagocytosis related receptor in macrophage and microglia . cd36 and cd47a directly interacted with microglial cell surface receptor complex comprising the class b scavenger receptor cd36 6 1 integrin and integrin

production . among the tlrs lps receptor tlr4 potently activates microglia in various aspects such as a phagocytosis and proinflammatory molecules production 98 99 . the response of microglia to fibrillar a is mediated via cd14 which act together with tlr4 and tlr2 to bind fibrillar a and induced microglial activation through p38 mapk . a triggers the inflammatory status in microglia via heterodimer of tlr4 and tlr6 which is regulated by cd36 . recently we have shown that cx3cl1 induces mfg e8 expression in primary mouse microglia to lead to the microglial clearance of degenerated neuronal debris . others also reported the induction of mfg e8 by cx3cl1 in macrophages and rat microglia 109 110 . microglia express a wide array of receptors characteristic to immune cell such as cd molecules integrins chemokine receptors and psr figure 1 . therefore if the other phagocytosis related receptors including tlrs interact with psr microglia would be activated to outbreak excessive phagocytosis with robust inflammation . microglia from old app ps1 mouse but not from younger ones show the reduction of sra cd36 rage and the adegrading enzymes including insulysin neprilysin and

high risk environment for sexually transmitted hiv . themes that emerged and that promoted power imbalances in sexual relationships were lack of trust in women disempowerment and biological determinism . the predominant ideal male identity was conceptualised in one word the player characterised by two symbols of status wealth and women . having multiple often young female sexual partners further enhanced men s social position and women served as a marker of both sexual and financial power.i can make an example about me because i have about eight girlfriends . seemingly women responded to these strategies and aided in the socialisation of men s sexual identities with new gender power dynamics contrary to many of the previous norms in traditional initiation schools . furthermore strong peer pressure to have many concurrent young sexual partners played an important part in the creation of the masculine ideal within male social groups manifesting in large sexual networks.i will take a lot of pressure from the boys . it would seem that the masculinity norms that have evolved in the study context are making use of new symbols to express power that facilitate the redefinition of men in relation to other men thereby reinforcing risky sexual behaviours . to explore forms of identities underlying and associated reasons on different levels are needed to further explain why certain types of masculinity evolve . the construction of the player not only involved the manifestation of material wealth and multiple girlfriends but also offered a set of underlying reasons for gender related power structures . by assessing women s behaviour and what was perceived as unacceptable men automatically felt that they had certain rights which further legitimised a negative power play between men and women . applying restrictive social norms to certain female behaviours was not the only way to define men s masculinity and to promote power imbalances . the fact that women often challenged predominant gender stereotypes by engaging in what was perceived to be normative male sexual behaviour was used as an excuse for degrading attitudes and behaviours towards women . this underlying distress and insecurity among these men can be seen as a sign of a situation where the traditional hegemonic masculinity is contested allowing new forms to evolve to maintain a certain power imbalance . the urban context characterised by lack of money and men s self perceived disempowerment in relation to women and society in general created a situation where manhood was constantly questioned . this interpretation of women as active agents in relationships created a deeply rooted insecurity among men that alienated them from women . the commonly expressed negative perceptions of women were thus multilayered and reflected an intricate power play that included lack of control and distrust towards women.according to me they can not keep one partner anymore because they do nt trust that is why they are going around.they are also players because the thing is unemployment rate if that can be organized to get jobs maybe they can start their lives themselves . men s distrust and a perceived disempowerment in relation to women supported the formation of large sexual networks characterised by unequal power dynamics . having multiple often young female sexual partners

and a perceived disempowerment in relation to women supported the formation of large sexual networks characterised by unequal power dynamics . strong social pressure within male core groups to pursue and maintain these concurrent sexual relationships and temporary sexual encounters existed and helped legitimise specific behaviours that the player represented . our findings thus support previous research showing that dominant masculinities can be characterised by large sexual networks as a means to express manhood and as a response to societal changes unemployment and poverty low self esteem and perceived disempowerment 27 . the representation of a man and his associated attributes has evolved and been re shaped into new sets of meanings where traditional social expectations of conservative restrained sexuality have largely changed . in this particular context the ways in which manhood is defined has clearly put men and women at increased risk for sexually transmitted hiv as these gender structures profoundly influence men s sexual identity and how sexuality is used to manifest power not least between men themselves . an urban and modern way of sexual socialisation that incorporates an ideal masculinity as the player poses a clear risk that needs to be addressed . although findings might only be representative of this group of men we believe that this unique opportunity to reach men in this harsh urban setting provides important new knowledge on how contemporary masculine ideals affect gender dynamics that need to be addressed in hiv prevention .", " in the previous issue of critical care chase and coworkers reported on their implementation into clinical practice and evaluation of the specialized relative insulin nutrition table sprint . it is also uncertain whether the results of the ongoing multicentre open label randomized controlled trial nice sugar of the effects of blood glucose management on 90day all cause mortality in a heterogeneous population of intensive care unit icu patients will resolve remaining concerns about tgc in the icu . nevertheless there is a clear need to introduce efficient tools that will help clinicians and nursing staff to control blood glucose levels in icu patients because hyperglycaemia superior to 10 mmol studies are required to provide clinicians with recommendations on the evaluation and comparison of the various protocols currently in use or that are soon to become available . furthermore the best way to compare performance is controversial is it the time with glucose within a common target range the hyperglycaemia index the recently described glycaemic penalty index or the variability that would be associated with outcome this raises the question of whether the efficacy results from instructions regarding nutritional intake allowing insulin infusion rates to be limited to a level lower than usual or from the intrinsic quality of the algorithm used which is based on the glucose insulin regulatory system model capturing insulin utilization rate insulin losses and saturation dynamics .", " considering the role of host itgb6 receptor gene the aim of the present study was to screen genetic variation within a snp rs136500299 at exon 14 region among different indigenous cattle . in this study we describe an accurate method on the basis of competitive polymerase chain reaction pcr so called tetraplex arms pcr for identification of the snp among different animals . the method employs four primers to amplify a fragment from dna containing the snp and amplicons representing each of the two allelic forms . primers can be designed to amplify fragments of differing sizes for each allele band in order for them to be easily resolved using agarose gel electrophoresis . details of the primer used for the present study and the amplicon size for different genotypes were shown in table 1 . pcr was performed in a total volume of 25 l containing approximately 50 ng dna 2.5 l of 10x buffer 2.0 mm mgcl2 0.2 mm dntps 5 pmol of each outer primers 10 pmol of each inner primers and 1 u of taq polymerase sigma aldrich usa . validation of the three different genotypes was analyzed by cloning and sequencing the 433 bp pcr products for each genotype . the present study was aimed to develop a single tube tetraplex pcr based genotyping assay for snp rs13650029 at exonic region of bovine itgb6 receptor gene . snp genotyping techniques depend on amplification of the target dna using pcr technique but differ in the means of discerning between the different alleles which involves significant post amplification manipulations . another extensively used snp typing technique allele specific oligonucleotide aso melting involves lengthy blotting and hybridization techniques . the method described in the present study is a simple swift and cost effective method for snp genotyping in large number of individuals ye et al .", " currently hd research is conducted in rodent models rodent primary neurons and non neural human cell lines but there are questions as to whether such systems yield findings that are truly relevant to the mechanistic basis of human hd pathogenesis . respectively reported the generation and characterization of ipsc derived models for hd and the genetic correction of a disease causing cag repeat expansion mutation in ipscs from individuals with hd . as generation and characterization of ipsc lines can be laborious and costly one obvious solution to assure the validity of ipsc disease models is to create research teams that work together on a particular disorder sharing ipsc lines and derived neurons . this very strategy was applied in the hd ipsc consortium study in which eight different groups produced ipscs from three individuals with hd and three control individuals and used them to assay a wide range of phenotypes . this study also demonstrated that the genetically corrected hd ipsc line could be used to produce nscs using a protocol described previously by this group . both groups performed gene expression analysis to compare hd ipscs and their neuronal derivatives . the hd ipsc consortium findings implicated genes that are involved in cell signaling cell cycling axon guidance and neuronal development as dysregulated in nscs figure 1 . hd ipscs corrected ipscs and ipsc derived neurons reveal key disease associated phenotypes . these npcs yielded evidence for the altered expression in hd of genes that are involved in cell signaling cell cycling axon guidance and neurodevelopmental pathways . the hd ipsc consortium reported decreased intracellular atp levels in hd neural progenitor cells npcs and an et al . the hd ipsc consortium used a variety of assays including longitudinal survival tracking nuclear condensation assays and caspase 37 activation to detect increased cell death in hd nscs and striatal like derivatives . have taken an initial step toward the application of corrected hd ipsc derived neurons in cell replacement therapy . validation of the role of pgc1 and tfeb dysfunction in hd ipsc models would be worthwhile and could facilitate the development of new therapies . as hd patients with longer cag repeats suffer more widespread neuron cell death it will be important to determine if the vulnerability of ipsc derived neurons differs between neural cell types figure 1 .", " the medical questionnaire revealed no signs of urinary tract infection prostatitis urethritis or cystitis and the patient stated that he did not had any recent physical contact with persons who had acute zikv infection . we tested blood and semen rna extracts using real time reverse transcription pcr rrt pcr as described using 2 primers probe amplification sets specific for zikv 3 . the rrt pcr results were positive for zikv in semen and negative in blood and confirmed by sequencing of the genomic position 8581138 encompassing the prm e protein coding regions of zikv . rrt pcr detected zikv rna in the semen and urine but not in the blood sample . replicative zikv particles were found in the 2 semen samples but none were detected in the urine sample . zikv infection of the patient and his wife was confirmed by serologic testing but the presence of zikv in the semen of the patient was not investigated . we detected a high zikv rna load and replicative zikv in semen samples but zikv remained undetectable by rrt pcr in the blood sample collected at the same time . furthermore the observation that zikv rna was detectable in urine after viremia clearance in blood suggests that as found for denv and wnv infections urine samples can yield evidence ofzikv for late diagnosis but more investigation is needed .", " moreover there is strong evidence indicating that changes in the intestinal microbiota and their function could be one of the contributing factors in the development of ibs . several studies have reported differences in the intestinal microbiota composition of ibs patients and healthy controls however the results show little overlap from study to study . regardless of the lack of coherent changes in the microbial composition there is clear evidence for the role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of ibs . in our recent study by jalanka and colleagues the differences in the microbial composition of pi ibs patients were addressed by analyzing the faecal microbiota of the study subjects with a previously validated and benchmarked phylogenetic microarray detecting the abundance of over 1000 bacterial phylotypes found in the human intestine . our aim was to determine the microbial compositional differences and to address associations between the faecal microbiota and the clinical features of ibs from patients with a varying degree of symptoms . as the development of ibs is multifactorial we hypothesized that the observed symptoms and development of pi ibs may arise from the interplay between the faecal microbiota the host immune response and psychological factors . this integrated approach addressing the associations between clinical phenotype and the faecal microbiota allowed us to address the complex relationships between the host and microbiota in the pathogenesis of ibs and pi ibs . moreover we found that the microbial profile of the pi ibs and pi bd groups resembled those suffering from ibs d . our results corroborate the previous reports that the microbial composition could be used to further stratify ibs patients and thus complement the clinical subgroupings . to verify our findings in a larger patient material we combined the microbiota data form the british subjects with that of a swedish pi ibs cohort reported recently by sundin and colleagues . the combined data aimed to determine whether the pi ibs patients from 2 countries share similarities in their microbiota compared to healthy controls . remarkably the significant difference in the microbiota profiles between the healthy and pi ibs patients was replicated p 0.05 fig . figure 1.intestinal microbiota of pi ibs patients is significantly different form that of healthy controls hc . intestinal microbiota of pi ibs patients is significantly different form that of healthy controls hc . in the pathophysiology of ibs is controversial probably reflecting the heterogeneity of the patients as well as the genus bacteroides . previous studies have reported opposing results regarding the relevance of bacteroides genera in ibs as there is evidence for both increased as well as decreased abundance in the patients . altogether these data from several studies allow to hypothesize that the subjects with a microbial profile resembling the imd could be more susceptible for contracting a gastrointestinal infection and later developing pi ibs . the results led us to hypothesize that both the physical and immunological gut barrier of subjects with an ibs type microbiota has been compromised resulting in a low grade inflammation a feature of some ibs patients . this is in line with previous findings and of great significance as it allows proposing a model in which some subjects with a relatively healthy microbiota report ibs symptoms while others with a microbiota resembling that of the ibs patients have no complaints as they have compensating factors that overcome the microbial component and hence are scored healthy fig . the pi ibs patients can be stratified according to the imd or more generally the microbial composition to those with ibs like microbiota red and those with a composition resembling healthy individuals turquoise . recently similar bacterial signatures have been also detected in subjects prior to gastroenteritis suggesting that perhaps the microbial composition already at the time of the initial infection predisposes certain subjects for pi ibs . 2 built on microbiota based patient stratification will not only give insight into the observed microbiota heterogeneity among ibs patients as well as its partial overlap with healthy controls but also represents a concrete step toward improved diagnostics and novel treatment options with improved efficacy .", "

their associated sinus borden type iii which prevents transvenous access261011 . huang et al.6 reported complete cure of tentorial davf in 78.6 1114 by transarterial embolization using onyx . hwang et al.7 and lawton et al.10 recommended surgical option for incomplete embolization of tentorial davf by simple interruption of draining vein . the surgical interruption of proximal venous drain could be considered according to types of tentorial davf by location and drain vein . case 1 was torcular type by lasjaunias et al.9 and lawton et al.10 and then marginal tentorial sinus group by picard et al.12 which was located around tocular area and drained to supratentorial cotical vein into basal vein of rosenthal and causes brain stem hemorrhage . tentorial davf should be treated aggressively and transarterial embolization with onyx can be prior option when transvenous access is difficult . if partially treated tentorial davf by embolization procedure simple surgical interruption of proximal

occur due to traction on the ru fistula that is indirect traction on the urethra during separation and closure of fistula . urethral stenosis can be avoided by applying less traction on the fistula during separation and avoiding the closure of fistula we have seen in our series that urethral stenosis was not seen in any of the cases of group a where the ru fistula was not closed . urethral stenosis due to ligation or closure of the ru fistula may result in recurrent epididymo orchitis . by avoiding the closure of the ru fistula we can avoid excessive traction on the fistula and hence on the urethra and also prevent the excessive dissection during fistula closure and minimize the chance of neurogenic dysfunction .", " keratinocytes of middle ear cholesteatoma were cultured by tissue

methods have been found useful in enhanced sampling and free energy calculation of the biomolecules . during the simulations a potential or force bias is applied along certain reaction coordinates or collective variables to facilitate the biomolecular conformational transitions across high energy barriers . accelerated molecular dynamics amd is an enhanced sampling technique that works often by adding a non negative boost potential to smoothen the biomolecular potential energy surface . with this amd is able to sample distinct biomolecular conformations and rare barrier crossing events that are not accessible to conventional md cmd simulations . unlike the previously mentioned biasing simulation methods amd does not require predefined reaction coordinates which can be advantageous for exploring the biomolecular conformational space without a priori knowledge or restraints . it has been a long standing problem to accurately reweight amd simulations and recover the original free energy landscapes especially for large proteins . the reweighted free energy profiles are in good agreement with the long time scale cmd simulations as demonstrated on alanine dipeptide and fast folding proteins . in simulations of larger systems the boost potential exhibits significantly wider distribution and a gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics gamd approach is presented to reduce the energetic noise for simultaneous unstrained enhanced sampling and free energy calculation of biomolecules even for large proteins . gamd makes use of harmonic functions to construct the boost potential that is adaptively added to the biomolecular potential energy surface . in this study gamd is demonstrated on unconstrained simulations of the alanine dipeptide chignolin folding and ligand binding to the t4lysozyme . with greater k0 higher boost potential is added to the original energy surface in conventional molecular dynamics cmd which provides enhanced sampling of biomolecules across decreased energy barriers . as demonstrated on the alanine dipeptide chignolin and t4lysozyme in this study a gaussian distribution of the boost potential is normally achieved in the gamd simulations . long time dual boost gamd simulations were then obtained for analysis including three independent 30 ns simulations of alanine dipeptide and three independent 300 ns simulations of chignolin . complete binding of benzene to the target ligand binding site was observed in one of the five simulations . furthermore the boost potential applied in the present gamd simulations follows gaussian distribution which allows accurate reweighting using cumulant expansion to the second order and recovery of the original biomolecular free energy landscapes even for proteins as large as the t4lysozyme . notably hundreds of nanoseconds gamd simulations are able to capture complete folding of chignolin and ligand binding of benzene to the t4lysozyme that take place on significantly longer time scales . therefore 0p0d were set to 3.0 3.0 for the production dual boost gamd simulations of alanine dipeptide which enables the highest acceleration as well as accurate reweighting with both k0p and k0d equal to 1.0 supporting information table s1c . as shown in figure 2b the boost potential v applied in gamd simulation of the alanine dipeptide follows gaussian distribution . using the protein rmsd relative to the pdb native structure and rg a 2d pmf profile was calculated by reweighting the three 300 ns gamd simulations combined figure 3c . short testing gamd simulations of the t4lysozyme showed that k0p reached the 1.0 maximum for the highest total potential boost when 0p was increased to 3.0 supporting information table s3a . with further testing for stable dual boost gamd simulation 0p0d were set to 3.0 4.0 for the final production simulations of the t4lysozyme supporting information table s3c . gamd captured complete binding of benzene to the deeply buried ligand binding cavity in the leu99ala t4lysozyme within 100 ns in one of the five independent 800 ns simulations supporting information movie s2 . using the rmsd of benzene relative to the bound pose and the number of protein heavy atoms that are within 5 of benzene ncontact a 2d pmf profile was calculated by reweighting the 1800 ns gamd simulation figure 5c . it is important to note that since the complete binding of benzene to the target ligand binding site was observed only once the calculated binding free energy between the bound and unbound states is subject to the error of limited sampling . nevertheless benzene visits the intermediate site many times during the 1800 ns gamd simulation with the ligand rmsd decreased to 11 supporting information figure s2a . binding of benzene to the leu99ala t4lysozyme simulated via gamd a comparison of simulation derived complex structure that captures benzene binding blue with 0.1 ligand rmsd relative to the 181l pdb structure red b distribution of the boost potential v c 2d ligand rmsd ncontact pmf calculated by reweighting the 1800 ns gamd simulation and d distribution anharmonicity of v of frames found in each bin of the free energy profile . a complete binding pathway of benzene that was observed in the gamd simulation is shown in figure 6a . by adaptively adding a harmonic boost potential to smoothen the system energy surface gamd provides both unconstrained enhanced sampling and free energy calculation of biomolecules . in one of the five independent simulations benzene diffused into the deeply buried ligand binding cavity within 100 ns and remained bound even when similar to chignolin while k0p can be increased to the 1.0 maximum for the greatest total potential boost in the t4lysozyme simulations k0d can reach only 0.330.35 for the greatest dihedral boost . the atomistic gamd simulation also elucidates a highly detailed binding pathway of benzene that diffuses from the bulk solvent to an intermediate site located on the protein surface formed by the d and g helices and then slides into the target ligand binding cavity through a channel formed by the d f and g helices . the free energy difference between the intermediate and unbound states was found to be small at 0.53 0.46 kcal mol as estimated from the five independent gamd simulations . it is important to note that the complete ligand binding was not observed in the four 800 ns gamd simulations suggesting that the present gamd simulations still suffer from insufficient sampling of the ligand entry process and the reweighted free energy profiles remain unconverged figure 5c and supporting information figure s5 . supporting information table s4 summarizes the statistical properties of the boost potential and the original and modified potential energies as obtained from amd and gamd simulations of the alanine dipeptide chignolin and t4lysozyme with reference to the cmd simulations . for the t4lysozyme restarting from the initial configuration of gamd simulations a 200 ns dual boost amd simulation was performed using the following acceleration parameters edihed vdihedav 4nres dihed 4nres5 etotal vtotalav 0.2natoms and total 0.2natoms where vdihedav and vtotalav are the average dihedral and total potential energies calculated from a short 10 ns cmd simulation . narrower distribution in the gamd simulations except for the alanine dipeptide . notably for the t4lysozyme standard deviations of the modified potential energies are significantly smaller in the gamd simulations than in amd . thus the potential energy surfaces appear more smoothened in gamd enhanced sampling of the t4lysozyme . provided the narrower distribution and lower anharmonicity of the boost potential supporting information table s4 gamd allows for more accurate approximation of exponential average reweighting factor using cumulant expansion to the second order and thus improved free energy calculation especially for the t4lysozyme . in the present simulations of ligand binding to the t4lysozyme complete binding of benzene was observed only once largely because the target ligand binding site is deeply buried in the protein . however benzene binding to the intermediate site on the protein surface formed by the d and g helices was captured many times which provides better statistics for free energy calculation . it has been suggested that a pmf based approach is appropriate to calculate binding free energy for ligands especially the charged that bind to the protein surface . in comparison with many enhanced sampling methods such as umbrella sampling conformational flooding metadynamics abf calculations and orthogonal space sampling gamd has the advantage of no need to set predefined reaction coordinates . metadynamics in particular is another potential biasing technique that has been widely used to map the free energy landscapes of biomolecules such as protein conformational changes and protein ligand binding . by monitoring the energy surface of biomolecules during the simulation metadynamics keeps adding small gaussians of potential energies to the low energy regions . the usage of predefined coordinates greatly reduces the complexity of biomolecular simulation problems and facilitates the free energy calculations e.g. in comparison amd simulations are not constrained by reaction coordinates but this also leads to much higher energetic noise and presents grand challenge for accurate reweighting to recover the original free energy landscapes of biomolecules . here by constructing boost potential using a harmonic function that follows gaussian distribution gamd enables rigorous energetic reweighting through cumulant expansion to the second order even for simulations of larger proteins e.g. this is particularly true for the ligand entry step in the gamd simulation of benzene binding to the t4lysozyme . in summary without the need to set predefined reaction coordinates gamd is generally applicable to a wide range of biomolecular systems as demonstrated on protein folding and ligand binding in this study . therefore gamd provides both unconstrained enhanced sampling and free energy calculation for biomolecular simulations .", " angiography performed on admission revealed near complete occlusion of the suprabulbar portion of the

location 3 but the technique for the preservation of the artery is technically demanding and time consuming . the advent of stenting techniques in carotid artery angioplasty has however led to their exploitation in the preservation of arterial patency . various stents can be used for the restoration of luminal patency and occlusion of the sac of a dissecting aneurysm some authors have insisted that a covered stent is especially useful 11 though stents without fabric covering have also been used for the same purpose with successful results as in our cases . for suprabulbar internal carotid artery dissection we applied a self expandable stent and for subpetrosal internal carotid artery dissection the balloon expandable type in both cases the results were successful . during the management of case 1 we delayed stent placement because of an infarction in the patient s right middle cerebral artery territory due to embolic occlusion . because flow through the patent anterior communication artery was good management could have involved occlusion of the dissected ica because of the relative ease and safety of the endovascular recanalization methods now available however a destructive method of this kind was not considered . angiography appeared to indicate that this was narrow enough to cause a watershed infarction due to hemodynamic insufficiency and that stenting of the stenotic segment could recanalize the stenosis as well as seal the aneurysmal sac . suggesting that the dissection had opened in such cases endovascular stent placement is a safe and effective method for the management of patients with extracranial carotid artery dissections with or without associated aneurysm .", "", "", " we discuss whether autologous melanocyte transplantation is an

1.5 and 3.5 mm . retinal surface contour variability the diagnostic accuracy of nfl and rscv were assessed using aroc values at each sampling radius table 3 . 6 showed that rscv had higher sensitivity for glaucoma diagnosis 53 than nflt 29 . the correlations between averaged rscv and nflt or between averaged rscv and vf md were estimated for glaucomatous participants . the reproducibility cv was

groups . the rscv measured in the peripapillary area was significantly larger in glaucoma eyes . because the rscv measures small scale focal changes that are unlikely to be due to the inborn variation of nflt it may be able to better detect glaucoma in the earlier stages when nfl damage is small and variable in the location . in this study nflt was abnormally 99 specificity cutoff thin in only 5 of 17 participants in the glaucoma group while rscv was abnormally elevated in 9 of 17 glaucoma participants . thus the inner retinal surface is smoother and rscv is lower further from the disc . thus maximizing the oct scan density in the 2.5 to 3.5mm radius annulus around the optic disc may improve rscv evaluation . between the scan radii of 2.5 to 3.5 mm the mean rscv values varied less than 2 in the normal and glaucoma groups . in previous studies contour variability was accessed by heidelberg retinal tomography hrt but was considerably inferior in its ability to diagnose glaucoma or progression compared to nfl measured by oct . a power calculation shows that our sample size of 17 normal and 17 glaucoma subjects should be able to detect a difference in aroc of 0.67 compared to the aroc of rscv of 0.90 with a probability of 0.80 at a significance threshold of p 0.05 . we also tested the correlation between ssi and rscv but did not find any significance for the normal and

pancreas which was proposed in 2001 by hruban et al . panin is assumed to be a precursor lesion of invasive ductal carcinoma idc . thus it is hypothesized that pancreatic ductal lesions may progress from a histologically normal duct through flat lesion panin1a papillary lesion panin1b atypical lesion panin2 to severely atypical lesion panin3 . however the histological evidence that panin3 invades beyond the basement membrane of pancreatic ductal epithelium that is the moment panin3 becomes idc has not been captured yet . panin3 obstructed several branch pancreatic ducts and subsequently caused pancreatitis which developed clinical symptom and was detectable as a pancreatic mass on imaging studies . panin3 has been reported to share some genetic alterations with idc 6 7 8 9 and to be found usually in the pancreas with idc 2 3 4 5 . this is the first case report in which microinvasion of panin3 was histologically confirmed in the resected pancreatic specimens . according to the revised definitions panin is a microscopic papillary or flat epithelial neoplasm arising in the pancreatic duct and differs from ipmn which is defined as a grossly visible mucin producing predominantly papillary epithelial neoplasm . this fact indicates that panin does not arise from one small portion of pancreatic ductal epithelium and spread creeping along the epithelia but arises multicentric . as the whole pancreas may be involved in the genetic alteration which is related to carcinogenesis it is not difficult to understand that panin occurs independently in different sites of the pancreas . in this case panin3 was successfully detected due to pancreatitis caused by the intraductal growth of panin3 and subsequent occlusion of the pancreatic ducts .", " ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate was first reported by melicow and pachter in 1967 as an endometrial carcinoma prostatic utricle . since then ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate has been found to account for 0.27.5 of all prostate carcinomas . recent studies have suggested that ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate developed from the ductal epithelium based on findings from immunohistochemical and electron microscope analyses . in this case although the prostate needle biopsy showed acinar adenocarcinoma the surgical specimens showed ductal adenocarcinoma . the first is a mixed type with acinar adenocarcinoma and accounts for 75 of ductal prostate specimens . reported that ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate showed a significantly poorer prognosis than acinar prostate adenocarcinoma in nonmetastatic cases .", " although bevacizumab can offer a significantly higher response rate of 55 and a period of clinical stabilization with a median ttp of 26 weeks the tumor remains in the brain and continues to proliferate despite clinical and radiological appearances of improvement . here we report a patient who had failed bevacizumab therapy for a recurrent cystic glioblastoma and at the time of bevacizumab continuation received add on ttfields therapy by using the novottf100a device . the patient is a 76year old right handed woman who came to the brain tumor center for an evaluation of her recurrent glioblastoma after bevacizumab failure . after 2 cycles of bevacizumab there was only a partial decrease in the gadolinium enhancement and the size of the cystic tumor fig . because ttfields interrupt tumor cells during mitosis and have no appreciable overlapping toxicity with bevacizumab we proceeded to add to her bevacizumab treatment ttfields therapy using the novottf100a device . after a total of 6 cycles of bevacizumab plus ttfields therapy with a respective mean and median compliance of 17.6 hours 73 of the day and 18.4 hours 77 of the day range 3.6 to 22.8 h there was a near complete resolution of gadolinium enhancement and a 65 reduction in the size of the cystic tumor fig . third both bevacizumab and novottf100a are listed in the national comprehensive cancer network practice guideline for recurrent glioblastoma . therefore there appear to be strong rationales to combine novottf100a with bevacizumab for recurrent glioblastoma . these data indicate that bevacizumab alone rarely results in a complete radiographic response and the partial response seen in a majority of patients suggests that there are probably multiple proangiogenic pathways activated in the glioblastoma . a prior post hoc analysis of the response characteristics from the pivotal phase iii trial indicates that secondary glioblastomas as well as low or no dexamethasone usage are potentially important predictors of response in patients treated with the novottf100a device alone 7 17 . second the slower growth rate of our patient s tumor may have helped to allow sufficient time for the ttfields to effect a treatment response . last our patient s dexamethasone was completely discontinued 2 months after initiation of combination ttfields and bevacizumab therapy but a near complete resolution of gadolinium enhancement and a significant reduction of the cystic tumor were not detectable until 6 months into treatment .", " to the present date there is no reported controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of a dentifrice containing aloe vera in the control of plaque and gingivitis . therefore the purpose of the present study was to assess the antiplaque and antigingivitis effects of this phytotherapic agent compared to a fluoridated dentifrice . subjects with medical disorders or probing depth 3 mm individuals under antimicrobial therapy at least 1 month prior to the study and using mouthrinses or dentifrices containing substances with antiinflammatory properties as well as smokers and pregnant women were excluded from the trial . the test group used a herbal dentifrice containing aloe vera forever bright forever living products tempe az usa and the control group used a fluoridated dentifrice sorriso dentes brancos kolynos do brasil so paulo sp brazil with no antiinflammatory properties but with color and taste similar to those of the test dentifrice . to the best of our knowledge the present study is the first report about effect of a dentifrice containing aloe vera on gingivitis . it is interesting to note that this previous study7 evaluated a dentifrice that also contained other antiplaque agents which probably masked the effect of aloe vera . the test and control dentifrices reduced gingivitis significantly although the fluoridated dentifrice presented a higher percent reduction on bleeding areas 56 versus 53 . studies evaluating the reduction of gingivitis by a grading index could be interesting to complement these results . the findings of the present study are in agreement with those of villalobos et al.20 2001 who observed a significant reduction on plaque and gingivitis after a 30day use of mouthrinses containing aloe vera associated to toothbrushing . this fact has been highlighted by wua and savitt21 2002 and confirmed by other clinical trials comparing fluoridated and herbal dentifrices1115 . home use dentifrice studies are often influenced by a number of factors which can mask the superiority of a test agent over the controls . further long term studies must be performed to evaluate the antigingivitis effect of this herbal dentifrice . within the limits of this clinical study it may be concluded that the dentifrice containing aloe vera did not show any additional effect on plaque and gingivitis control compared to the fluoridated dentifrice .", " microscopically the sections

the breast . mucinous carcinoma rarely originates in the skin the majority of examples in the skin are actually metastatic to it . metastatic lesions from the breast or colon are most likely to mimic mucinous carcinoma of the skin . due to the difficulty in distinguishing these histologically a thorough workup for metastatic lesions no primary tumor was detected in the breast digestive tract salivary glands lacrimal glands paranasal sinuses lungs or kidneys . primary mucinous carcinoma of the skin is a slow growing benign tumor with a high local recurrence rate .", " this has led to an increase in biopsy of small renal masses a proportion of which needle biopsy of small renal masses is controversial owing to the risk of seeding malignant cells along the needle tract . needle tract seeding is a rare event the incidence is estimated to be less than 1 in 10000 cases of all biopsies . eight other cases of needle tract seeding in a renal mass biopsy have been described in the medical literature two as recently as 2013 table 1 . biopsy tract seeding has been reported in renal mass biopsies using needles as fine as 23gauge and as large as 14gauge . although it is interesting to note that a coaxial needle was not used in any of the currently reported cases of needle tract seeding after renal mass biopsy table 1 there are just too few cases to establish a firm relationship between the risk of biopsy tract seeding and the use of a coaxial needle . in conclusion a common feature in all reported cases of needle tract seeding from a renal mass biopsy is that a coaxial needle was not used .", " despite its ubiquity in cell membranes there is little quantitative information on the effects of small mole fractions of cholesterol on the phase diagrams molecular organization and surface viscosity of mixtures of phospholipids and cholesterol . understanding cholesterol s effects in altering the local molecular organization and rheology of lipid monolayers may give clues to the mechanisms that stabilize nanometer scale rafts in complex lipid cholesterol mixtures the raft hypothesis has emerged in recent years as a general organizing principle for the structure of eukaryotic cell membranes . rafts are hypothesized to result from nanometer scale phase separation of ordered and viscous domains in which cholesterol saturated lipids and membrane proteins preferentially accumulate surrounded by a sea of less viscous unsaturated lipids with greater protein diffusivity . however the fundamental physics underlying raft formation is still being developed especially how interactions between saturated phospholipids and cholesterol determine membrane phase behavior viscosity and diffusivity . our previous work has shown that the surface viscosity of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine dppc monolayers decreases by an order of magnitude per wt cholesterol up to about 3 wt suggesting that the cholesterol containing infasurf would have significantly different monolayer dynamics than cholesterol free survanta and curosurf . grazing incidence x ray diffraction gixd shows that up to 7 mol added cholesterol does not change the basic alkane packing of dppc but does decrease the extent of ordering or coherence area suggesting an increased number of lattice defects . this suggests that the decreased molecular ordering caused by the incompatibility of cholesterol with the alkane chain lattice is the origin of the orders of magnitude decrease in surface viscosity . it is well established that the bragg peaks correspond to ordering within the alkane chains of the lipid tailgroups the organization of the headgroups is inferred from changes in the tailgroup lattice in response to changes in surface pressure and cholesterol fraction . cholesterol broadens both peaks consistent with a decrease in the size of the correlated areas in the monolayer . cholesterol and surface pressure influence the lattice in a similar way the same linear relationship between d11 and the tilt angle holds over the range of surface pressures and cholesterol fractions examined figure 4 . decreases with increasing surface pressure and with some scatter increasing cholesterol fraction from 35 for pure dppc at 20 mn m to 18 for 7 mol chol at 40 mn m . this change in tilt causes a decrease in the area per dppc molecule at the air water interface from 49.9 1 to 43.9 1 . molecular tilt angle measured from the monolayer normal decreases in the same manner with increasing cholesterol fraction as with increasing surface pressure over this range of sin tilt tilt to convert to degrees of tilt 180tilt . this linear relationship between d11 and is the same for changes in cholesterol fraction and surface pressure which suggests that the local alkane packing of dppc does not change with added cholesterol but that both surface pressure and cholesterol act to decrease the mismatch between the lipid headgroup and tailgroup area in the same way . as is the case for other lipids accommodation of the larger dppc headgroup area occurs by dilation of the alkane chain area via an increase in the tilt angle . the area per alkane chain perpendicular to the alkane chains 20.5 0.3 ab cos 2 is constant within the experimental error for all surface pressures and also for all cholesterol fractions . the invariance of d02 or b and the linear relationship between d11 and is consistent with the bulk of the chol not intercalating uniformly into the dppc lattice as it does at higher mole fractions but separating primarily into a second phase . fluorescence images of dppc monolayers with 0.0 0.2 and 0.4 mol cholesterol at coexistence between the disordered le light and ordered lc dark phases at 10 mn m . the domain width decreases with increasing cholesterol indicative of a decrease in line tension . the combination of the sterol rings of chol and more disordered dppc chains gives the nanodomain phase excess tailgroup area which may relieve part of the packing frustration of the headgroups in the adjacent ordered dppc domains albeit at longer range than if the cholesterol intercalated within the dppc lattice . fluorescence images figure 6 at the coexistence surface pressure 910 mn m show that increasing chol leads to a dramatic decrease in the width of the domains which means a large decrease in . at 40 mn m l02 does not monotonically decrease with cholesterol fraction the scatter in l02 is much greater than at lower surface pressures and l02 is always less than expected from the results for the lower surface pressures . the afm images in figure 5 show that the average dppc light gray domain size decreases from microns to 100200 nm with cholesterol . b the surface viscosity of dppc chol monolayers measured with a microbutton magnetic rheometer decreases exponentially with cholesterol fraction for a given surface pressure for small mole fractions of cholesterol then plateaus in the same fashion as l02 . c free area model for dppc chol monolayers eqs 6 8 provides an excellent correlation between the surface viscosity and the number of correlated molecules l02l11ab over the entire range of cholesterol fraction . d normalizing to a reference state taken to be that of pure dppc for 20 and 30 mn m and 0.4 chol for 40 mn m surface pressures collapses the data onto a single universal curve relating surface viscosity to the molecular organization . figure 7b shows that the surface viscosity s of dppc chol monolayers decreases exponentially with increasing cholesterol fraction at a given surface pressure . in 2dimensions the diffusivity and free area can be related to the surface viscosity s via the saffmann delbrck model for a cylinder diffusing within a viscous monolayer surrounded by a viscous subphase to give an equation analogous to eq 3 in terms of the free area5from fitting dppc viscosity data we found that a0 40 which is roughly equal to ab cos the molecular area of a dppc molecule in a close packed untilted lattice table 2 . to better compare the data at different surface pressures the surface viscosity and correlated area are normalized relative to a reference composition xref at the same 8refxref is the surface viscosity and l02l11abref is the number of molecules in the coherence area at xref taken to be pure dppc for 20 and 30 mn m and 0.4 chol for 40 mn m . adding cholesterol decreases l02l11ab to 100 thereby increasing the free area per molecule to 1530 resulting in the dramatic decrease in surface viscosity . in summary gixd shows that increasing the chol fraction at constant surface pressure or increasing the surface pressure at constant chol fraction decreases the tilt of the dppc lattice while leaving the alkane chains close packed with an invariant area per molecule normal to the alkane chain direction . this confirms afm images that show cholesterol does not intercalate homogeneously into the dppc lattice but is expelled to disordered nanodomains that break up the dppc domains . hence the dppc cholesterol monolayer is better described as a nanostructured single phase monolayer rather than a mixture of two distinct phases similar to recently proposed two dimensional microemulsions . adding cholesterol does not change the local hexagonal dppc chain packing but does reduce the molecular tilt suggesting that cholesterol relieves some of the packing frustration between the dppc headgroup and tailgroups . most important to the monolayer dynamics the extent of order or the number of correlated molecules decreases with increasing cholesterol fraction at all surface pressures suggesting an increased number of lattice defects that create free area for visco diffusive transport . molecular defects and the associated decrease in domain size caused by the incompatibility of cholesterol packing into the alkane chain lattice enhance visco diffusive transport in monolayers . our model and data show that the extent of molecular correlations is an excellent predictor of the effects of the cholesterol on the surface viscosity of model lung surfactant monolayers .", " hence it is necessary to analyze the air pollution controlling plans with a pathologic approach to identify a set of practical solutions for tehran . this paper bears a twofold purpose first pathologically analyze air pollution control plans of tehran from the viewpoint of experts and secondly offer appropriate and effective solutions for controlling the air pollution . a descriptive case study method was used in 2012 for pathologic analysis of air pollution control plans in order to offer solutions for tehran metropolis as the capital city of iran . the context of the interview consists of the extent to which air pollution control plans of iran are appropriate and the ways to cope with the air pollutants in different sectors industry transportation systems and domestic system with regard to other metropolises experience in the very same field . the first theme is demonstrated in table 1 as causes and sources of air pollution of tehran metropolis . as it is depicted in the table the most vital sources of air pollution corresponds to the process of policy making lack of attention to environmental changes topogherafic status of tehran pollutant due to mobile and stationary sources and the matter of improper energy management . the second theme is demonstrated in table 2 as challenges obstacles towards effective performance of air pollution control plans of tehran metropolis . causes and sources of air pollution of tehran metropolis challenges obstacles towards effective performance of air pollution control plans of tehran metropolis as it is shown the most important challenges of tehran s air pollution management are focused on nine areas which we abstracted them into two wider categories including firstly air pollution stewardship challenges and secondly environmental political economic social and technical challenges . with regard to the fact that air pollution is one of national planning priorities in metropolitan areas the most effective controlling solutions for air pollution in the world the forth theme is demonstrated in table 5 as the most effective controlling alternatives for air pollution in tehran metropolis which is broken into two main categories first of all technical infrastructural factors then managerial administrative factors . the most effective controlling alternatives for air pollution in tehran metropolis the priorities of most effective controlling alternatives for air pollution in tehran metropolis our findings confirm that tehran s air pollution has been due to five major reasons including improper policy making no attention to the pollutants changes geographical situation mobile and stationary sources and nonstandard energy production . in iran same as other metropolises several plans are prepared and some are implemented but unfortunately thanks to some challenges mentioned above they failed to control tehran s air pollution as it was expected to be achieved in the plans . to solve the challenges and improve the quality and effectiveness of controlling air pollution plans should name paying more attention to the matter of stewardship in the field of air pollution management cultural and infrastructural development focusing on effective management system doing systematic studies before planning in other words systematizing the plan preparation process standardization of fuel and energy production and consumption enhancing public

limitation and transformed our approach to prevent hypoparathyroidism by introducing autotransplantation of cryopreserved parathyroid tissue . cryopreservation permits parathyroid tissue to be stored for potential reimplantation thereby avoiding the risk of needlessly implanting parathyroid tissue during initial surgery . the clinician is able to accurately determine whether any residual parathyroid tissue will recover function or whether a delayed autotransplant will be needed . the disadvantages of cryopreservation of parathyroid tissue include the potential of graft failure and the risk of graft dependent hypercalcemia . this paper provides an up to date comprehensive review of the cryopreservation of parathyroid tissue and its current role in thyroid and parathyroid surgery . the clear indication for an autotransplant of cryopreserved parathyroid tissue is permanent postoperative hypoparathyroidism . both a subtotal parathyroidectomy and a total parathyroidectomy can result in aparathyroidism so cryopreservation of parathyroid tissue is recommended at the time of the initial surgery . therefore cryopreservation of parathyroid tissue should be considered during parathyroid surgery when the iopth drop 80 . moreover such patients may require multiple operations to prevent aparathyroidism as a consequence of the initial or subsequent operations cryopreservation of parathyroid tissue is recommended . subsequent operations increase the risk of permanent aparathyroidism an outcome that cryopreservation of parathyroid tissue may prevent . a fragment of the parathyroid tissue may be cryopreserved for a possible delayed autotransplantation if future neck reoperations result in aparathyroidism . immediate autotransplantation of parathyroid tissue to prevent hypoparathyroidism impedes determination of surgical outcome which is unpredictable during redo parathyroid surgery . cryopreservation of parathyroid tissue rather than an immediate autotransplant allows the surgeon to appropriately predict surgical outcome the functionality of any remaining parathyroid tissue and the need for a delayed parathyroid autotransplant . cryopreservation of their parathyroid tissue is especially important because the long term renal effect of prolonged shpt and thpt predisposes patients to transient hypocalcemia from bone hunger . during reoperations for thyroid cancer a portion of any inadvertently removed or devascularized parathyroid glands should be sent for cryopreservation before any immediate autotransplant . patients who develop aparathyroidism during subsequent operations might later benefit from a delayed autotransplant of the cryopreserved parathyroid remnant . in addition cryopreserved parathyroid tissue should be utilized as soon as it is deemed necessary since a longer storage time limits delayed autotransplant success . the devastating effect of permanent aparathyroidism has been for the most part ameliorated by parathyroid gland cryopreservation and delayed autotransplants . cryopreservation allows the clinician to make appropriate decisions regarding the status of the remaining parathyroid glands . cryopreservation facilitates appropriate surgical and clinical decisions prevents unnecessary immediate parathyroid autotransplants and offers a chance to cure aparathyroidism .", " a major feature of the movement toward hospital cost containment in the last decade has been the replacement of expensive inpatient care with less costly outpatient care . a more important issue for hospital payment policy however is how actual costs have been affected by this shift from inpatient to outpatient services . changes in relative costs have important implications in the current environment of changing methods of payment for hospital outpatient services . an understanding of true cost increases is critical to the adoption of a plan that accurately reflects outpatient costs . in this article we provide a methodology for disaggregating total cost into inpatient and outpatient components to examine relative changes . this is accomplished through estimation of a multiple output total cost function for a sample of acute care hospitals for the years 1984 88 . if there is a discrepancy between the true cost of outpatient visits and the charges made for those visits distortion could occur in the establishment of their payment rates . in this section we describe a procedure for disaggregating total costs into inpatient and outpatient components which includes an estimable multiple output cost function . to identify outpatient costs we employ the concept of incremental costs as described in baumol panzar and willig 1988 . outpatient costs are the incremental costs incurred as a result of outpatient activity where oc represents outpatient costs tc represents total costs dis and opv represent the number of discharges and outpatient visits respectively and x is a vector of exogenous variables . given this breakdown of total costs hospital specific cost components can be obtained . one type estimates average cost per patient or per patient day as a function of various regressors that are considered to affect costs . because our major objective is to disaggregate total costs into inpatient and outpatient components the function to be estimated is a total cost function . as the focus is not scale or scope economies nor substitution of inputs we chose a form that although not derived from any particular production technology incorporates many factors likely to be important in explaining hospital cost variation . having no evidence that hospitals are in longrun equilibrium our expression is that of shortrun total costs geographic input price variation is a major determinant of cost variation . the second and third order terms for the variables for the number of inpatient discharges and outpatient visits are consistent with a cost function that exhibits u shaped average and marginal cost curves . the majority of data used in this analysis comes from two independent sources the american hospital association 1984 88 aha annual survey of hospitals and the hcfa hospital cost reporting information system hcris data files . the data bases of those 68 hospitals subject to all payer systems of payment were not comparable with those of the larger group the group of small hospitals exhibits cost structures that are distinctly different from those of hospitals having 100 or more beds . the implications of market concentration for hospital costs have been addressed in a number of recent works . zwanziger and melnick 1988 demonstrate that this effect is changing in california hospitals . the coefficients on the discharge outpatient visit and los variables exhibit a highly significant pattern of positive negative and positive for quantity quantity squared and quantity cubed respectively . the results of the estimated cost functions were used to disaggregate total costs into inpatient and outpatient components . equations 1 and 2 were evaluated for each hospital using the estimated cost function to determine hospital specific values . the results of the cost function disaggregation procedure indicate that the growth rate of outpatient costs did not differ substantially from that of inpatient costs despite considerable differences in the relative utilization patterns and revenue components . because the ratio of outpatient to inpatient costs remained relatively steady and the ratio of outpatient visits to discharges rose it follows that the ratio of the average incremental cost of an outpatient visit to the average cost of a discharge fell . because the trend in unit costs for outpatient services is a finding of this analysis that was unanticipated an interpretation of that result is in order . additional econometric evidence of economies of scale appears in a study of the determinants of 1987 medicare hospital outpatient department costs by miller 1992 . the variation in total costs resulting from outpatient activity is spread out over a larger number of visits . if a considerable amount of joint costs is assigned to inpatients by this methodology then our measure of outpatient costs is biased downward . the desired adjustment factor is the ratio of total cost to inpatient cost which converts non inpatient services to discharge equivalents . assuming that total costs are the sum of inpatient costs and outpatient costs the desired adjustment factor may be expressed as adjusted discharges are then calculated as the latter is algebraically equivalent to dividing inpatient cost by unadjusted discharges ic dis . this revenue based approximation to changes in unit costs substantially overestimates outpatient costs and cost increases and underestimates those of inpatient costs as observed by comparing the results listed in table 5 with those of table 4 . finally the adjustment factors calculated using the cost function approach to disaggregation of inpatient and outpatient components are listed with the aha adjustment factors in table 6 . the discrepancy between cost and revenue based unit costs and adjustment factors is most serious among hospitals that are smaller less urban and non teaching as seen by comparing the results listed in tables 4 and 5 as well as the results in table 6 . the growth rate of hospital outpatient costs has implications from the perspective of both policy and research . results of the present work indicate that the discrepancy between outpatient costs and revenues was significant and grew during the period 1984 88 . improvements in hospital accounting data would be beneficial for future research as well as in construction of drg and apg weights and payment levels .", " previous studies have reported several non wt1 loci with smaller effects on the genetic predisposition for wt including p53 gene insulin like growth factor ii gene ctnnb1 gene and h19 . however less than half of wt cases are attributable to known genes that are associated with wt risk therefore the exact pathogenesis of most wt cases remains unknown and identification of novel genetic loci is urgently needed . analyzed wt using single nucleotide polymorphism snp mapping array based comparative genomic hybridization and found chromosomal deletion in

analysis was conducted to investigate the associations between distribution of the genotype and allele of rs11788747 polymorphisms and clinicopathological features of wt patients . the findings of this novel study provide evidence of the effects of snps of reck on wt susceptibility and clinicopathologic status association . in the current study we explored the association of reck gene and wt risk and subsequently analyzed the effects of combinations of functionally related polymorphisms and clinicopathological features of wt patients . to the best of our knowledge this is the first study examining the association of reck gene polymorphism with wt risk although several previous studies have reported on its association with several other types of human cancers . therefore it is urgent for us to identify novel genetic loci that might be associated with wt risk . the interaction between reck gene and igf gene might have a potential influence on susceptibility to wt . therefore we conducted this study to determine whether reck gene is associated with wt risk . in the current study our findings suggest that mutant of rs10972727 in reck had an impact on increasing wt risk . finally we did not perform a functional study to further reveal the mechanism by which the genetic polymorphisms in reck affect wt risk . data from the present data indicate that rs10972727 in reck gene is not associated with wt risk in chinese children but the association between mutant g of rs11788747 in reck and wt risk was shown . therefore further research is necessary to reveal the mechanism by which the genetic polymorphisms in reck affect the wt risk ."], "all_summary": [" anthropometric study of elementary school students in shiraz revealed that 16 of them suffer from

could be inhibited for target specific insect control since multiple classes of insect immunity genes including signaling pathways can be under strong selection for diversification . as such the

measurements during cough syncope . cough syncope has been associated with posterior fossa mass lesions or tonsillar herniation and with hydrocephalus . the authors postulate that cough syncope in these patients might be the result of delayed recovery from hypotension that follows a paroxysm of cough and this was likely contributing to global cerebral hypoperfusion in our patient . this case highlights the fact that cough syncope a rare form of syncope may be associated with intracranial mass lesions that indirectly exaggerate the increase in icp in response to cough . recurrent cough syncope should trigger search for factors including brain tumors with the potential to cause transient elevation in icp . this case also illustrates an important role for ceeg monitoring with video in distinguishing syncope from seizures in cough syncope cases .", " although mir210 has been shown to be involved in regulation of physiological processes in various diseases and to be an up regulated

significant differences were observed between the percentages of nevi 59 primary melanoma 90 and metastatic melanoma 56 that expressed catenin in more than 90 of the cells p 0.02 figure 2 . the increase in tumor populations expressing rad6 from 37 of nevi to 100 of primary and metastatic melanomas was significant p 0.0001 figures 1 2 and 3 . accordingly rad6 and catenin expressions in primary melanoma were not correlated r 0.001 p 0.99 . however our results show that the expression levels of catenin do not contribute to melanoma initiation and progression since no difference in

signatures . for example when dg is oxidized in the presence of lysine products retaining the dg heterocycle and those with a core similar to dgh or dsp have been observed . esi ms figure s1 supporting information and the adducts observed that did not involve participation of nh3 during product formation included dz m 21 dog m 16 dgh m 6 and dsp m 32 scheme 2 . as expected this oxidant did not yield 8dsi based on its mechanism of oxidation . in summary one electron oxidant driven oxidations of dg in the presence of nh3 lead to spirocyclic adducts at c5 and c8 that are in competition with h2o adducts of the same core structure . first both 5 and 8dsi were stable at ph 10 during this time frame while 5dsi readily hydrolyzed to dsp at ph 3 in 30 min and 8dsi hydrolyzed to dsp after 10 h. for 5dsi deamination of the amine group can occur by two possible mechanisms 1 a retro acyl migration can occur followed by loss of nh3 to yield an electrophilic intermediate dog susceptible to h2o attack followed by a second acyl migration back to dsp or 2 acid catalyzed deamination can occur directly to furnish dsp scheme 5 . also for the 5dsi and 8dsi ammonia adducts nearly equal yields for the diastereomers were observed . a comparison between the contexts studied when dg was allowed to react with nh3 in the presence of the photooxidant riboflavin is provided in figure 5 . furthermore the increase in 8dsi yield from the dsodn oxidations further supports this product resulting from nucleophilic addition of nh3 at c8 leading to 8dsi and not the nh3 aminyl radical adding

old patient who developed retinal hemorrhages and cotton wool spots following intravenous administration of interferon.12 the underlying mechanisms of interferon induced retinopathy are not completely understood . similar to other studies459 our study also shows that retinal changes usually develop within the first 3 months of interferon treatment a fact that may favor an immune etiology rather than a cumulative effect of interferon leading to the development of retinopathy . retinopathy developed by week 14 in most of the patients 1316 81.25 after the start of therapy and disappeared in the

worsening muscle weakness it is unclear whether these processes are cross talked . given that the inflammatory response is a complex system cytokines are important not only as the indicators for mediating chronic inflammatory state through increasing protein degradation and reducing protein synthesis but also as the mediators for controlling muscle wasting by directly targeting muscle tissue . according to the analysis of mirna expression profiling mirnas are critical regulators for both proinflammatory cytokines and skeletal muscle function 82 83 . although there is no obvious difference in the expression of mature mir1 mir133 or mir206 in skeletal muscle from younger adults an increased expression of these primary mirnas can be observed during aging and the effect of anabolic stimulus on the levels of these mirnas can be perturbed in the elderly . it can downregulate sirtuin 1 sirt1 gene expression as a regulator so that the expression of mir181a and its target gene is

resulted in an overall new smear positive tb prevalence of 50100000 95 ci 1980100000 under the assumption of no cases in persons 15 years of age . two explanations may account for the large difference 1 the cdr derived from the tb prevalence survey is too high because of an underestimation of the prevalence of smear positive tb or 2 the cdr estimate published by who is too low because of an overestimation of the incidence of smear positive tb . in the national tb prevalence survey measures were taken to ensure high quality of the results e.g. estimation of the incidence of smear positive

observation after preliminary diagnosis by the physician and their median waiting time was 16 h. the next highest category of patients 16.4 was those who were waiting for diagnostics tests and their results with the median waiting time as 1 h. the number of patients who had completed the treatment process and waiting for doctors decision regarding discharge from eopd was also substantial 14.6 with the median waiting time of 2 h. maximum median waiting time 38 h was recorded for patients waiting for their turn for operative procedure after the decision to operate . overcrowded eds and poorly managed patient flow results in excessively long waits for patients increase in the risk of inappropriate care and poor quality of services . the higher use of the ed in the tertiary care hospitals can also be attributed to many reasons such as increase in the illness and chronic diseases changes in demographic and epidemiological trends of diseases increase in acute injuries changes in people s perception about emergency need for health problems better quality of health services rendered and growing population etc . to tackle the random inflow of patients it was recommended that experienced staffing in the ed should be matched with temporal arrival pattern of patients . through this study we tried to analyze the patient flow system by assessing the arrival and waiting time distribution of patients in the emergency out patient department eopd . this study will inform the hospital administrators and policy makers in effectively design a system so as to reduce waiting

various degrees of comorbidity and might not fit neatly into diagnostic categories yet they may benefit from a cbt program . the first question to answer regarded the degree to which the outcomes reported in the published literature regarding group cbt for depression would generalize to this different format . a final benchmark was an outpatient evaluation of group cbt for depressed patients treated within diagnostically heterogenous groups . first the change in symptoms from admission pre cbt post cbt to 6week followup was examined . although the changes during the cbt program are comparable to those in published studies one possible interpretation of the present findings is that the patients would have improved to the same degree due to their hospital stay . assuming a degree of symptom specificity of treatments because cbt is focussed on symptoms of depression and anxiety the changes in these domains should be greater during cbt whereas the earlier phase in an inpatient admission will be focussed on acute symptom management . although there was no difference in bdi scores before and after cbt between patients with more secondary medical conditions f6146 1.67 .06 p ns there was a hint that patients with more secondary substance use problems might have worse outcomes f3149 2.44 .05 p .07 . in particular it is also clear that packaging a cbt program as part of an inpatient treatment program can deliver comparable treatment outcomes to spaced treatments but it did not achieve these outcomes at the expense of longevity of treatment gains . the difference between inpatients who began the cbt program and those who did not suggests that the cbt program is providing benefits over and above treatment as usual . another future research question could relate to the ability to deliver cbt to homogeneous patient groups .", " starting from the index date the date of the first diagnosis of rvo during the study period until december 2009 all subjects meeting

challenges to the treating physician and pre ramadan diabetes assessment evaluations and diabetes education are important for successful management.1 this is because unplanned diabetes management during ramadan fasting may lead to hypoglycemia . hence in the past few decades efforts have been made by various researchers to manage diabetes during ramadan fasting without the risk of hypoglycemia . however this risk was significantly reduced when vildagliptin was prescribed during ramadan fasting and this has also been recently reported in indo pakistani populations from the uk and in cohorts of uk south asian muslim patients in the vector vildagliptin experience compared to gliclazide observed during ramadan study.4042 furthermore in general these agents have also been demonstrated to be safer in older age group.43 a recent observational study which combined metformin and vildagliptin therapy together with or without ohas during ramadan fasting has demonstrated advantage of reduced hypoglycemia incidence.44 they have shown one case of severe hypoglycemia in the arm treated with oha compared to the vildagliptin group which showed no hypoglycemia event . a recent review published in switzerland and france has studied worldwide the role of dpp4 inhibitors including vildagliptin during ramadan fasting and has come to the conclusion that the anti diabetic agents dpp4 inhibitors could be a more safer option while managing type2 diabetes during ramadan fasting with a very low risk of hypoglycemia.47 another prospective noninterventional study published in france to assess real life rate of hypoglycemia during ramadan fasting in patients with type 2 diabetes and their ongoing dual therapy of metformin vildagliptin or metformin sulfonylurea has shown that hypoglycemia as an adverse events aes was higher in su group as compared to vildagliptin group 17.9 vs 7.5 p0.025 and better compliance was seen with vildagliptin group.48 the virtue vildagliptin experience compared with sulphonylureas observed during ramadan study which recruited 1333 patients from 10 different countries worldwide has demonstrated significantly fewer hypoglycemia events as compared with su therapy 5.4 vs 19.8 respectively p0.001 . this is true especially in high risk population such as elderly and those with renal impairment or those who require insulin based therapy with metformin and dpp4 inhibitors.445256 despite the islamic rule of exemption most of the diabetic patients essentially fast during ramadan and this fact should be considered while managing diabetes during ramadan fasting.12 drugs such as dpp4 inhibitors vildagliptin should be selected with other diabetes medications as these are not associated with high risk of hypoglycemia . furthermore survey results have shown that 53 of patients fasted against medical advice.57 however this can be prevented effectively by extensive dsme and ramadan focused diabetes management ramadan education and awareness in diabetes read program and similar studies have demonstrated promising and good results in terms of minimizing hypoglycemia risk during ramadan fasting.15859 effective diabetes education for patients empowerment and motivation with self care awareness involves health care professional teams families the community and religious authorities as well.6061 additionally newer antidiabetic agents such as vildagliptin dpp4 inhibitor that are associated with lower risk of hypoglycemia are considered to be one of the safer options while managing diabetes during ramadan fasting and have also shown higher treatment adherence as compared to other medications.62", " they also suggested that progression can be true progression only in the cases of recurrence outside the radiation field or in

of the present study was to investigate the differences in sitting posture of children with cp while they sat on school chairs . it is known that dynamic postural control during sitting can be reliably assessed using cop data of infants who are developing typically or infants with or at risk of cp14 . the principal finding of this study is that cp children s sitting posture is asymmetrical leaning to the less paretic side . we thought that infants who are developing typically develop the ability to sit by exhibiting an optimal range of movement variability whereas cp may present either too much or too little variability leading to a very rigid and narrow or unpredictable set of movement solutions to achieve independent sitting .", " in this study alpha value was taken as one

gsls are dependent on the organizations of the gsls and molecules surrounding the gsl enriched domains . although gsl enriched microdomains have been implicated in a number of important membrane events 2 38 39 the molecular mechanisms responsible for gsl mediated cell functions are still unclear . gpi anchored proteins are composed of glycerol phospholipids which do not have c24 fatty acid

ageing of human diploid fibroblasts hdfs first described by hayflick and moorhead has become a classical experimental model to study cellular ageing . cells with less than 10 passages were considered young cells with high proliferative ability while cultures at 1020 passages have entered an intermediate state or pre senescence and cultures of over 25 passages with no detectable doubling in cell numbers for 2 weeks were considered as senescent cells . a comparison of the telomere shortening rates in different hdfs under different conditions revealed that the ratio between oxidative damage and antioxidative defence was quantitatively the most important determinant of telomere shortening . in view of this this study was designed to evaluate the molecular mechanism of tocotrienol rich

diseases where specific proteins accumulate as pathological aggregates . an important question is whether the special assembly properties of rbps puts them at risk of aggregating during aging in a multicellular organism and not just in the context of disease . by western blot we confirmed that reduced daf2 signaling abrogated their aggregation with age figures 1e and s2b . a hallmark of protein aggregation associated with disease is the immobility of proteins within the aggregates . our proteomic study revealed that reduced daf2 signaling efficiently prevents the insolubility of stress granule components with age . collectively these results reveal that hsf1 is an important regulator of sgrbp aggregation throughout life and it contributes to maintaining dynamic stress granule proteins in long lived daf2 mutants . conversely kin19 aggregation was slightly impeded by pab1 overexpression figure 6d indicating that sgrbp aggregation does not cross seed kin19 aggregation . significantly one of the main outcomes of the longevity program initiated by reduced daf2 signaling while responding to widespread protein aggregation is the preservation of rbp solubility with age . in this study we have examined in detail the aggregation pattern of pab1 and tiar2 two key rbps with lc prion like domains that are important for the formation of stress granules . during the aging process both proteins spontaneously assembled into small puncta similar to liquid droplets induced during stress and into larger aggregates . because our proteomic analysis revealed a number of stress granule components in the insoluble proteome it is likely that secondary stress granule proteins are also incorporated . in support of a gain of function related to sgrbp aggregation two rare diseases are caused by mutated pabpn1 and tia1 the human homologs of pab1 and tiar2 which accumulate in pathological aggregates brais et al .", " secondary efficacy objectives compared individual preoperative

reliability might mean for health care by analyzing what is known about how highly reliable organizations function . how close or far away is the typical hospital today from this state of high reliability we rarely observe the five principles of high reliability guiding the actions of organizations their leaders and caregivers . a specific example helps illuminate the complexities of the barriers that hospitals face in trying to be sensitive to these safety signals . few however have moved beyond tabulating survey results to taking effective actions that have resulted in creating the kind of safety culture that supports high reliability . a team at the joint commission has been engaged with high reliability experts from academia and industry since 2010 to assimilate what is known about hros with the institutional knowledge we have gained from our work in health care quality and safety . a hospital approaching high reliability adopts health it solutions in a coordinated and integrated manner following the principles of safe adoption joint commission 2008b karsh 2004 . a culture of safety that fully supports high reliability has three central attributes trust report and improve reason and hobbs 2003 . as hospitals make more progress toward high reliability they will include safety culture metrics as part of their strategic planning programs set goals for improving on those metrics and report on those metrics to their boards just as they report on metrics related to financial performance or patient satisfaction . many health care leaders are reluctant to commit to the goal of high reliability because they regard it as unrealistic or unachievable or a distraction from their current serious fiscal and regulatory pressures . in order to move effectively toward high reliability both the formally appointed leaders chief medical officer vice president for medical affairs and the informal leaders medical staff president voluntary medical staff leaders need to

drug induced in 90 of the cases characterized by a widespread sterile pustular rash . agep is a disease characterized by the rapid onset of many sterile nonfollicular pustules usually arising on an edematous erythema and frequently accompanied by leukocytosis and fever . the main differential diagnosis of agep is pustular psoriasis . because the pustules clinically and histologically resemble the lesions of pustular psoriasis and because in a number of reports patients had a history of plaque psoriasis some authors assume that agep is nothing more than an acute exacerbation of psoriasis caused by a variety of exogenous triggers however many studies strongly suggest that agep is not associated with psoriasis 1 5 . in this group the present case of agep has well defined criteria and

mechanism of action involves limiting the firing of excessive sodium dependent action potentials.1 ruf has been reported to reduce the number of drop attacks and major motor seizure in about 60 of patients with lgs and has subsequently been regarded as an effective adjunctive therapeutic agent.2 in recent years studies have been reported that ruf is also efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of various epilepsy syndromes other than lgs including cases of refractory epilepsy in pediatric patients.3 however there are still limited data regarding the long term treatment results of

two cases that both developed cataract before the age of 50 years on the side affected from the cluster headache and reviewed published similar cases and potential mechanisms for comorbidity . references were identified by searches of pubmed from 1966 until october 2007 with the terms cluster headache and cataract . therefore to our knowledge this is the first report of cataract occurring in cluster headache patients and interestingly on the same eye affected by the pain attack . it is of interest that both patients developed cataract in a young age after suffering for years from chronic cluster headache attacks and in the absence of main risk factors for the development of early onset cataract including prolonged steroid drugs exposure . however because we could not investigate the pedigree of one patient any hypothetical genetic link between the uncommon occurrence of early onset cataract and cluster headache can not be proposed . thus no speculation can be made on a possible causal relationship between repeated episodes of pain inflammation and autonomic abnormalities that are considered to contribute to the cluster headache attack and the precocious occurrence of the cataract . however this first evidence of the occurrence of cataract in relatively young adult men with a history of chronic cluster headache is of importance because underlining

main downside to these instruments is that they require a significant amount of time and involve numerous steps increasing the potential for tear evaporation as such they are not practical especially for dry eye patients with low tear volumes.34 a newer technology produced by tearlab uses a micro electrode to measure the number of charged particles in a tear sample this electrode is designed to avoid direct contact with the ocular surface thereby reducing the chance for reflex tearing.3 the tearlab measurement method appears as accurate as the more involved osmometers differing on average by only 2 mosm l in both normal and dry eye patients.3 the tear lab device requires only a small tear sample 0.2 l and is able to provide results almost instantly reducing the level of tear evaporation.35 when compared with a vapor pressure osmometer the tearlab osmolarity system was able to measure more patients with lower volume tear samples.4 compared to the clifton osmometer the tearlab device was reported to have similar sensitivity but slightly better specificity and positive predictive value.3 the aim of the current review is to establish whether published studies support the use of tear osmolarity testing primarily using the tearlab device as a tool for ded diagnosis and treatment monitoring . comments from the literature related to the role of tear osmolarity in the pathophysiology of ded and how ocular or systemic conditions and pharmaceuticals impact tear osmolarity are also discussed . a more detailed review of the remaining papers related to tear osmolarity tear osmolarity research before the year 2000 was limited in scope methodology and applicability . one factor here is that the general correlation between objective tests and subjective tests for dry eye is poor.1 this issue is likely due to the multiple etiologies and presentations of ded when particular tests are specific to one etiology then there may be a lack of overall correlation.1 like other diagnostic signs tear osmolarity may not correlate with symptoms in a general population18 although it has been shown to correlate over time with effective therapy as described in the pharmacological effects and treatment section of the present review . in the same study9 a minority of patients 8 or 225 had increased tear osmolarity and no symptoms or low tear osmolarity and symptoms this result may be due to them having only mild ded in the former case and low osmolarity due to a condition other than ded in the latter case . it may also be due to the difference in disease severity of the tested groups given the strong correlation between tear osmolarity and disease severity.911 the more severe the ded the higher the threshold and the greater the variability in the tear osmolarity value.9 the currently agreed upon value that discriminates between healthy and dry eyes is when the higher tear film osmolarity value of the two eyes is 308 mosm l.510 as with any diagnostic tool interpretation must be based on the complete clinical picture including other diagnostic tests that might be helpful in determining the dry eye etiology.10 certain commonly encountered external factors such as contact lens wear may or may not increase tear osmolarity depending on the individual response.224 the impact of environmental factors such as temperature humidity and airflow on tear osmolarity appears unclear as is the effect of sex hormones these factors would benefit from further investigation.2021253637 the effect of ocular surgery on tear osmolarity may be partially dependent on the patient s age the type of surgery performed and the ability of the eye to recover.2629 systemic conditions commonly believed to result in dry eye such as dehydration diabetes and thyroid ophthalmopathy have been shown to increase tear osmolarity as expected.313235 ocular conditions such as herpetic keratitis pterygia and pseudoexfoliation syndrome have also been demonstrated to increase tear osmolarity.383941 keratoconus largely viewed clinically as a non inflammatory condition was not associated with increased tear osmolarity.40 some pharmaceuticals such as mucin altering drugs and glaucoma medications appear to increase tear osmolarity while others such as artificial tears likely lower tear osmolarity.202843 research into the effect of anti inflammatory medications on tear osmolarity has produced varied results the topic deserves further investigation.484951 there are limitations in any review of this nature and consequently to any of our comments related to the factors associated with osmolarity .", " in veterans undergoing noncardiac surgery the incidence of preoperative anemia hematocrit 36 was 34 and in surgical patients who refused

and are known to modify airway tone as well as inflammatory responses . in in vitro studies using macrophages alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells ros have been shown to induce gene expression of inflammatory mediators such as il1 and tnf 57 58 . it is therefore understandable that dysregulation of pi3k has been implicated in the induction andor progression of a variety of disease states including those of the respiratory tract ranging from asthma to cancer . aberrant expression or signaling patterns of these receptors have also been linked to the progression of a diversity of diseases including asthma . multiple studies have also reported that stimulation of airway epithelial cells by lps induces the secretion of il8 via a cellular cascade involving a tlr4myeloid differentiation primary response gene myd88nfb dependent pathway . furthermore inhibition of the p38 mapk pathway was shown to exert anti inflammatory effects through inhibition of il1 il6 and tnf expression . in airway smooth muscle cells there is solid evidence that both erk and p38 mapk pathways contribute to il1induced cox2 expression and pge2 synthesis 76 77 . in addition we also found that lta or il1 could induce cpla2 cox2 or mmp9 in human airway smooth muscle cells or a549 cells 3 44 .", " in 1964 there have been some reports till date that describe the association of malignant

vivo could plausibly accelerate the progression of pre malignant pancreatic intra epithelial panin lesions which occur frequently even in apparently normal pancreatic parenchyma hruban et al . 2011 also observe differences in the histopathological spectrum of pancreatic malignancies from mice in which brca2 as well as tp53 had been inactivated when compared to tp53 deficiency alone . our results suggest that brca2 heterozygosity suffices for pdac formation driven by mutant kras in mice and men . because pdac gemms incorporate high penetrance genetic events such as initiating oncogenes or inactivated tumour suppressor genes from an early stage in a large number of susceptible cells the resulting stereotypy of the malignancies arising therein may not reflect the heterogeneity likely to be present in human cancers . brca2 in models of pancreatic cancer may promote the stochastic acquisition of genetic and consequent morphologic heterogeneity due to the expected increase in mutation

exendin4 on glucose level should play only a minor effect on its antiatherosclerogenetic properties . in conclusion our data suggest that glp1 receptor activation significantly reduced the

possibility of a novel treatment for diabetes inhibition of the type 2 sodium glucose transporter sglt2 a 672 amino acid high capacity low affinity transmembrane protein that promotes reabsorption of glucose as the glomerular filtrate passes down the nephrons.10 several candidate molecules are currently in development and may soon be available for use in the treatment of diabetes . a detailed summary of clinical findings has recently been published.55 the mechanism of action of sglt2 inhibitors predicts a beneficial effect but the long term glucose lowering capacity in a clinical setting may not impart significant reductions in hba1c . treatments targeting post prandial glucose levels provide little more than modest improvements in hba1c with little evidence of long term outcome benefits for patients.57 as sglt2 may be responsible for as much as 90 of glucose reabsorption by the kidney there is the clinical potential for as much as 160 g of glucose to be excreted each day following effective sglt2 inhibition.23 however it appears that the actual glucose loss achieved in clinical studies is only about half that predicted.38 it is not clear whether this is a consequence of compensating mechanisms undertaking tubular reabsorption or incomplete inhibition of the transporter . clearly compared with less specific molecules the potential for it is also unlikely that sglt2 inhibitors will induce hypoglycemia since when plasma glucose levels are low the amount of glucose excreted will also be low.59 this prediction appears to be confirmed by clinical studies reported thus far which show no apparent increases in hypoglycemic episodes with sglt2 inhibitors.5060 even when sglt2 is blocked completely a degree of renal glucose recovery is maintained via the relatively unhindered sglt1 transporter . increased glucose content in the urine following sglt2 inhibition will likely serve to increase urinary flow as a consequence of the osmotic diuretic effect in the lumen of the nephron .", " the absence of df testing may have medico legal implications whether a device fails to terminate ventricular fibrillation vf during follow up . itt full analysis set all patients

6676qaly and increased to 6960qaly respectively confirming the robustness of the estimations . hdf seems a little more expensive for instance the icers of the younger patients rise from 5878qaly and 5732qaly to 7748qaly and 7724qaly for female and male patients respectively table 2 . therefore this study recommends prioritizing the research which evaluates the qol related to hdf .", " alzheimer s

nanopore membrane were placed in contact with 1 m kcl . due to the conical pore shape the concentrations of edc and dna were high at the first tens of nanometers at the narrow tip and decayed hyperbolically along the pore axis . opening diameters of the modeled nanopore were set at 5 and 500 nm it is well known that the pores rectify only if the walls have excess surface charge and when the pore diameter is comparable to the thickness of the electrical double layer siwy and fulinski 2002 cervera et al . at 1 m kcl attachment of dna caused a decrease of 2.5fold of ion current compared to a non modified pore fig . our experimental results provide evidence that the level of nanopore blockage and most likely the persistence length of tethered dna increase with lower kcl concentration

784 in the dn population figure 2b tables s6 s7 and s8 . because the aim of this study consisted at deciphering the transcriptional signatures that confer the functional specializations of mrgprd expressing cutaneous free nerve ending and c ltmrs we analyzed the expression patterns of 48 dp enriched genes and 68 c ltmtrs enriched genes . 12 genes showed some expression in few ginip ib4 neurons 17 genes showed lower expression in discrete subsets of small 317 or medium to large size neurons 1417 and 19 genes were expressed in broader neuronal subsets in addition to intense expression in dp neurons figures 2c2e dp ish library . 2013 our rna seq data in combination with ish and gene ontology analysis revealed a great number of genes expressed in dp neurons but not in c ltmrs and vice versa reflecting their anatomical and functional differences . c ltmrs on the other hand expressed different gpcrs than those expressed in dp neurons such as cckar and the metabotropic gq p2y1 receptor and showed a striking enrichment in voltage gated channels including potassium channels kcnq2 kcnj12 kcnv1 kcna2 and kcna4 sodium channels and associated beta subunits scn1a scn1b scn3b scn4b scn7a and scn8a and the low voltage gated calcium channels cacna1h and cacna1i . among the three t type channels we found cav3.2 and cav3.3 highly present in c ltmrs with cav3.3 being exclusively expressed in this particular class of neurons . our rna seq data in combination with ish and electrophysiological recordings provided a clear demonstration that cav3.3 is a specific marker of c ltmrs and offers a new possible selective pharmacological target to control c ltmrs excitability in mice .", " moreover in order to clear the er from the accumulation of terminally misfolded protein aggregates that can not be degraded by the proteasome the upr may upregulate the autophagy machinery 5 6 . depending on the cellular context activation of jnk can either allow the cells to adapt to er

services that are located in different organizations lindberg observed examples of meaningful co operation at the local level with colleagues from different organizations meeting and pooling their knowledge of local conditions with the patient or user as the focal point . according to brommels in his presentation to the ehma conference 2006 the cas approach means among other things identifying and supporting constructive relations between agents within the system and understanding tensions and conflicts.avoiding strict definitions of roles and concentrating on agreed actions.giving agents their freedom to organize current activities . rationality for example requires that all integral parts act on perfect information have the same background and similar values and work towards the same goals and that there is a system designer the top manager who is from outside the system . it also enables us to develop locally adapted solutions in order to manage complex tasks such as we find in advanced home health care . and the term complex emphasizes that the necessary competence to perform a task is not owned by any one part but comes as a result of co operation within the system . although more research is needed to achieve greater understanding of complex adaptive systems and to strengthen the knowledge base for action we do have a growing number of examples that show the cas concept gaining ground within the health and social services . another example comes from elderly care where the cas concept has been applied to secure agreement between politicians and civil servants . instead holden talks about direction without directives it has been found that for purposes of fostering connectivity among diverse agents effective coupling of structures ideas and innovations and ensuring that they are neither too loose nor too tightly interdependent complex systems are better led by indirect than by direct leadership behaviours . are we willing to face the interdependence between health and social services the dependence on collaboration to deliver appropriate integrated care if we do complexity science could be an important step towards fresh thinking in order to

edematous swelling of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal structures in combination with macroglossia.3 it has been shown that macroglossia in hypothyroidism is caused by a thickening of the epithelial tissue.6 these changes can also explain the choking and the dysphagia which this patient experienced . there have been a few reports of hypothyroidism responsible for secondary dysphagia.1012 her sleep apnea may also be a manifestation of hypothyroidism most likely caused by edema and myopathy.7 sleep apnea attributable to hypothyroidism is reversible with thyroxin replacement therapy.8 the

intrathoracic endotracheal metastasis after rt . we believe this to be the first reported case of intrathoracic endotracheal metastasis in an npc patient . however 2 months later a metastatic nodule about 1.5 1.1 cm was found in the left lower lobe of the lung . similarly tracheal metastasis from a very distant site has also been poorly documented and the upper trachea is the most frequently involved site . to the best of our knowledge there is no report on intrathoracic endotracheal metastasis with nasopharyngeal origin . distant metastasis after treatment is the main problem in npc patients with advanced disease . it is not certain whether the secondary tracheal tumor is the consequence of the lung metastasis . the presence of endophytic tumor growth and the intact outer layer of the trachea found on ct images suggest that it was most likely a separate metastatic deposit .", " among the various methods available to quantify proteinuria alternative methods like a spot urine

populations in the horizontal saccade controller . investigation of muscle fiber model is imperative because it allows for recognizing the effects of the firing of individual neurons as well as the number of active neurons firing maximally in controlling the saccades . in this paper we focus on neural control of horizontal monkey saccades . in consequence to match the dynamics of the neurons and the synapses saccadic circuitry including omnipause neuron opn premotor excitatory burst neuron ebn inhibitory burst neuron ibn long lead burst neuron llbn tonic neuron tn interneuron in and motoneurons of abducens nucleus an and oculomotor nucleus on finally the motoneuronal control signals drive a time optimal controller that stimulates a mfm model of the oculomotor plant . for small saccades the controller is constrained by a required minimum duration of the agonist pulse . as motoneurons receive excitatory input from the ipsilateral ebn the burst discharge in them during a saccade is adequately similar to the ebn bursting . the following includes our modeling of the premotor and motor neurons at the circuit level . each neuron s dendrite rise time constant determines the delay to emulate the postsynaptic potential propagation along the dendrite consistent with the initiation of firing with respect to the saccade onset provided in table 1 . the saccade induced spiking activities at the premotor level are modeled with an hh model for the bursting neurons . as described the number of active neurons impacts the control of saccades instead of the variations in the firing rate of those neurons under the time optimal control strategy . in addition the number of active neurons differs from saccade to saccade as evident by the dynamics observed in the main sequence diagrams 3 12 . each active neuron exhibits the pause slide step firing trajectory as later shown in figure 11 substantiating the physiological accuracy of the agonist controller model . furthermore the burst onset and offset for each premotor neuron in figure 10 agreed with its place within saccadic circuitry s hierarchical processing order in generating the final motoneuronal signals . presented in figure 11 are the ipsilateral agonist first and third rows and antagonist second and last rows burst tonic firing rates with their respective active state tensions for the saccades . the computer simulations of neural circuitry herein allow synaptic stimuli to propagate through the saccade pathways so that the motoneurons ultimately drive the oculomotor plant .", " smoking cessation with the use of electronic cigarette led to reversal of chronic idiopathic neutrophilia . electronic cigarettes were invented in 2003 with awareness and use increasing significantly

causes of the bowel wall thickening and in order to evaluate the terminal ileum colonoscopic examination was performed . in addition the terminal ileum was dilated and showed diffuse concentric wall thickening of its long segments with heterogeneous contrast enhancement . in the thickened wall there appeared to be several possible diagnoses including ischemic enterocolitis caused by thromboembolism of mesenteric vessels arising from atrial fibrillation inflammatory bowel disease involving the ascending colon and terminal ileum and ischemic or infectious enteritis associated with colon cancer . at this time the hepatic flexure of the ascending colon was found to be completely obstructed by a hard concentric mass and about 15 cm of the terminal ileum just proximal to the ileocecal valve was markedly dilated and diffusely thickened . a cut section of the thickened terminal ileum revealed marked submucosal edema to a depth of approximately 10 mm though there was no evidence of mucosal lesion . microscopic examination also showed that the mucosal folds of thickened ileal loop were blunted by submucosal edema and there was extensive inflammatory reaction with infiltrations of neutrophils . 6 reported the ct findings in one case in which only nonspecific small bowel wall thickening with a small amount of ascites was noted .", " in patients with

without hematuria or casts urinary ph was 7.5 and urinary density 1005 . the upper half of the right kidney showed an area of reduced perfusion while the left kidney showed abnormal tissue density . in this patient the presenting signs and symptoms of neuroblastoma included severe dehydration polyglobulia tubulointerstitial damage with acute kidney injury and renal insufficiency electrolyte and acid base unbalancing and heavy glomerular proteinuria . although diarrhea and dehydration may be observed at presentation of neuroblastoma tubular alterations are definitely unusual . we have been able to identify only one case previously a 4year old boy affected by neuroblastoma presenting with nephrotic syndrome has been described in 1979 and renal histology demonstrated membranous glomerulonephritis due to immune complex . increased vasoactive amine secretion from neuroblastoma is not infrequent and may cause elevated although usually not severe hypertension . in conclusion in our 10month old child alteration of the renal function at both the glomerular and tubular levels were the presenting features of neuroblastoma resulting from multiple pathogenic mechanisms .", " in recent years nevertheless the correlation and function of mirnas and their target genes in pathogenesis of pituitary adenomas remain largely unknown . mir15a and mir16 1 genes are located at chromosome 13q14 a region which is frequently deleted in pituitary tumors . in 2005 mir15a and mir16 1 were reported to have lower expression in both gh secreting and prl secreting pituitary adenomas than in normal tissues and their downregulation was correlated with greater tumor volume and impaired secretion of p43 a potent anticancer cytokine suggesting that mir15a and mir16 1 may function as tumor suppressors and their inactivation may contribute to tumor growth in pituitary adenomas . in 2007 the most representative ones were mir212 mir026a mir150 mir152 mir191 and mir192 which were upregulated in pituitary adenomas while mir024 1 and mir098 were downregulated in tumor samples . besides mir107 was found to be overexpressed in gh secreting and nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas and inhibited the expression of pituitary tumor suppressor gene aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein aip . moreover mir26a was also overexpressed in acth secreting pituitary adenomas and plays an important role in cell cycle control by modulating protein kinase c delta . interestingly the inhibition of mir26b and overexpression of mir128 had a synergistic effect on suppressing the tumorigenicity and invasiveness of pituitary tumors . although metastatic pituitary carcinomas are rare these data suggest that altered expression of mirnas may provide diagnostic information to distinguish pituitary adenomas and carcinomas before they metastasize .", " altmetrics creates a new approach to evaluating the impact of publications by considering the number of downloads shares and

nonpedunculated protruding polypoid mass four cases5678 obstructive lesions of the colon caused by mucosal edema or a tumor two cases910 or mucosal discoloration one case.11 here we report the case of a colonic malt lymphoma presenting as a semipedunculated polyp that was removed by endoscopic mucosal resection emr . malt lymphoma a subtype of non hodgkin lymphoma is classified as an extranodal marginal zone b cell lymphoma and is a lymphoepithelial lesion characterized by epithelial infiltration by lymphoplasma cells.12 malt lymphoma of the stomach is known to be associated with helicobacter pylori infection11 whereas nongastric malt lymphomas have been associated with borrelia burgdorferi chlamydia psittaci hepatitis c virus campylobacter jejuni and autoimmune disease.12 colonic malt lymphoma occurs at an average age of 59.8 years and shows no sex preference . however in some rare cases intestinal obstruction or intussusception can appear.9101314 systemic symptoms such as fever and weight loss are rare because most malt lymphomas are well localized and slow growing.12 according to endoscopic findings a malt lymphoma of the colon usually appears as a sessile protruding lesion or ulcerative lesion and the former is approximately 10 times more common than the latter.1415 sites of tumor growth have been reported to be the cecum 71.5 rectum 16.9 and ascending colon 6.2 however the sigmoid colon is only rarely affected.16 eight cases have been reported in korea and these are summarized in table 1 . a malt lymphoma can be diagnosed during surgery or endoscopic biopsy . however malt lymphoma usually presents as a single lesion whereas mantle cell lymphoma presents as multiple lymphomatous polyposis in the gastrointestinal tract and without lymphoepithelial lesions.18 immunohistochemically these two types can be differentiated by the cyclin d1 status because malt lymphomas and mantle cell lymphomas are immunonegative and immunopositive for cyclin d1 respectively.14 in our case histological findings showed that lymphoepithelial lesions were caused by the invasion of the mucosa by atypical lymphocytes and that they were cyclin d1 negative with a ki67 labeling index of 10 to 20 which indicated a diagnosis of low grade malt lymphoma . in the described case malt lymphoma presented as a semipedunculated polyp during colonoscopy and diagnosis and treatment planning were performed on the basis of the results of emr . more case reports and studies about colonic malt lymphoma presenting with variable morphology are needed to establish guidelines for the treatment of colonic malt lymphomas in the near future .", " in the histological qualitative analysis the graft recipient site interface the presence of the following items was assessed adhesive fragments inflammatory infiltrate fibroblastic proliferation and new bone and capillary formation in superficial and deep tissues . at the interface between the graft and the recipient site it was possible to observe a thin layer of compact fibrous connective tissue and areas of bone remodeling both at the graft and the parietal bone . adjacent to the fibrous capsule it was possible to notice the bone graft with its osteocyte lacunae containing basophilic nucleus . in several specimens this new bone formation occurs only at the central third of the graft and their margins remained joined to the donor area by a compact connective tissue figure 3 . in the graft proximal areas in some specimens a bone union with the recipient site was observed however in most of the animals this union could not be identified because the region was filled with a lymphocyte type inflammatory infiltrate some blood vessels and several collagen fibers that maintained continuity with the capsule collagen fibers . discrete areas of new bone formation were observed in the internal surfaces of the grafts surfaces that were in contact with the ca . areas of new bone formation bn

oxidant effects of chronic al exposure disrupt normal development in baby rats . after systemic intravenous al exposure in rats and rabbits the extracellular al concentrations were seen to increase primarily in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of the brain . indeed an earlier study investigating the effects of al in the ontogenetic development of cholinergic and serotonin neurotransmitter receptors in the brain demonstrated that not only is the time of exposure to al important for the effects seen but also the timing of the exposure . in the present study we focused in particular on the neurotoxic effects of al in terms of the growth and development of the brain with the exposure of developing chicks to al . similarly histopathological examinations of the hippocampus in 2 rat models following al treatment showed marked changes in general brain histology as indicated by an increased number of vacuolated spaces and more specifically effects on the neuronal connectivity in the hippocampus .", " the risk of rd is 4 times higher in patients who have undergone cataract surgery 5 6 . group 2 g2 n 53 included macula on patients with reattached retina and who experienced visual loss at the third month of follow up . for our patients with macula on rds the evaluations were made only by indirect ophthalmoscopy or fundus biomicroscopy at 24 or 48 hours prior to the surgery . as mentioned we did not perform oct on patients preoperatively to rule out a subclinical extension of subretinal fluid under the fovea a reason which could explain why some eyes with similar alterations have functional results significantly better than others . first is that the study design was not intended to solve the question of vision loss in patients with macula on rd but in view of the lack of reports on va loss after macula on rd surgery we have considered that our data could be interesting .", " in particular ros are involved in the diclofenac induced apoptosis of cultured gastric cells as well as in nephrotoxicity in vivo 9 10 furthermore an oxidative injury causes the mitochondrial permeability transition in diclofenac treated hepatocytes . to this aim the dose and time dependent effects of this drug on sod2 protein levels of sh sy5y cells were analysed in the experiments reported in figure 3 . a deeper insight on the involvement of mitochondria in the diclofenac induced apoptosis was realised with a western blotting analysis aimed at the evaluation of the cytochrome c release from mitochondria . for these reasons in our in vitro studies we have used a diclofenac concentration of 150 m because this value corresponded to the maximal concentration of this compound not causing cytotoxicity as determined by cytotoxicity assays on sh sy5y cells . in particular this process is associated to a significant and concomitant reduction of both protein level and enzymatic activity of sod2 whereas rt pcr experiments showed that the corresponding mrna levels are not affected by the diclofenac treatment .", " there are no reports of illnesses caused by e. coli in farmed fish but resistant strains may be selected due to the presence of antibiotics in

converts dopamine to norepinephrine . an immunohistochemical study showed that the tumor was positive for neuroendocrine markers such as cd56 synaptophysin and chromogranin .", " an evaluation of the national hospital discharge survey and census date for vte in the united states reported an annual incidence of 0.49 per 10000 with peak rates in the neonatal period and adolescence.12 the majority of children with vte have multiple risk factors for thromboembolic disease at presentation such as catheter related thrombosis infection and congenital prothrombotic disorders.3 a pe is a very rare event in children but the mortality rate is reported to be approximately 10.4 hypereosinophilia is rarely associated with a pe in adults however this condition has not been reported in children . his general condition gradually improved with the concomitant resolution of the pulmonary thromboembolism and pulmonary hypertension .", " the extent of association between anxiety depression and social support to hemodialysis patients has seldom been the subject of systematic enquiry . there was a statistically significant association between anxiety depression and social support from significant others family and friends p0001 for all associations . lastly multinomial logistic regression was performed to assess the effect of social support on the levels of anxiety and depression adjusted to various potential confounding factors affecting anxiety and depression . furthermore we conclude that after adjusting for confounding factors statistically significant effect of social support from friends we had on anxiety levels p0004 and more specifically an one point increase in the support from friends reduces by 57 the chances that patients will have high levels of anxiety in relation to not having at all anxiety . from table 2 we conclude that patients felt highly supported from their significant others and their family median 6 for both subscales and less from their friends median 4.5 neutral support levels . 26 illustrated that persistently high anxiety and depression are associated with reduced perceived social support .", " chest x ray revealed massively dilated esophagus

system and anatomical comparisons are essential for selection of a suitable organ as well as to gather sufficient pre clinical data . in addition both a morphological evaluation and measurement of the diameter of the svc and inferior vena cava ivc were also performed . accurate preoperative imaging of donor vasculature is of great importance because vascular variations such as accessory arteries and early branching are particularly important when determining optimal organ extraction procedures and the type of anastomosis . for example hepatic arteries with diameters less than 3 mm are considered to present a high surgical risk for liver transplantation thus accurate preoperative evaluation of the arterial diameter is essential for successful organ transplantation .", " add the

mrna assay read out represents the outcome of a long series of steps each of which potentially contributing to the overall variability of the quantification operation . 2 reasonable questions to ask are whether the various labeling steps alter the original distribution of the mrnas samples and if they do to what extent does this occur in order to address these questions an experiment could be designed utilizing a large quantity of rna from distinct contrasted biological systems . inferring a bonafide relationship between changes in the level of a given mrna molecule level with the change in the biological response under study requires providing evidence that the observed variation is explained mainly by the biological factor and not by a confounding event . the amount of light intensity unit of measurement in the microarray were converted to a value of relative abundance of a mrna molecule through the data reduction procedure reported by izarrzi et al.17 data processing and analyses were performed with affymetrix genechip command console gcos affymetrix httpwww.affymetrix.com genedata analyst genedata ag www.genedata.com tibco spotfire decisionsite tibco httpspotfire.tibco.com umetrics simca p umetrics httpwww.umetrics.com and r bioconductor packages httpwww.bioconductor.org . when each laboratory data set is considered separately do all of them return the same answer as to which mrna level correlates with the biological condition the data for each set was processed according to the same series of transformations depicted in the figure 3 i extraction of numerical values from the raw image tiff file with the affymetrix genechip command console software16 ii normalization according to the quantile normalization and iii summarization of individual probes values into a single mrna level value as described by irizarri et al.17 this quantile normalization assumes that the overall quantity of mrna across the whole range of binned values has to be consistent across similar biological systems . the outcome of these data transformation is a data matrix with the 3 conditions each represented by 5 replicates and 40000 observations ie the affymetrix probe sets representative of their cognate mrna . there were 3 feeding conditions with 5 each laboratory has initiated the quantification with the same source of rna . as shown in the figure 2b the rna samples branched out to different experimental paths from the step following the rna extraction and prior to the rna labeling procedure . in addition based on prior knowledge of the regulation of gene expression it is reasonable to state that the mrna level data matrix is not made of 40000 independent events and that instead there is a fair amount of redundancy . altogether these initial explorations allowed for the conclusion that the rna molecules quantified in this study were not degraded and were suitable for subsequent correlation studies . the data points clustered with regards to the laboratory where the rna has been processed . the latest update on that matter released by the fda study group called the microarray quality control maqc advised the research community that overall data sets collected from various platforms perform relatively in concordance to each other.10 2 comments might be added to the current recommendations of the maqc group i no study was performed with respect to the other component of the high throughput rna measurement ie the preparation of the labeled rna ii despite some overlap between the results return from the same biological sample from 2 distinct assay platforms there remains a large fraction of observations that are due to the idiosyncrasy of the measurement . the overlap between the 5 data sets shown in the table 1 are likely to be the genuinely differential mrna levels correlating with the environmental challenge submitted to the biological system .", " this study was conducted to investigate the following

lipids and other cellular macromolecules whose functions are indispensable for cell survival . 8oxodg has also been implicated in an event called transcriptional mutagenesis tm whereby a misincorporated adenine in the transcribing mrna leads to the generation of mutated species of protein figure 1 . neuronal dysfunctions have been linked to mutations or differential expression of base excision repair enzymes like ogg1 xrcc1 single strand break repair enzymes like tdp1 aprataxin and double strand break repair enzymes like atm and nbs1 . 8oxodg the most frequent dna lesion caused by oxidative stress is often associated with neurodegenerative diseases including pd . 8oxodg derived tm species may trigger this process leading to the pathogenesis of pd . comprehensive investigation

disturbances.12 in addition to these structures valenstein et al . we report on a patient who developed both verbal and visual memory deficits after an acute infarction of the retrosplenial cortex . we considered that the amnesia of our patient was due to the retrosplenial lesion because memory related structures other than the retrosplenium were intact . although the mild perfusion delay to the left pca territory might have contributed to his amnesia there were no significant changes in the relative cerebral blood volume and cerebral blood flow compared with the corresponding contralateral regions fig . however we could not exclude the possibility of other small infarctions being present in the areas related to the memory function because we did observe point lesions in the left central thalamus and left pca territory . in contrast there are reported cases of a single right retrosplenial lesion causing both visual and verbal memory deficits.5 there is strong evidence that the right medial temporal lobe is involved in navigation and it now appears that input of the hippocampus and related structures receive from and convey to the right retrosplenial cortex has a similar spatial preference while the left medial temporal and left retrosplenial cortices appear primarily concerned with more general aspects of episodic memory.346 however there are recent studies that can explain the presence of both visual and verbal amnesias in our case . although bilateral retrosplenial lesions tend to have a poor prognosis retrosplenial amnesia generally recovers rapidly.48 each retrosplenium receives major inputs from the contralateral retrosplenium the orbital and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex the anterior cingulate cortex parahippocampal cortex superior temporal sulcus precuneus claustrum and the anterior and lateral thalamic nuclei.9 therefore a good prognosis may be partly due to functional substitution of the counterpart retrosplenium or other parts of the cerebrum . however in the case of yasuda et al.5 which showed a poor prognosis the lesion encroached the retrosplenium more posteriorly although the size and location of the cerebral infarction were similar to those in our case .", " the asthma quality of life questionnaire aqlq is a disease specific instrument that was developed in 1992 specifically for use in clinical studies . piores escores

help exclude bacterial infections and thus reduce overtreatment with antibiotics when comparing our results with those of a similar study performed by mermond et al there is a difference in bacterial sputum yield 25 vs 50 . another limitation of our study is that we can not rule out the possibility that occasionally the induced sputum did not reflect the etiology of the alrti because we did not

resistance in rio de janeiro s swampy lowlands before he systematised and published his findings in the first volume of memrias do instituto oswaldo cruz . in an article also published in 1910 they stated that they had been prepared for some quinine resistance in the malaria contracted in inland brazil but they had been taken aback by its strength . according to werner research by gustav giemsa and heinrich schaumann had demonstrated that the level of alkaloid in human blood was too low for a new generation of resistant parasites to develop from the fertilisation of the insect . according to nocht 1919 the trypanosomes resistance to drugs was stable and was maintained after many passages while quinine resistance disappeared in plasmodia after prolonged interruption of medication in the same host . certain authors suggested that many supposed cases of biological quinine resistance were not just down to human resistance and the inadequate use of the drug but also to the general state of the patients who suffered from malnutrition stress and fatigue because of the physical and emotional impact of the war . at the time of the war few german doctors were familiar with the clinical aspects of malaria and how to treat and prevent it because according to rodenwaldt having been eliminated from germany half a century ago except for small enclaves malaria was no more than a curiosity in medical teaching before the war. in a bid to make some sense of the arguments and opinions that abounded martin mayer distinguished two forms of resistance chininabstmpfung dulling or insensitivity to quinine due to factors within the patient s body that made the individual unresponsive to the alkaloid and chiningewhnung adaptation to quinine referring to what took place inside the parasite . repulsion theory proposed by julius morgenroth in 1917 was that quinine would build up inside erythrocytes and would there repel the parasites by chemostatic action preventing them from penetrating the cell . he did not see this property as being an inheritance of acquired modifications in this case as in others it is naturally far more reasonable to concede that isolated races of malaria parasites had differing resistances to quinine and that by treating an infected person with the drug a more resistant race that already existed was simply cultivated in the pure form . they both held that the parasite developed resistance to quinine over several generations maintaining or increasing its resistant features in its passage through mosquitoes . in the tropics selection did not take place because the native population had a degree of immunity to the disease and almost never took quinine while europeans were generally treated correctly . according to schilling the conditions that neiva nocht werner mhlens and others have presented as being propitious for the development of quinine resistant races are valid . according to leo slater by different routes from those of neiva and other tropical medicine specialists researchers working on new drugs for malaria did their best to reconstitute the complex connections between parasite host and vector in the laboratory . as had been the case when the theory of quinine resistance had been formulated it was also in a campaign to fight malaria in itatinga in 1905 that chagas formulated his hypothesis about domestic infection by anophelines which would be called on years later to support the campaign to kill malaria vectors by using ddt inside homes . according to neiva one of the factors that exacerbated malaria amongst these population groups was the incorrect use of quinine which was sold mainly in the form of a sulphate that was effective neither for prevention nor for treatment . a publication from the following year shows that he saw resistance differently from neiva and rodenwaldt which suggests that the latters hypotheses had not left the theoretical realm my personal views on the matter have always been that the apparent resistance to medicine was less a characteristic of the parasite itself or even of certain strains of parasites than of the infected individual in whom it represented a lowering of the protective powers of the organism .", " in advanced disease which constitutes about 75 of women at presentation this has been the approach for some decades though the 5year survival remains poor

presentation of lch in the limbus which recurred after excision of the primary mass . unifocal involvement is the most common presentation of lch and the bone is the most frequently affected tissue.1 ocular involvement can be observed in 1 to 20 of lch cases.2 the condition may primarily involve the orbit eyelid epibulbar conjunctiva cornea iris vitreous choroid and optic nerve or secondarily infiltrate ocular tissues from surrounding structures.34 intraocular involvement by lch has rarely been reported in letterer siwe disease.5 the orbit is usually involved with unifocal lch which has a distinct tendency for the superotemporal bone at the rim of the orbit.6 the limbus can rarely be involved in unifocal lch presenting clinically as an infiltrative solitary limbal nodule which may be misdiagnosed as amyloidosis fibrous histiocytoma lymphoma and juvenile xanthogranuloma.27 the diagnosis of lch is based on characteristic histopathological features . electron microscopy may also assist the diagnosis by demonstrating intracytoplasmic inclusions named birbeck granules.1 the natural course of untreated lch varies from progressive and fatal systemic disease to localized self limited lesions.8 local resection for unifocal involvement and systemic chemotherapy for extensive multifocal lesions have been proposed as treatment modalities in lch9 however spontaneous regression has been reported in some unifocal lch cases.1 herein we report a case of unifocal lch presenting as an unusual limbal lesion which recurred after primary excision . systemic chemotherapy may be indicated for extensive multifocal and systemic lesions.19 to the best of our knowledge after the report by saxena et al2 our patient is the second case of unifocal limbal lch presenting as a recurrent solitary vascularized nodule . differential diagnoses for limbocorneal lch include dermoid amyloidosis fibrous histiocytoma and juvenile xanthogranuloma.2 in our case a limbal papilloma was the initial clinical diagnosis which should be added to this list . there is only a single case report of limbal lch in which the patient remained asymptomatic for a while after complete excision of the primary lesion but the tumor recurred 15 months afterwards.27 based on clinical and histopathological evaluations the recurrent tumor partially responded to combination chemotherapy and the patient was clinically stable for 5.5 years.7 in our case recurrence developed 10 months after resection of the primary lesion for which repeat resection together with corneoscleral patch grafting were performed and the patient has been tumor free up to 4 months .", " ophthalmological examination revealed right upper lid edema with a large black necrotic area of the lid which was adherent to

and nephrotic syndrome are the most common initial manifestations . amyloidosis was the most common finding in nephrotic syndrome . although either nsaid or an oral steroid is usually effective in aosd some patients with complications of the renal amyloidosis may require sustained therapy with corticosteroid and a cytotoxic agent . the col was also effective in a patient with severe ankylosing

one of the most frequent causes of death among patients with epilepsy . there is strong evidence suggesting that sudden unexpected death in epilepsy sudep is a seizure related phenomenon . since then several cases have been reported in the literature presenting with a drop in heart rate or asystole during the seizure . according to a recent revised definition sudep consists of sudden unexpected witnessed or unwitnessed nontraumatic and nondrowning death in patients with epilepsy with or without evidence of a seizure excluding documented status epilepticus seizure duration 30 min or seizures without recovery in between and asphyxia if postmortem examination does not reveal a cause of death the diagnosis is definite sudep and if there is a preexisting condition before or after autopsy which could have contributed to the death it is classified as sudep plus . strong risk factors for sudep include young age early onset of seizures the presence of generalized tonic clonic seizures male sex and bedtime occurrence . furthermore in cases of epileptic cardiac dysrhythmia isolated eeg or ecg recording may prove insufficient and prolonged simultaneous eeg ecg monitoring may be required . attaining the correct diagnosis is essential because appropriate treatment may prevent cardiogenic sudep which is thought to be related to potentially lethal arrhythmias such as asystole induced by epileptic seizures and to prevent the cardiac side effects of specific antiepileptic drugs . in conclusion cardiological investigation should be included in epilepsy management to search for abnormalities of hr or ischemic events .", " evidence to support involvement of rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility in schizophrenia comes from both nongenetic and genetic studies

found that nutritional status is the prognostic factor that is associated with the mortality in copd.46 weight loss is the major characteristic of malnutrition in copd.7 in 2002 nutritional risk was defined by the european society for parenteral and enteral nutrition espen.8 recently nutritional risk was found to be associated with the exacerbation of copd in the patients who were hospitalized because of copd.9 meanwhile it has been reported that nutritional risk is related to the development of copd in male smokers.10 in addition the exercise capacity is also another factor related to mortality in copd.11 limitation of the exercise capacity seriously affects the quality of life in copd patients.12 therefore many studies have aimed at strategies for improving the exercise capacity of copd patients.1314 however this effective and feasible strategy still needs further exploration . among the total 58 severe copd male patients 25 were assessed as having nutritional risk and assigned to the nutritional risk group . cpet showed that the peak vo2 and peak o2 pulse of the nutritional risk group were significantly lower than those of the no nutritional risk group and there were significant negative correlations between the nrs score and peak vo2 or peak o2 pulse .", "", " nonpulsatile subjective tinnitus is considered a phantom perception the conscious awareness of a percept in the absence of an external stimulus . a recently proposed pathophysiological model of phantom sound based on a predictive brain concept with bayesian updating might explain why tinnitus is

correlates of consciousness that is minimal assembly of brain areas required for consciousness per se 38 39 .", " moreover computed tomography ct scans with 1mm slices were performed to examine the potential insertion pathway of the c1 lateral mass screw and c2 pedicle screw and ct angiography in the area of c1 2 was used to visualize the pathway of the va for examining potential anomalies and reducing the possible complication of va injury . before marking the entry point of the c2 screw the medial border of the c2 pedicle was identified to prevent screw malposition in the spinal canal . in other words if the risk of injuring the va and spinal cord can be predicted preoperatively abandoning screw placement in an ipsilateral side with anatomical variation may be a wise decision .", "

of proinflammatory signaling pathways including nfb 1 2 5 . h pgds contributes to the production of the d and j series of prostanoids in the immune system and is involved in allergic inflammatory response . our study showed that h pgds was constitutively expressed in vitro in macrophages whereas l pgds is induced in a time dependent manner in response to lps or pa103 . in contrast to these proinflammatory effects pgd 2 and its cyclopentenone prostaglandin derivatives also have anti inflammatory properties with functions in resolution of inflammation . although several studies have investigated the role of pgd 2 in inflammation the role of pgd2 in host immune response has been scantly studied . it is now evident that endogenous biochemical pathways such as pgds pgd 2 get activated during defense reactions .", " according to preliminary studies we recognize that ca is able to inhibit tumor in mouse except for these with t cells defect which suggests that immune system

beverages with a high content of refined carbohydrates receiving bottle feed for a prolonged period having deficient hygiene etc . given the strong evidence supporting the relationship of dental caries with irregular dietary patterns and the link between abnormal dietary intake and obesity several reports described the link between caries and weight indicating that obese children had more caries than children in the normal weight group . among the newly erupted permanent first molars teeth 36 and 46 were found with the highest caries prevalence of 15.8 and 15.0 respectively among the female children 8.1 fell into the underweight category and 79.4 fell into the healthy category while 9.7 and 2.8 were considered as at risk of overweight and overweight respectively . comparison of

in children of similar age group in guangzhou the average dmft index 4.31 in our study was significantly higher than that reported dmft index 3.11 in the study of guangzhou . also we utilized two indices dmft and dmft dmft to assess the caries severity in children both in deciduous and mixed dentition . moreover although not focusing on an identical age group our result is consistent with a nationally representative survey based on a dataset of 10800 american adolescents national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes iii 19881994 and nhanes 19992002 which suggested that overweight status may be associated with a somewhat decreased risk for caries . our results showed that underweight children were more likely found with more severe caries disease regardless of

designed mechanism for local and systemic inter neuronal transfer of information within functional brain networks with a complexity superior to that of direct cell to cell contacts or secreted soluble factors belting and wittrup 2008 . the compartments fusing at the plasma membrane of cultured neurons were identified as recycling endosomes because tfr is usually detected in recycling endosomes and rab11 or syntaxin 13 are known regulators of recycling endosomes . as in the case of other cells exosomes isolated from neuron culture media floated on sucrose gradients at a density of 1.11.2 g ml and contained both tsg101 and alix . exosomes also contained ampa but not nmda receptors and the cell adhesion molecule l1ngcam which in the central nervous system is expressed only by neurons maness

allowed us to undertake a thorough analysis of whether withdrawal of inhaled anticholinergics influenced the results observed with tiotropium on reducing copd exacerbations . the number of patients having at least one exacerbation and at least one exacerbation leading to hospitalization was reduced with tiotropium relative to placebo in both d and nd groups as reflected by lower rate ratios tables 2 and 3 . in the case of the towards a revolution in copd health torch study this phenomenon led in effect to two comparisons ie withdrawal of inhaled corticosteroids compared with continuation of inhaled corticosteroids in patients previously taking these agents and introduction of inhaled corticosteroids compared with placebo in patients not previously taking inhaled corticosteroids . as well as demonstrating that tiotropium reduced exacerbations regardless of changes in prior therapy we were also able to demonstrate that tiotropium when compared with placebo improved health related quality of life as measured by sgrq regardless of whether or not patients had been taking inhaled anticholinergic therapy prior to randomization . the effect of ipratropium which is the short acting anticholinergic taken by many patients prior to entry into the tiotropium trials is well understood to be restricted to antimuscarinic smooth muscle relaxation and presumably wears off relatively quickly although there is some evidence that the effects of extended therapy with ipratropium persist longer than the conventional 68hour duration of acute bronchodilation.24 although considered a short acting bronchodilator ipratropium alone or in combination with albuterol has been shown to reduce exacerbations compared with albuterol alone.25 this observation suggests that one should consider whether a rebound effect ie an increase in exacerbation rate might be a consequence of ipratropium withdrawal .", " telepathology is defined as the practice of pathology at a distance

releasing hormone analogs with or without antiandrogens is indicated as front line treatment in metastatic prostate cancer as well as in the adjuvant setting following radical prostatectomy with nodal metastasis or radiation therapy and occasionally in patients with localized disease.1 adt has influence on many metabolic pathways but the most common side effect is reduction of bone density.26 prostate cancer usually spreads to the bone in metastatic disease and treatment with intravenous bisphosphonates is commonly prescribed at this stage in order to reduce skeletal related events.78 loss of bmd correlates with the duration of adt but is more pronounced during the first year of therapy.710 men initiating adt are recommended to have an assessment of risk factors for osteoporosis calcium and vitamin d intake lifestyle modifications and baseline and serial bmd assessment while on adt along with bisphosphonate therapy.1 there is evidence that loss of bmd is a strong predictor of fracture risk.11 treatment with bisphosphonates used to prevent osteoporotic fractures has been shown to increase bone mineral density bmd.12 although the national comprehensive cancer network and american society of clinical oncology guidelines propose baseline bmd assessment and bisphosphonate therapy there has been no systematic review of the utilization of these interventions by practicing physicians in the community . further logistic regression analysis was also done to explore the relationship between history of bone fractures and bisphosphonate treatment age race tumor stage at

summary of all synonymous mutations found in lean and obese subjects fto is a member of the alkb homologue abh protein family which numbers nine homologues in humans 27 . one mutation r96h detected in one lean and one obese subject occurs at an absolutely conserved residue within the putative substrate recognition lid of the protein fig . none of these variants all of which are located in less conserved positions had any significant impact on enzymatic activity fig . although snps in intron 1 of fto are unequivocally associated with adiposity in multiple populations there is still no evidence that those snps influence the expression or splicing of fto itself . as predicted we found that the arginine at position 322 is essential for the catalytic activity of human fto and we have made similar observations for r316q 32 . perhaps more interestingly we have demonstrated that mutation of r96 to histidine in human fto produces an enzyme that is capable of some basal conversion of

through pfo . nonetheless it can affect as the risk factor for several conditions including ischemic stroke platypnea orthodeoxia syndrome and decompression sickness.7 pfo as the cause of cryptogenic stroke is not uncommon hence the occurrence of ischemic stroke with either pe or dvt can be considered as the possible example of paradoxical embolism through right to left shunt.8 among the treatments on the prevention of frequent strokes within a patient who has pfo there are medical options and invasive methods.9 the medical options include the use of antiplatelet agents as well as the prescription of warfarin in the patients with hypercoagulable state or venous thrombosis . in terms of invasive methods it was used to have an operation in the past while the application of device

developing in a leishmania scar have also been documented9 but to our knowledge cases of both leishmaniasis and bcc in the same site and the same lesion are rare.10 however in this case solid organ transplantation and long term immuno suppressive therapy should be considered as risk factors for malignancy . advances in effective immuno suppression after organ transplantation have led to increased risk of malignancies particularly skin cancers11 including squamous cell carcinoma basal bcc and malignant melanoma.12 thus malignancies should be considered in the differential diagnosis of

of ibs is multifactorial we hypothesized that the observed symptoms and development of pi ibs may arise from the interplay between the faecal microbiota the host immune response and psychological factors . moreover we found that the microbial profile of the pi ibs and pi bd groups resembled those suffering from ibs d . in the pathophysiology of ibs is controversial probably reflecting the heterogeneity of the patients as well as the genus bacteroides . altogether these data from several studies allow to hypothesize that the subjects with a microbial profile resembling the imd could be more susceptible for contracting a gastrointestinal infection and later developing pi ibs . 2 built on microbiota based patient stratification will not only give insight into the observed microbiota heterogeneity among ibs patients as well as its partial overlap with healthy controls but also represents a concrete step toward improved diagnostics and novel treatment options with improved efficacy

", " it is known that the brain adaptively recalibrates itself to small ( 100  ms ) auditory  visual ( av ) temporal asynchronies so as to maintain intersensory temporal coherence . \n here we explored whether spatial disparity between a sound and light affects av temporal recalibration . \n participants were exposed to a train of asynchronous av stimulus pairs ( sound - first or light - first ) with sounds and lights emanating from either the same or a different location . following a short exposure phase , \n participants were tested on an av temporal order judgement ( toj ) task . \n temporal recalibration manifested itself as a shift of subjective simultaneity in the direction of the adapted audiovisual lag . \n the shift was equally big when exposure and test stimuli were presented from the same or different locations . \n these results provide strong evidence for the idea that spatial co - localisation is not a necessary constraint for intersensory pairing to occur . ", " nucleosomes , a basic structural unit of eukaryotic chromatin , play a significant role in regulating gene expression . \n we have developed a web tool based on dna sequences known from empirical and theoretical studies to influence dna bending and flexibility , and to exclude nucleosomes . \n nxsensor ( available at ) finds nucleosome exclusion sequences , evaluates their length and spacing , and computes an  \n accessibility score giving the proportion of base pairs likely to be nucleosome - free . \n application of nxsensor to the promoter regions of housekeeping ( hk ) genes and those of tissue - specific ( ts ) genes revealed a significant difference between the two classes of gene , the former being significantly more open , on average , particularly near transcription start sites ( tsss ) . \n nxsensor should be a useful tool in assessing the likelihood of nucleosome formation in regions involved in gene regulation and other aspects of chromatin function . ", " mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue ( malt ) lymphomas are characterized by lymphoepithelial lesions pathologically . \n colonic malt lymphomas are relatively rarer than lymphomas of the stomach or small intestine . \n endoscopically , colonic malt lymphoma frequently appears as a nonpedunculated protruding polypoid mass and/or an ulceration in the cecum and/or rectum . \n we report a unique case of a colonic malt lymphoma presenting as a semipedunculated polyp . a 54-year - old man was found to have a 2-cm semipedunculated polyp in the sigmoid colon during screening colonoscopy . \n the polyp was removed by endoscopic mucosal resection . \n histologic examination of the resected polyp revealed diffuse epithelial infiltration by discrete aggregates of lymphoma cells . \n we diagnosed the tumor as low - grade b - cell malt lymphoma by immunohistochemical staining .

", " diclofenac , a nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug , induces apoptosis on the neuroblastoma cell line sh - sy5y through a mitochondrial dysfunction , affecting some antioxidant mechanisms . \n indeed , the time- and dose - dependent increase of apoptosis is associated to an early enhancement of the reactive oxygen species ( ros ) . \n mitochondrial superoxide dismutase ( sod2 ) plays a crucial role in the defence against ros , thus protecting against several apoptotic stimuli . \n diclofenac decreased the protein levels and the enzymatic activity of sod2 , without any significant impairment of the corresponding mrna levels in the sh - sy5y extracts . \n when cells were incubated with an archaeal exogenous thioredoxin , an attenuation of the diclofenac - induced apoptosis was observed , together with an increase of sod2 protein levels . \n furthermore , diclofenac impaired the mitochondrial membrane potential , leading to a release of cytochrome c. these data suggest that mitochondria are involved in the diclofenac - induced apoptosis of sh - sy5y cells and point to a possible role of sod2 in this process . ", " the contamination of seafood by bacteria of fecal origin , especially escherichia coli , is a widely documented sanitary problem . \n the objective of the present study was to isolate e. coli strains from the gills , muscle , and body surface of farmed nile tilapias ( oreochromis niloticus ) fresh - marketed in supermarkets in fortaleza ( cear , brazil ) , to determine their susceptibility to antibiotics of different families ( amikacin , gentamicin , imipenem , cephalothin , cefotaxime , ciprofloxacin , aztreonam , ampicillin , nalidixic acid , tetracycline , and sulfametoxazol - trimetoprim ) , and to determine the nature of resistance by plasmid curing . \n forty - four strains ( body surface = 25 , gills = 15 , muscle = 4 ) were isolated , all of which were susceptible to amikacin , aztreonam , cefotaxime , ciprofloxacin , gentamicin , and imipenem . \n gill and body surface samples yielded 11 isolates resistant to ampicillin , tetracycline , and sulfametoxazol - trimetoprim , 4 of which of plasmidial nature . \n the multiple antibiotic resistance index was higher for strains isolated from body surface than from gills . \n the overall high antibiotic susceptibility of e. coli strains isolated from fresh - marketed tilapia was satisfactory , although the occasional finding of plasmidial resistance points to the need for close microbiological surveillance of the farming , handling , and marketing conditions of aquaculture products .

", " purpose : of this study was to explore the effect of social support on the levels of anxiety and depression of hemodialysis patients.material and methods:258 patients undergoing hemodialysis were enrolled . a questionnaire developed for the purpose of the study \n was used to collect data through the interview process . apart from socio - demographic , clinical and other characteristics \n , the questionnaire also included the multidimensional scale of perceived social support ( mspss ) to assess social support from significant others , family and friends , and the questionnaire hospital anxiety and depression scale ( hads ) to assess the levels of anxiety and depression of patients.results:53,9% of the participants were male while 34,1% of the participants were > 70 years old . 32,9% and 30,2% of the participants felt high levels of anxiety and depression , respectively . \n analysis of data showed a statistically significant association between anxiety / depression and social support from significant others , family and friends ( p=<0,001 for all associations ) . \n in particular , patients with high levels of anxiety and depression felt less support from their significant others , family and friends . \n the multinomial logistic regression , showed a statistically significant effect of social support from friends in anxiety levels ( p=0,004 ) . \n an one point increase of the support from friends seems to reduce by 57% the probability of having high levels of anxiety . in addition , statistically significant effect of social support from significant others , family and friends was observed on the levels of depression ( p=<0,001 , p=0,001 & p=0,003 , respectively ) . \n specifically , an one point increase of the support from significant others , family and friends it was found to reduce by 77% , 71% and 56% respectively the probability of experiencing high levels of depression.conclusions:phyco-social evaluation is essential when providing holistic care to hemodialysis patients . ", " esophageal achalasia is a motility disorder characterized by impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter and dilatation of the distal two - thirds of the esophagus . \n this condition may be a non - frequent reason of extrinsic compression of left atrium . in turn \n , this can be a cause of some hemodynamic changes such as chest discomfort , dyspnea or reduced exercise tolerance , systemic hypotension and tachycardia . \n we describe a case of a patient with esophagus achalasia compressing the left atrium and inducing hemodynamic compromise . \n the diagnostic methods , as chest x - ray , computed tomography ( ct ) , manometry , and 2d - trans - thoracic echocardiography ( tte ) demonstrated the esophagus dilation , the impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter , and its compression on the left atrium . \n three - d trans - thoracic echocardiography ( 3d - tte ) was firstly performed also . \n this last examination pointed out better than 2d - tte the extrinsic compression of the left atrium due to the esophagus dilatation . \n therefore , 3d - tte is a true improvement for the echocardiographic diagnosis of the left atrial compression induced by esophageal achalasia . ", " due primarily to the increasing shortage of allogeneic donor organs , xenotransplantation has become the focus of a growing field of research . \n currently , micropigs are the most suitable donor animal for humans . however , no standard method has been developed to evaluate the systemic vascular anatomy of micropigs and standard reference values to aid in the selection of normal healthy animals as potential organ donors are lacking . using 64-channel multidetector row computed tomographic angiography ( mdcta ) , we evaluated morphological features of the major systemic vessels in micropigs and compared our results to published human data . \n the main vasculature of the animals was similar to that of humans , except for the iliac arterial system . \n however , diameters of the major systemic vessels were significantly different between micropigs and humans . \n specifically , the diameter of the aortic arch , abdominal aorta , external iliac artery , and femoral artery , were measured as 1.50  0.07 cm , 0.85  0.06 cm , 0.52  0.05 cm , and 0.48  0.05 cm , respectively , in the micropigs . \n this mdcta data for micropig major systemic vessels can be used as standard reference values for xenotransplantation studies . \n the use of 64-channel mdcta enables accurate evaluation of the major systemic vasculature in micropigs . ", " amide hydrogen / deuterium exchange ( h / d exchange ) coupled with mass spectrometry has been widely used to analyze the interface of protein - protein interactions , protein conformational changes , protein dynamics and protein - ligand interactions . \n h / d exchange on the backbone amide positions has been utilized to measure the deuteration rates of the micro - regions in a protein by mass spectrometry1,2,3 . \n the resolution of this method depends on pepsin digestion of the deuterated protein of interest into peptides that normally range from 3 - 20 residues . \n although the resolution of h / d exchange measured by mass spectrometry is lower than the single residue resolution measured by the heteronuclear single quantum coherence ( hsqc ) method of nmr , the mass spectrometry measurement in h / d exchange is not restricted by the size of the protein4 . \n h / d exchange is carried out in an aqueous solution which maintains protein conformation . we provide a method that utilizes the maldi - tof for detection2 , instead of a hplc / esi ( electrospray ionization)-ms system5,6 . \n the maldi - tof provides accurate mass intensity data for the peptides of the digested protein , in this case protein kinase pak2 ( also called -pak ) . \n proteolysis of pak 2 is carried out in an offline pepsin digestion . \n this alternative method , when the user does not have access to a hplc and pepsin column connected to mass spectrometry , or when the pepsin column on hplc does not result in an optimal digestion map , for example , the heavily disulfide - bonded secreted phospholipase a2 ( spla2 ) . \n utilizing this method , we successfully monitored changes in the deuteration level during activation of pak2 by caspase 3 cleavage and autophosphorylation7,8,9 . ", " according to a patient - centered viewpoint , the meaning of harmonization in the context of laboratory medicine is that the information should be comparable irrespective of the measurement procedure used and where and/or when a measurement is made . \n harmonization represents a fundamental aspect of quality in laboratory medicine as its ultimate goal is to improve patient outcomes through the provision of an accurate and actionable laboratory information . \n although the initial focus has to a large extent been to harmonize and standardize analytical processes and methods , the scope of harmonization goes beyond to include all other aspects of the total testing process ( ttp ) , such as terminology and units , report formats , reference intervals and decision limits , as well as tests and test profiles request and criteria for interpretation . \n two major progresses have been made in the area of harmonization in laboratory medicine : first , the awareness that harmonization should take into consideration not only the analytical phase but all steps of the ttp , thus dealing with the request , the sample , the measurement , and the report . \n second , as the processes required to achieve harmonization are complicated , a systematic approach is needed . \n the international federation of clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine ( ifcc ) has played a fundamental and successful role in the development of standardized and harmonized assays , and now it should continue to work in the field through the collaboration and cooperation with many other stakeholders . ", " type 2 diabetes is a heterogeneous disorder that develops as a result of relatively inappropriate insulin secretion and insulin resistance . increased levels of free fatty acids ( ffas ) are one of the important factors for the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and contribute to defective -cell proliferation and increased -cell apoptosis . \n recently , glucagon - like peptide-1 ( glp-1 ) receptor agonists have been shown to possess an antiapoptotic effect , by increasing -cell mass and improving -cell function . \n however , their effects on -cells in vitro against lipotoxicity have not been elucidated completely . in this study \n , we investigated whether the glp-1 receptor agonist exendin-4 displays prosurvival effects in pancreatic -cells exposed to chronic elevated ffas . \n results showed that exendin-4 inhibited apoptosis induced by palmitate in min6 cells . \n after 24  h of incubation , exendin-4 caused rapid activation of extracellular signal - related kinase 1/2 ( erk1/2 ) under lipotoxic conditions . \n the erk1/2 inhibitor pd98059 blocked the antilipotoxic effect of exendin-4 on min6 cells . \n exendin-4 also inhibited the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis . \n this inhibition is associated with upregulation of bcl-2 . \n our findings suggested that exendin-4 may exert cytoprotective effects through activation of erk1/2 and inhibition of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway . ", " ribonucleic acids ( rna ) are hypothesized to have preceded their derivatives , deoxyribonucleic acids ( dna ) , as the molecular media of genetic information when life emerged on earth . \n molecular biologists are accustomed to the dramatic effects a subtle variation in the ribose moiety composition between rna and dna can have on the stability of these molecules . while dna is very stable after extraction from biological samples and subsequent treatment , rna is notoriously labile . the short half - life property , inherent to rna , benefits cells that do not need to express their entire repertoire of proteins . \n the cellular machinery turns off the production of a given protein by shutting down the transcription of its cognate coding gene and by either actively degrading the remaining mrna or allowing it to decay on its own . \n the steady - state level of each mrna in a given cell varies continuously and is specified by changing kinetics of synthesis and degradation . because it is technically possible to simultaneously measure thousands of nucleic acid molecules , \n these quantities have been studied by the life sciences community to investigate a range of biological problems . \n since the rna abundance can change according to a wide range of perturbations , this makes it the molecule of choice for exploring biological systems ; its instability , on the other hand , could be an underestimated source of technical variability . we found that a large fraction of the rna abundance originally present in the biological system prior to extraction was masked by the rna labeling and measurement procedure . \n the method used to extract rna molecules from cells and to label them prior to hybridization operations on dna arrays affects the original distribution of rna . \n only if rna measurements are performed according to the same procedure can biological information be inferred from the assay read out .
